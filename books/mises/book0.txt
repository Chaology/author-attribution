PRE FACE TO
THE NE W EDI TION

H E world is split today into two hostile camps<, fighting each
Tother with the utmost vehemence, Communists and anti-Com­
munists. The magniloquent rhetoric to which these factions resort
in their feud obscures the fact that they both perfectly agree in the
ultimate end of their programme for mankind's social and economic
organization. They both aim at the abolition of private enterprise
and private ownership of the means of production and at the estab­
lishment of socialism. They want to substitute totalitarian govern­
ment control for the market economy. No longer should individuals
by their buying or abstention from buying determine what is to be
produced and in what quantity and quality. Henceforth the
government's unique plan alone should settle all these matters.
' Paternal' care of the 'Welfare State' will reduce all people to the
status of bonded workers bound to comply, without asking questions,
with the orders issued by the planning authority.
Neither is there any substantial difference between the intentions
of the self-styled 'progressives' and those of theItalian Fascists and the
German Nazis. The Fascists and the Nazis were no less eager to
establish all-round regimentation of all economic activities than
those governments and parties which flamboyantly advertise their
anti-Fascist tenets. And Mr. Peron in Argentina tries to enforce a
scheme which is a replica of theNew Deal and the Fair Deal and like
these will, if not stopped in time, result in full socialism.
The great ideological conflict of our age must not be confused
with the mutual rivalries among the various totalitarian movements.
The real issue is not who should run the totalitarian apparatus. The
real problem is whether or not socialism should supplant the market
economy.
It is this subject with which my book deals.
World conditions have changed considerably since the first edition
of my essay was published. But all these disastrous wars and revolu­
tions, heinous mass murders and frightful catastrophes have not
affected the main issue: the desperate struggle of lovers of freedom,
13

P R E FA C E T O N E W E D I T I O N

prosperity and civilization against the rising tide of totalitarian
barbarism.
In the Epilogue I deal with the most important aspects of the events
of the last decades. A more detailed study of all the problems in­
volved is to be found in three books of mine published by the Yale
University Press:

Omnipotent Government, the Rise of the Total State and Total War;l

THE following work is translated from the second German edition
(published 1932) of the author's Die Gemeinwirtschafi (originally
published in 1922). The author, who has lent assistance at every
stage, has inserted certain additions, notably on the problem of
economic calculation and on unemployment (pp. 137 et seq., 485 et
seq.), which are not to be found in theGerman edition, and certain
changes have been made in terminology to meet the convenience of
English readers.

TH E S ECON D G ERMAN EDI TION

T is a matter of dispute whether, prior to the middle of the nine­
I teenth century, there existed any clear conception of the socialist

idea - by which is understood the socialization of the means of pro­
duction with its corollary, the centralized control of the whole of
production by one social or, more accurately, state organ. The
answer depends primarily upon whether we regard the demand for
a centralized administration of the means of production throughout
the world as an essential feature in a considered socialist plan. The
older socialists looked upon the autarky of small territories as 'natural'
and on any exchange of goods beyond their frontiers as at once
'artificial' and harmful. Only after the English Free-Traders had
proved the advantages of an international division of labour, and
popularized their views through the Cobden movement, did the
socialists begin to expand the ideas of village and district Socialism
into a national and, eventually, a world Socialism. Apart from this
one point, however, the basic conception ofSocialism had been quite
clearly worked out in the course of the second quarter of the nine­
teenth century by those writers designated by Marxism as 'Utopian
Socialists'. Schemes for a socialist order of society were extensively
discussed at that time, but the discussion did not go in their favour.
The Utopians had not succeeded in planning social structures that
would withstand the criticisms of economists and sociologists. It was
easy to pick holes in their schemes; to prove that a society constructed
on such principles must lack efficiency and vitality, and that it cer­
tainly would not come up to expectations. Thus, about the middle
of the nineteenth century, it seemed that the ideal of Socialism had
been disposed of. Science had demonstrated its worthlessness by
means of strict logic and its supporters were unable to produce a
single effective counter-argument.
It was at this moment that Marx appeared. Adept as he was in
theHegelian dialectic - a system easy �f abuse by th�se who seek to
dominate thought by arbitrary flights of fancy and metaphysical
verbosity - he was not slow in finding a way out of. the dilemma in
which socialists found themselves. Since Science and Logic had
15

P R E FAC E

TO

SECO N D

G E RMA N

E D IT I O N

argued againstSocialism, it was imperative to devise a system which
could be relied on to defend it against such unpalatable criticism.
This was the task whichMarxism undertook to perform. It had three
lines of procedure. First, it denied thatLogic is universally valid for
all mankind and for all ages. Thought, it stated, was determined by
the class of the thinkers; was in fact an 'ideological superstructure' of
their class interests. The type of reasoning which had refuted the
socialist idea was 'revealed' as 'bourgeois' reasoning, an apology for
Capitalism. Secondly, it laid it down that the dialectical develop­
ment led of necessity toSocialism; that the aim and end of all history
was the socialization of the means of production by the expropriation
of the expropriators - the negation of negation. Finally, it was ruled
that no one should be allowed to put forward, as the U topians had
done, any definite proposals for the construction of the Socialist
Promised Land. Since the coming of Socialism was inevitable,
Science would best renounce all attempt to determine its nature.
At no point in history has a doctrine found such immediate and
complete acceptance as that contained in these three principles of
Marxism. The magnitude and persistence of its success is commonly
underestimated. This is due to the habit of applying the term
Marxist exclusively to formal members of one or other of the self­
styledMarxist parties, who are pledged to uphold word for word the
doctrines of Marx and Engels as interpreted by their respective sects
and to regard such doctrines as the unshakable foundation and ulti­
mate source of all that is known aboutSociety and as constituting the
highest standard in political dealings. But if we include under the
term 'Marxist' all who have accepted the basic Marxian principles­
that class conditions thought, that Socialism is inevitable, and that
research into the being and working of the socialist community is
unscientific - we shall find very few non-Marxists inEurope east of
theRhine, and even in WesternEurope and the United States many
more supporters than opponents of Marxism. Professed Christians
attack the materialism of Marxists, monarchists their republican­
ism, nationalists their internationalism; yet they themselves, each
in turn, wish to be known as Christian Socialists, State.Socialists,
National Socialists. They assert that their particular brand of
Socialism is the only true one- that which 'shall' come, bringing with
it happiness and contentment. TheSocialism of others, they say, has
not the genuine class-origin of their own. At the same time they
16

E D IT I O N

scrupulously respect Marx's prohibition of any inquiry into the in­
stitutions of the socialist economy of the future, and try to interpret
the working of the present economic system as a development lead­
ing to Socialism in accordance with the inexorable demand of the
historical process. Of course, not Marxists alone, but most of those
who emphatically declare themselves anti-Marxists, think entirely
on Marxist lines and have adopted Marx's arbitrary, unconfirmed
and easily refutable dogmas. If and when they come into power, they
govern and work entirely in the socialist spirit.
The incomparable success of Marxism is due to the prospect it
offers of fulfilling those dream-aspirations and dreams of vengeance
which have been so deeply embedded in the human soul from time
immemorial. It promises a Paradise on earth, a Land of Hearts'
Desire full of happiness and enjoyment, and - sweeter still to the

than the multitude. Logic and reasoning, which might show the
absurdity of such dreams of bliss and revenge, are to be thrust aside.
Marxism is thus the most radical of all reactions against the reign of
scientific thought over life and action, established by Rationalism.
It is againstLogic, againstScience and against the activity of thought
itself - its outstanding principle is the prohibition of thought and
inquiry, especially as applied to the institutions and workings of a
socialist economy. It is characteristic that it should adopt the name
'ScientificSocialism' and thus gain the prestige acquired by Science,
through the indisputable success of its rule over life and action, for
use in its own battle against any scientific contribution to the con­
struction of the socialist economy. The Bolshevists persistently tell us
that religion is opium for the people. Marxism is indeed opium for
those who might take to thinking and must therefore be weaned from it.
In this new edition of my book, which has been considerably
revised, I have ventured to defy the almost universally respected
Marxian prohibition by examining the problems of the socialist con­
struction of society on scientific lines, i.e. by the aid of sociological
and economic theory. While gratefully recalling the men whose

field, it is still a source of gratification to me to be in a position to
claim to have broken the ban placed by Marxism on the scientific
treatment of these problems. Since the first publication of this book,
problems previously ignored have come into the foreground of
17

P R E FA C E

G E RMA N

E D IT I O N

scientific interest; the discussion of Socialism and Capitalism has
been placed on a new footing. Those who were formerly content to
make a few vague remarks about the blessings whichSocialism would
bring are now obliged to study the nature of the socialist society. The
problems have been defined and can no longer be ignored.
As might be expected, socialists of every sort and description,
from the most radical Soviet Bolshevists to the E
' delsozialisten' of
western civilization, have attempted to refute my reasonings and
conclusions. But they have not succeeded, they have not even
managed to bring forward any argument that I had not already
discussed and disproved. At the present time, scientific discussion
of the basic problems ofSocialism follows the line of the investigations
of this book.
The arguments by which I demonstrated that, in a socialist
community, economic calculation would not be possible have
attracted especially wide notice. Two years before the appearance
of the first edition of my bookI published this section of my investi­
gations in the Archiv fur Sozialwissenschajt (Vo!. XLVII, No. I),
where it is worded almost exactly as in both editions of the present
work. The problem, which had scarcely been touched before, at
once roused lively discussion in German-speaking countries and
abroad. It may truly be said that the discussion is now closed; there
is to-day hardly any opposition to my contention.
Shortly after the first edition appeared, Heinrich Herkner, chief
of theSocialists of the Chair ('Kathedersozialisten') in succession to
Gustave Schmoller, published an essay which in all essentials sup­
ported my criticism of Socialism. 1 His remarks raised quite a storm
amongst German socialists and their literary followings. Thus there
arose, in the midst of the catastrophic struggle in the Ruhr and the
hyper-inflation, a controversy which speedily became known as the
crisis of the S
' ocialReform Policy'. The result of the controversy was
indeed meagre. The ' sterility' of socialist thought, to which an
ardent socialist had drawn attention, was especially apparent on this
occasion.' Of the good results that can be obtained by an un­
prejudiced scientific study of the problems ofSocialism there is proof

in the admirable works of Pohle, Adolf Weber, Ropke, Halm,
Sulzbach, Brutzkus, Robbins, Hutt, Withers, Benn and others.
But scientific inquiry into the problems ofSocialism is not enough.
We must also break down the wall of prejudice which at present
blocks the way to an unbiased scrutiny of these problems. Any advo­
cate of socialistic measures is looked upon as the friend of the Good,
the Noble, and the Moral, as a disinterested pioneer of necessary
reforms, in short, as a man who unselfishly serves his own people and
all humanity, and above all as a zealous and courageous seeker after
truth. But let anyone measureSocialism by the standards of scientific
reasoning, and he at unce becomes a champion of the evil principle,
a mercenary serving the egotistical interests of a class, a menace to
the welfare of the community, an ignoramus outside the pale. For
the most curious thing about this way of thinking is that it regards
the question; whether Socialism or Capitalism will the better serve
the public welfare, as settled in advance - to the effect, naturally,
thatSocialism is considered as good and Capitalism as evil - whereas
in fact of course only by a scientific inquiry could the matter be
decided. The results of economic investigations are met, not with
arguments, but with that 'moral pathos', which we find in the invita­
tion to the Eisenach Congress in 1872 and on which Socialists and
Etatists always fall back, because they can find no answer to the
criticism to which science subjects their doctrines.
The older Liberalism, based on the classical political economy,
maintained that the material position of the whole of the wage­
earning classes could only be permanently raised by an increase of
capital, and this none but capitalist society based on private owner­
ship of the means of production can guarantee to find. Modern sub­
jective economics has strengthened and confirmed the basis of this
view by its theory of wages. Here modern Liberalism agrees entirely
with the older school. Socialism, however, believes that the socializa­
tion of the means of production is a system which would bring wealth
to all. These conflicting views must be examined in the light of
sober science: righteous indignation and jeremiads take us nowhere.
It is true that Socialism is to-day an article of faith for many;
perhaps for most of its adherents. But scientific criticism has no nobler
task than to shatter false beliefs.
To protect the socialist ideal from the crushing effect of such
criticism, attempts have recently been made to improve upon the
19

P R EFA C E

TO

S ECOND

EDITION

accepted definition of the concept 'Socialism'. My own definition of
Socialism, as a policy which aims at constructing a society in which
the means of production are socialized, is in agreement with all that
scientists have written on the subject. I submit that one must be
historically blind not to see that this and nothing else is what has stood
for Socialism for the past hundred years, and that it is in this sense
that the great socialist movement was and is socialistic. But why
quarrel over the wording of it! If anyone likes to call a social ideal
which retains private ownership in the means of production socialistic,
why, let him! A man may call a cat a dog and the sun the moon ifit
pleases him. But such a reversal of the usual terminology, which
everyone understands, does no good and only creates misunderstand­
ings. The problem which here confronts us is the socialization of
ownership in the means of production, i.e. the very problem over
which a worldwide and bitter stru2"!.!le has been wal!ed now for a
century, the problem X(l't" E�OX�" o{�ur epoch.
One cannot evade this defining of Socialism by asserting that the
concept Socialism includes other things besides the socialization of
the means of production: by saying, for example, that we are actuated
by certain special motives when we are socialists, or that there is a
second aim - perhaps a purely religious concept bound up with it.
Supporters of Socialism hold that the only brand worthy the mime is
that which desires socialization of the means of production for 'noble'
motives. Others, who pass for opponents of Socialism, will have it
that nationalization of the means of production desired from
'ignoble' motives only, has to be styled Socialism also. Religious
socialists say that genuine Socialism is bound up with religion; the
atheistical socialist insists on abolishing God along with private pro­
perty. But the problem of how a socialistic society could function is
quite separate from the question of whether its adherents propose to
worship God or not and whether or not they are guided by motives
which Mr. X from his private point of view would can noble or
ignoble. Each group of the great socialist movement claims its own
as the only true brand and regards the others as heretical; and
naturally tries to stress the difference between its own particular ideal
and those of other parties. I venture to claim that in the course of
my researches I have brought forward all that need be said about
these claims.

tendencies, the bearing which they may have on the aims of
democracy and dictatorship obviously plays a significant part. Here,
too, I have nothing to add to what I have said on the subject i n
various parts of this book (PartI, Ill, i; Part n, n, III, §I; PartIV, v).
It suffices here to say that the planned economy which the advocates
of dictatorship wish to set up is precisely as socialistic as theSocialism
propagated by the self-styled Social Democrats.
Capitalist society is the realization of what we should call
economic democracy, had not the term - according I believe, to
the terminology of Lord Passfield and Mrs. Webb - come into use
and been applied exclusively to a system in which the workers, as
producers, and not the consumers themselves, would decide what
was to be produced and how. This state of affairs would be as little
democratic as, say, a political constitution under which the govern­
ment officials and not the whole people
- decided how the state was
to be governed - surely the opposite of what we are accustomed to
call democracy. When we call a capitalist society a consumers'
democracy we mean that the power to dispose of the means of pro­
duction, which belongs to the entrepreneurs and capitalists, can only
be acquired by means of the consumers' ballot, held daily in the
market-place. Every child who prefers one toy to another puts its
voting paper in the ballot-box, which eventually decides who shall
be elected captain of industry. True, there is no equality of vote in
this democracy; some have plural votes. But the greater voting power
which the disposal of a greater income implies can only be acquired
and maintained by the test of election. That the consumption of the
rich weighs more heavily in the balance than the consumption of
the poor - though there is a strong tendency to overestimate con­
siderably the amount consumed by the well-to-do classes in propor­
tion to the consumption of the masses - is in itself an 'election
result', since in a capitalist society wealth can be acquired and main­
tained only by a response corresponding to the consumers' require­
ments. Thus the wealth of successful business men is always the result
of a consumers' plebiscite, and, once acquired, this wealth can be
retained only if it is employed in the way regarded by consumers as
most beneficial to them. The average man is both better informed
and less corruptible in the decisions he makes as a consumer than as
a voter at political elections. There are said to be voters who, faced

Standard and Inflation, are unable to keep in view all that their
decision implies. The buyer who has to choose between different
sorts of beer or makes of chocolate has certainly an easier job of it.
The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently
new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn�out label is
replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the
insoluble basic problem of Socialism - until it becomes obvious that
nothing has been changed but the name. The most recent slogan is
'State Capitalism'. It is not commonly realized that this covers
nothing more than what used to be called Planned Economy and
State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, Planned Economy, and
State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the 'classic' ideal
of egalitarian Socialism. The criticisms in this book are aimed

I hope that these remarks will convince even the cursory and
superficial reader that my investigation and criticisms do not apply

solely to Marxian Socialism. As, however, all socialistic movements
have been strongly stimulated by Marxism I devote more space to
Marxian views than to those of other varieties of Socialism. I think

prove the best way of preparing the foundation of an understanding
of the politics of the last few decades and years: above all, of the
politics of to-morrow. Only a complete critical study of the ideas
of Socialism will enable us to understand what is happening
around us.
The habit of talking and writing about economic affairs without

the zest out of public discussions on questions vital to human society

with the German historical school, and to-day finds express i on
notably in American Institutionalism, has demolished the authority
of qualified thought on these matters. Our contemporari es consider

that anything whic h comes under the heading of E conomics and
Sociology is fair game to the u nqu alified critic. It is assumed that the
trade union official and the entrepreneur are qualified by virtue of
their office alone to decide questions of political economy. 'Practical
men' of this order, even those whose activities have, notoriously,
often led to failure and bankruptcy, enjoy a spurious prestige as
economists which should at all costs be destroyed. On no account
must a disposition to avoid sh arp words be permitted to lead to a
compromise. It is time these amateurs were unmasked.
The solution of every one of the many economic questions of the
day requires a process of thought, of which only those who compre­
hend the general interconnection of economic phen omena are
capabl e . Only theoretical inquiries which get to the bottom of things
have any real practical value. Dissertations on current questions
which lose themselves in detail are useless, for they are too much
absorbed in the particular and the accidental to have eyes for the
general and the essential.
It is often said that all scientific inquiry concerning Socialism is
useless, because none but the comparatively small number of p eople
who are able to follow scientific trains of thought can understand it.
For the masses, it is said, they will always remain i n comprehensibJ e .

To the masses the catchwords of Socialism sound enticing and the
people impetuously desire Socialism because in their infatuation t hey
expect it to bring full sal vation and satisfy their longing for revenge.
And so they will continue to work for Socialism, helping thereby to
bring about the inevitable decline of the civilization which the nations
of the West have taken thousands of years to build up. And so we must
inevitably drift on to chaos and misery, the darkness of barbarism
and annihilation .
I do not share this gloomy view. It may happen thus, but it
n eed not happen thus. It is true that the majority of mankind are
not able to follow difficult trains of thought, and that no sch ooling
will help those who can h ardly grasp the most simple proposition to
understand complica ted ones.

But just because they cannot think

for themselves the masses follow the lead of the people we caU
educated. Once convince these, and the game is won. But I do not

want to repeat here what I have already said in the first edition of
this book, at the end of the last chapter. 1
I know only too well how hopeless it seems to convince impassioned
supporters of theSocialisticIdea by logical demonstration that their
views are preposterous and absurd. I know too well that they do not
want to hear, to see, or above all to think, and that they are open to
no argument. But new generations grow up with clear eyes and open
minds. And they will approach things from a disinterested, un­
prejudiced standpoint, they will weigh and examine, will think and
act with forethought. It is for them that this book is written.
Several generations of economic policy which was nearly liberal
have enormously increased the wealth of the world. Capitalism has
raised the standard of life among the masses to a level which our
ancestors could not have imagined. Interventionism and efforts to
introduce Socialism have been working now for some decades to
shatter the foundations of the world economic system. '''Ie stand on
the brink of a precipice which threatens to engulf our civilization.
Whether civilized humanity will perish for ever or whether the
catastrophe will be averted at the eleventh hour and the only possible
way of salvation retraced - by which we mean the rebuilding of a
society based on the unreserved recognition of private property in
the means of production - is a question which concerns the genera­
tion destined to act in the coming decades, for it is the ideas behind
their actions that will decide it.

of our day.
The masses
approve of it, it expresses the thoughts and feelings of all; it has set
its seal upon our time. When history comes to tell our story it will
write above the chapter 'The Epoch of Socialism'.
& yet, it is true, Socialism has not created a society which tan
be said to represent its ideal. But for more than a generation the
policies of civilized nations have been directed towards nothing less
than a gradual realization of Socialism. 1 In recent years the move=
ment has grown noticeably in vigour and tenacity. Some nations
have sought to achieve Socialism, in its fullest sense, at a single
stroke. Before our eyes Russian Bolshevism has already accomplished
something which, whatever we believe to be its significance, must
by the very magnitude of its design be regarded as one of the most
remarkable achievements known to world history. Elsewhere no one
has yet achieved so much. But with other peoples only the inner
contradictions ofSocialism itself and the fact that it cannot be com­
pletely realized have frustrated socialist triumph. They also have
gone as far as they could under the given circumstances. Opposition
in principle to Socialism there is none. To-day no influential party
would dare openly to advocate Private Property in the M eans of
Production. The word 'Capitalism' expresses, for our age, the sum
of all evil. Even the opponents of Socialism are dominated by
socialist ideas. In seeking to combat Socialism from the standpoint of
their special class interest these opponents - the parties which par­
ticularly call themselves 'bourgeois' or 'peasant' - admit indirectly
the validity of all the essentials of socialist thought. For if it is only
possible to argue against the socialist programme that it endangers

conscious and explicit assertion of principles of social organization which have been
already in great part unconsciously adopted. The economic history of the century is

Essays (1 889). p. 30.

the particular interests of one part of humanity, one has really
affirmed Socialism. If one complains that the system of economic
and social organization which is based on private property in the
means of production does not sufficiently consider the interests of the
community, that it serves only the purposes of single strata, and that
it limits productivity; and if therefore one demands with the sup­
porters of the various 'social-political' and 'social-reform' movements,
state interference in all fields of economic life, then one has funda­
mentally accepted the principle of the socialist programme. Or
again, if one can only argue againstSocialism that the imperfections
of human nature make its realization impossible, or that it is in­
expedient under existing economic conditions to proceed at once to
socialization, then one merely confesses that one has capitulated to
socialist ideas. The nationalist, too, affirms Socialism, and objects
only to its Internationalism. He wishes to combine Socialism with
the ideas of Imperialism and the struggle against foreign nations.
He is a national, not an international socialist; but he, also, approves
of the essential principles of Socialism. �
The supporters of Socialism therefore are not confined to the
Bolshevists and their friends outside Russia or to the members of
the numerous socialist parties: all are socialists who consider the
socialistic order of society economically and ethically superior to
that based on private ownership of the means of production, even
though they may try for one reason or another to make a tem­
porary or permanent compromise between their socialistic ideal and
the particular interests which they believe themselves to represent.
If we defineSocialism as broadly as this we see that the great majority
of people are withSocialism to-day. Those who confess to the prin­
ciples of Liberalism and who see the only possible form of economic

real triumph 'in the hearts of the possessing classes'; through this 'the moral force

for resistance has been taken away from these classes'. (Foerster, Christentum und

that the socialist ideas had found supporters among employers. He mentions that

stand their own activity in the national economy with so little clarity that they hold the

society in an order based on private ownership of the means of
production are few indeed.
One striking fact illustrates the success of socialist ideas: namely,
that we have grown accustomed to designating as Socialism only that
policy which aims to enact the socialist programme immediately and
completely, while we call by other names all the movements directed
towards the same goal with more moderation and reserve, and even
describe these as the enemies of Socialism. This can only have come
about because few real opponents of Socialism are left. Even in
England, the home of Liberalism, a nation which has grown rich
and great through its liberal policy, people no longer know what
Liberalism really means. The English 'Liberals' of to-day are more
or less moderate socialists. 1 In Germany, which never really knew
Liberalism and which has become impotent and impoverished
through its anti-liberal policy, people have hardly a conception of
what Liberalism may be.
lt is on the complete victory of the socialist idea in the last decades
that the great power of Russian Bolshevism rests. What makes
Bolshevism strong is not the Soviets' artillery and machine-guns but
the fact that the whole world receives its ideas sympathetically.
Many socialists consider the Bolshevists' enterprise premature and
look to the future for the triumph of Socialism. But no socialist can
fail to be stirred by the words with which the Third International
summons the peoples of the world to make war on Capitalism. Over
the whole earth is felt the urge towards Bolshevism. Among the
weak. and lukewarm sympathy is mixed with horror and with the
admiration which the courageous believer always awakens in the
timid opportunist. But bolder and more consistent people greet with­
out hesitation the dawn of a new epoch.

§2
The scientific analysis of socialism
1 ne starting-point of socialist doctrine is the criticism of the
bourgeois order of society. We are aware that socialist writers have
not been very successful in this respect. We know that they have mis­
conceived the working of the economic mechanism, and that they

INTRODUCTION
have not understood the function of the various institutions of the
social order which is based on division of labour and on private
ownership of the means of production. It has not been difficult to
show the mistakes socialistic theorists have made in analysing the
economic process: critics have succeeded in proving their economic
doctrines to be gross errors. Yet to ask whether the capitalist order
of society is more or less defective is hardly a decisive answer to the
question whether Socialism would be able to provide a better sub­
stitute. It is not sufficient to have proved that the social order based
on private ownership of the means of production has faults and that
it has not created the best of all possible worlds; it is necessary to
show further that the socialistic order is better. This only a few
socialists have tried to prove, and these have done so for the most
part in a thoroughly unscientific, some even in a frivolous, manner.
The science of Socialism is rudimentary, and just that kind of
Socialism which calis itself S
' cientific' is not the last to be blamed
for this. Marxism has not been satisfied to present the coming of
Socialism as an inevitable stage of social evolution. Had it done only
this it could not have exerted that pernicious influence on the scientific
treatment of the problems of social life which must be laid to its
charge. Had it done nothing except describe the socialistic order of
society as the best conceivable form of social life it could never have
had such injurious consequences. But by means of sophistry it has
prevented the scientific treatment of sociological problems and has
poisoned the intellectual atmosphere of the time.
According to the Marxist conception, one's social condition
determines one's way. of thought. His membership of a social class
decides what views a writer will express. He is not able to grow out
of his class or to free his thoughts from the prescriptions of his class
interests. 1 Thus the possibility of a general science which is valid for
all men, whatever their class, is contested. It was only another step
for Dietzgen to proceed to the construction of a special proletarian
logic.' But truth lies with the proletarian science only: 'the ideas of
proletarian logic are not party ideas, but the consequences of logic

pure and simple.' 1 Thus Marxism protects itself against all unwel­
come criticism. The enemy is not refuted: enough to unmask him as
a bourgeois.- Marxism criticizes the achievements of all those who
think otherwise by representing them as the venal servants of the
bourgeoisie. Marx and Engels never tried to refute their opponents
with argument. They insulted, ridiculed, derided, slandered, and
traduced them, and in the use of these methods their followers are
not less expert. Their polemic is directed never against the argument
of the opponent, but always against his person. Few have been able
to withstand such tactics. Few indeed have been courageous enough
to oppose Socialism with that remorseless criticism which it is the
duty of the scientific thinker to apply to every subject of inquiry.
Only thus is to be explained the fact that supporters and opponents
of Socialism have unquestioningly obeyed the prohibition which
Marxism has laid on any closer discussion of the economic and social
conditions of the socialist community. Marxism declares on the one
hand that the socialization of the means of production is the end
towards which economic evolution leads with the inevitability of a
natural law; on the other hand it represents such socialization as the
aim of its political effort. In this way he expounded the first principle
of socialist organization. The purpose of the prohibition to study the
working of a socialist community, which was justified by a series of
threadbare arguments, was really intended to prevent the weaknesses
ofMarxist doctrines from coming clearly to light in discussions regard­
ing the creation of a practicable socialist society. A clear exposition of
the nature of socialist society might have damped the enthusiasm of
the masses, who sought in Socialism salvation from all earthly ills.
The successful suppression of these dangerous inquiries, which had
brought about the downfall of all earlier socialistic theories, was one
ofMarx's most skilful tactical moves. Only because people were ·not

- It is a fine irony of history that even Marx suffered this fate. Untermann finda
that 'even the mental life of typical proletarian thinkers of the Marxist school' contain
'remains of past epochs of thought, if only in rudimentary form. These rudiments
will appear all the stronger the more the thought stages lived through before the thinker
became Marxist were passed in a bourgeois or feudal milieu. This was notoriously
so with Marx, Engels, Plechanow, Kautsky, Mehring, and other prominent Marxists.'
(Untermann, Die Logischen Jt.langel des engeren Marxismus, Munchen 1910, p. 125.)
And De Man believes that to understand 'the individuality and variety of the theories'
one would have to consider, besides the thinker's general social background, also his
own economic and social life - a ' Bourgeois' life . . . 'in the case of the college-trained
Marx'. (De Man, Zur Psychologie des Sozialismus, New Edition, Jena 1927, p. 17.)

29

I NTRODUCTION
allowed to talk or to think about the nature of the socialist community
was Socialism able to become the dominant political movement of
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
These statements can hardly be illustrated better than by a quota­
tion from the writings of Hermann Cohen, one of those who, in the
decades immediately preceding the world war, exerted the strongest
influence on German thought. 'To-day,' says Cohen, 'no want of
understanding prevents us from recognizing the kernel of the social
question and therefore, even if only furtively, the necessity of social
reform policy, but only the evil, or the not sufficiently good, will.
The unreasonable demand that it should unveil the picture of the
future state for the general view, with which attempts are made to
embarrass party Socialism, can be explained only by the fact that
such defective natures exist. The state presupposes law, but these
people ask what the state would look like rather than what are the
ethical requirements of law. By thus reversing the concepts one con­
fuses the ethics of Socialism with the poesy of the Utopias. But
ethics are not poetry and the idea has truth without image. Its image
is the reality which is only to arise according to its prototype. The
socialist idealism can to-day be looked upon as a general truth of
public consciousness, though as one which is still, nevertheless, an
open secret. Only the egoism implicit in ideals of naked covetous­
ness, which is the true materialism, denies it a faith.' 1 The man who
wrote and thought thus was widely praised as the greatest and most
daring German thinker of his time, and even opponents of his teach­
ing respected him as an intellect. Just for that reason it is necessary
to stress that Cohen not only accepts without criticism or reserve the
demands of Socialism and acknowledges the prohibition against
attempts to examine conditions in the socialist community, but that
he represents as a morally inferior being anyone who tries to em­
barrass 'party-Socialism' with a demand for light upon the problems
of socialist economies. That the daring of a thinker whose criticism
otherwise spares nothing should stop short before a mighty idol of
his time is a phenomenon which may be observed often enough in
the history of thought - even Cohen's great exemplar, Kant, is
accused of this.s But that a philosopher should charge with ill-will,

defective disposition, and naked covetousness not merely all those of
a different opinion but all who even touch on a problem dangerous
to those in authority - this, fortunately, is something of which the
history of thought can show few examples.
Anyone who failed to comply unconditionally with this coercion
was proscribed and outlawed. In this way Socialism was able from
year to year to win more and more ground without anyone being
moved to make a fundamental investigation of how it would work.
Thus, when one day Marxian Socialism assumed the reins of power,
and sought to put its complete programme into practice, it had to
recognize that it had no distinct idea of what, for decades, it had
been trying to achieve.
A discussion of the problems of the socialist community is there­
fore of the greatest importance, and not only for understanding
the contrast between liberal and socialist policy. Without such a
discussion it is not possible to understand the situations which have
developed since the movement towards nationalization and munici­
palization commenced. Until now economics - with a compre­
hensible but regrettable onesidedness - has investigated exclusively
the mechanism of a society based on private ownership of the means
of production. The gap thus created must be filled.
The question whether society ought to be built up on the basis of
private ownership of the means of production or on the basis of
public ownership of the means of production is political. Science can­
not decide it; Science cannot pronounce a judgment on the relative
values of the forms of social organization. But Science alone, by
examining the effects of institutions, can lay the foundations for an
understanding of society. Though the man of action, the politician,
may sometimes pay no attention to the results of this examination,
the man of thought will never cease to inquire into all things accessible
to human intelligence. And in the long run thought must determine
action.

§3
Alternative modes of approach to the analYsis of Socialism
There are two ways of treating the problems which Socialism
sets to Science.
31

INTRODUCTION

The cultural philosopher may deal with Socialism by trying to
place it in order among all other cultural phenomena. He inquires
into its intellectual derivation, he examines its relation to other forms
of social life, he looks for its hidden sources in the soul of the indi­
vidual, he tries to understand it as a mass phenomenon. He examines
its effects on religion and philosophy, on art and literature. He tries
to show the relation in which it stands to the natural and mental
sciences of the time. He studies it as a style of life, as an utterance of
the psyche, as an expression of ethical and aesthetic beliefs. This is
the cultural-historical-psychological way. Ever trodden and re­
trodden, it is the way of a thousand books and essays.
We must never judge a scientific method in advance. There is
only one touchstone for its ability to achieve results: success. It is
quite possible that the cultural-historical-psychological method will
also contribute much towards a solution of the problems which
Socialism has set to Science. That its results have been so unsatis­
factory is to be ascribed not only to the incompetence and political
prejudices of those who have undertaken the work, but above all to
the fact that the sociological-economic treatment of the problems
must precede the cultural-historical-psychological. For Socialism is
a programme for transforming the economic life and constitution of
society according to a defined ideal. To understand its effects in other
fields of mental and cultural life one must first have seen clearly its
social and economic significance. As long as one is still in doubt
about this it is unwise to risk a cultural-historical-psychological
interpretation. One cannot speak of the ethics of Socialism before
one has cleared up its relation to other moral standards. A relevant
analysis of its reactions on religion and public life is impossible when
one has only an obscure conception of its essential reality. It is
impossible to discuss Socialism at all without having first and fore­
most examined the mechanism of an economic order based on public
ownership of the means of production.
This comes out clearly at each of the points at which the cultural­
historical-psychological method usually starts. Followers of this
method regard Socialism as the final consequences of the democratic
idea of equality without having decided what democracy and
equality really mean or in what relation they stand to each other,
and without having considered whether Socialism is essentially or
only generally concerned with the idea of equality. Sometimes they
32

I N T R OD U C T I ON
refer to Socialism as a reaction of the psyche to the spiritual desola­
tion created by the rationalism inseparable from Capitalism; some­
times again they assert that Socialism aims at the highest rationaliza­
tion of material life, a rationalization which Capitalism could
never attain. 1 Those who engulf their cultural and theoretical exposi­
tion of Socialism in a chaos of mysticism and incomprehensible
phrases need not be discussed here.
The researches of this book are to be directed above all to the
sociological and economic problems of Socialism. We must treat
these before we can discuss the cultural and psychological problems.
Only on the results of such research can we base studies of the culture
and psychology of Socialism. Sociological and economic research
alone can provide a firm foundation for those expositions - so much
more attractive to the great public -- which present a valuation of

nature of ownership

EGARDED as a sociological category ownership appears as the
Rpower to use economic goods. An owner is he who disposes of
an economic good.
Thus talte sociological and juristic concepts of ownership are
different. This, of course, is natural, and one can only be surprised
that the fact is still sometimes overlooked. From the sociological and
economic point of view, ownership is the having of the goods which
the economic aims of men require. 1 This having may be called the
natural or original ownership, as it is purely a physical relationship
of man to the goods, independent of social relations between men or
of a legal order. The significance of the legal concept of property
lies just in this - that it differentiates between the physical has and
the legal should have. The Law recognizes owners and possessors who
lack this natural having, owners who do not have, but ought to have.
In the eyes of the Law 'he from whom has been stolen' remains
owner, while the thief can never acquire ownership. Economically,
however, the natural having alone is relevant, and the economic
significance of the legal should have lies only in the support it lends to
the acquisition, the maintenance, and the regaining of the natural

having.
To the Law ownership is a uniform institution. It makes no
difference whether goods of the first order or goods of higher
order form its subject, or whether it deals with durable consumption
goods or non-durable consumption goods. The formalism of the Law,
divorced as it is from any economic basis, is clearly expressed in this
fact. Of course, the Law cannot isolate itself completely from

Gilterlehre, Innsbruck 1881, p. 37.

OWNERSHIP
economic differences which may be relevant. The peculiarity of land
as a means of production is, partly, what gives the ownership of real
property its special position in the Law. Such economic differences
are expressed, more clearly than in the law of property itself, in
relationships which are sociologically equivalent to ownership but
juristically allied to it only, e.g. in servitudes and, especially, in
usufruct. But on the whole, in Law formal equality covers up
material differences.
Considered economically, ownership is by no means uniform.
Ownership in consumption goods and ownership in production goods
differ in many ways, and in both cases, again, we must distinguish
between durable goods and goods that are used up.
Goods of the first order, the consumption goods, serve the im­
mediate satisfaction of wants. In so far as they are goods that are
used up, goods, that is, which in their nature can be used but once,
and which lose their quality as goods when they are used, the signifi­
cance of ownership lies practically in the possibility of consuming
them. The owner may also allow his goods to spoil unenjoyed or
even permit thelm to be destroyed intentionally, or he may give them
in exchange or give them away. In every case he disposes of their
use, which cannot be divided.
The position is a little different with goods of lasting use, those
consumption goods that can be used more than once. They may
serve several people successively. Here, again, those are to be re­
garded as owners in the economic sense who are able to employ for
their own purposes the uses afforded by the goods. In this sense, the
owner of a room is he who inhabits it at the time in question; the
owners of the Matterhorn, as far as it is part of a natural park, are
those who set foot on it to enjoy the landscape; the owners of a picture
are those who enjoy looking at it. l The having of the uses which
these goods afford is divisible, so that the natural ownership of
them is divisible also.
Production goods serve enjoyment only indirectly. They are
employed in the production of consumption goods� Consumption
goods emerge finally from the successful combination of production
goods and labour. It is the ability to serve thus indirectly for the
satisfaction of wants which qualifies a thing as a production
good. To dispose of production goods is to have them naturally.

THE NATURE OF OWNERSH I P
The having of production goods is of economic significance only
because and in so far as it leads finally to a having of consumption
goods.
Goods to be used up, which are ripe for consumption, can be had
but once - by the person who consumes them. Goods of lasting use,
which are ripe for consumption, may be had, in temporal succession,
by a number of people; but simultaneous use will disturb the enjoy­
ment of others, even though this enjoyment is not quite excluded by
the nature of the commodity. Several people may simultaneously
look at a picture, even though the proximity of others, who perhaps
keep him from the most favourable viewpoint, may disturb the en­
joyment of any individual in the group; but a coat cannot be worn
simultaneously by two people. In the case of consumption goods the
having which leads to the satisfaction of wants by the goods cannot be
further divided than can the uses which arise from the goods. This
means that with goods to be used up, natural ownership by one
individual completely excludes ownership by all others, while with
durable goods ownership is exclusive at least at a given point of time
and even in regard to the smallest use arising from it. For consump­
tion goods, any economically significant relationship other than that
of the natural having by individuals is unthinkable. As goods to be
used up absolutely and as durable goods, at least to the extent of the
smallest use arising from them, they can be in the natural ownership
of one person only. Ownership here is also private ownership, in the
sense that it deprives others of the advantages which depend upon
the right of disposing of the goods.
For this reason, also, it would be quite absurd to think of removing
or even of reforming ownership in consumption goods. It is im­
possible in any way to alter the fact that an apple which is enjoyed
is used up and that a coat is worn out in the wearing. In the natural
sense consumption goods cannot be the joint property of several or
the common property of all. In the case of consumption goods, that
which one usually calls joint property has to be shared before con­
sumption. The joint ownership ceases at the moment a commodity
is used up or employed. The having of the consumer must be
exclusive. Joint property can never be more than a basis for the appro­
priation of goods out of a common stock. Each individual partner
is owner of that part of the total stock which he can use for himself.
Whether he is already owner legally, or owner only through the
39

OWNERSHIP
division of the stock, or whether he becomes legal owner at all, and
whether or not a formal division of the stock precedes consumption none of these questions is economically material. The fact is that
even without division he is owner of his lot.
Joint property cannot abolish ownership in consumption goods.
It can only distribute ownership in a way which would not otherwise
have existed. Joint property restricts itself, like all other reforms
which stop short at consumption goods, to effecting a different distri­
bution of the existing stock of consumption goods. When this stock
is exhausted its work is done. It cannot refill the empty storehouses.
Only those who direct the disposal of production goods and labour
can do this. If they are not satisfied with what they are offered, the
flow of goods which is to replenish stocks ceases. Therefore, any
attempt to alter the distribution of consumption goods must in
the last resort depend on the power to dispose of the means of
production.
The having of production goods, contrary to that of consumption
goods, can be divided in the natural sense. Under conditions of
isolated production the conditions of sharing the having of production
goods are the same as the conditions of sharing consumption goods.
Where there is no division of labour the having of goods can only be
shared if it is possible to share the services rendered by them. The
having of non-durable production goods cannot be shared. The having
of durable production goods can be shared according to the divisibility
of the services they provide. Only one person can have a given quan­
tity of grain, but several may have a hammer successively; a river may
drive more than one water wheel. So far, there is no peculiarity
about the having of production goods. But in the case of production
with division of labour there is a two-fold having of such goods. Here
in fact the having is always two-fold: there is a physical having (direct),
and a social having (indirect). The physical having is his who holds the
commodity physically and uses it productively; the social having
belongs to him who, unable to dispose physically or legally of the com­
modity, may yet dispose indirectly of the effects of its use, i.e. he who
can barter or buy its products or the services which it provides. In
this sense natural ownership in a society which divides labour is
shared between the producer and those for whose wants he produces.
The farmer who lives self-sufficiently outside exchange society can
call his fields, his plough, his draught animals his own, in the sense
40

THE NATURE O F O WN ER S H I P
that they serve only him. But the farmer wnose enterprise is con­
cerned with trade, who produces for and buys in the market, is
owner of the means of production in quite a different sense. He does
not control production as the self-supporting peasant does. He does
not decide the purpose of his production; those for whom he works
decide it - the consumers. They, not the producer, determine the
goal of economic activity. The producer only directs production
towards the goal set by the consumers.
But further owners of the means of production are unable in these
conditions to place their physical having directly into the service of
production. Since all production consists in combining the various
means of production, some of the owners of such means must convey
their natural ownership to others, so that the latter may put into
operation the combinations of which production consists. Owners
of capital, land, and labour place these factors at L.;'e disposal of the
entrepreneur, who takes over the immediate direction of production.
The entrepreneurs, again, conduct production according to the
direction set by the consumers, who are no other than the owners of
the means of production: owners of capital, land, and labour. Of
the product, however, each factor receives the share to which he is
economically entitled, according to the value of his productive
contribution in the yield.
In essence, therefore, natural ownership of production goods is
quite different from natural ownership of consumption goods. To
have production goods in the economic sense, i.e. to make them serve
one's own economic purposes, it is not necessary to have them physi­
cally in the way that one must have consumption goods if one is to
use them up or to use them lastingly. To drink coffee I do not need
to own a coffee plantation in Brazil, an ocean steamer, and a coffee
roasting plant, though all these means of production must be used
to bring a cup of coffee to my table. Sufficient that others own these
means of production and employ them for me. In the society which
divides labour no one is exclusive owner of the means of production,
either of the material things or of the personal element, capacity to
work. All means of production render services to everyone who buys
or sells on the market. Hence if we are disinclined here to speak of
ownership as shared between consumers and owners of the means of
production, we should have to regard consumers as the true owners
in the natural sense and describe those who are considered as the
41

OWNERSHIP
owners in the legal sense as administrators of other people's property. 1
This, however, would take us too far from the accepted meaning of
the words. To avoid misinterpretation it is desirable to manage as
far as possible without new words and never to employ, in an entirely
different sense, words habitually accepted as conveying a particular
idea. Therefore, renouncing any particular terminology, let us only
stress once more that the essence of the ownership of the means of
production in a society which divides labour differs from that found
where the division of labour does not take place; and that it differs
essentially from the ownership of consumption goods in any economic
order. To avoid any misunderstanding we will henceforth use the
words, 'ownership of the means of production' in the generally
accepted sense, i.e. to signify the immediate power of disposal.

§2
Violence and contract
The physical having of economic goods, which economically con­
sidered constitutes the essence of natural ownership, can only be
conceived as having originated through Occupation. Since owner­
ship is not a fact independent of the will and action of man, it is
impossible to see how it could have begun except with the appropria­
tion of ownerless goods. Once begun ownership con�inues, as long
as its object does not vanish, until either it is given up voluntarily or
the object passes from the physical having of the owner against his
will. The first happens when the owner voluntarily gives up his
property ; the latter when he loses it involuntarily - e.g. when cattle
stray into the wilds - or when some other person forcibly takes the
property from him.
All ownership derives from occupation and violence. When we
consider the natural components of goods, apart from the labour
1 See the verses of Horace:

'Si proprium est quod quis Iibra mercatus et aere est,
quaedam, si credis consultis, mancipat usus:
qui te pascit ager, tuus est; et vilicus Orbi
cum segetes occat tibi mox frumenta daturas,
te dominum sentit, das nummos: accipis uvam
pullos ova, cadum temeti.'
(2. Epistol., 2, 1 58-63). - The attention of economists was first drawn to this passage
by Effertz (,Arbeit und Boden', new edition, Berlin 1897, Vol. I, pp. 72, 79) .

42

VIOLENCE AND CONTRACT
components they contain, and when we follow the legal title back,
we must necessarily arrive at a point where this title originated in the
appropriation of goods accessible to all. Before that we may en­
counter a forcible expropriation from a predecessor whose ownership
we can in its turn trace to earlier appropriation or robbery. That all
rights derive from violence, all ownership from appropriation or
robbery, we may freely admit to those who oppose ownership on
considerations of natural law. But this offers not the slightest proof
that the abolition of ownership is necessary, advisable. or morally
justified.
Natural ownership need not count upon recognition by the
owners' fellow men. It is tolerated, in fact, only as long as there is
no power to upset it and it does not survive the moment when a
stronger man seizes it for himself. Created by arbitrary force it must
always fear a more powerful force. This the doctrine of natural law
has called the war of all against all. The war ends when the actual
relation is recognized as one worthy to be maintained. Out of
violence emerges law.
The doctrine of natural law has erred in regarding this great
change, which lifts man from the state of brutes into human society,
as a conscious process; as an action, that is, in which man is com­
pletely aware of his motives, of his aims and how to pursue them.
Thus was supposed to have been concluded the social contract by
which the State and the community, the legal order, came into
existence. Rationalism could find no other possible explanation after
it had disposed of the old belief which traced social institutions back
to divine sources or at least to the enlightenment which came to man
through divine inspiration. 1 Because it led to present conditions,
people regarded the development of social life as absolutely purpose­
ful and rational; how then could this development have come about,
except through conscious choice in recognition of the fact that it was
purposeful and rational? To-day we have other theories with which
to explain the matter. We talk of natural selection in the struggle for
existence and of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, though

returns to the old theological explanation. In it the state assumes the position which
the theologians assign to God.

43

OWNERSHIP
the birth and development of social institutions by saying that they
were helpful in the struggle for existence, by saying that those who
accepted and best developed them were better equipped against the
dangers of life than those who were backward in this respect. To
point out how unsatisfactory is such an explanation nowadays would
be to bring owls to Athens. The time when it satisfied us and when
we proposed it as a final solution of all problems of being and
becoming is long since past.

It takes us no further than theology or

rationalism. This is the point at which the individual sciences merge,
at which the great problems of philosophy begin - at which all our
wisdom ends.
No great insight, indeed, is needed to show that Law and the
State cannot be traced back to contracts. It is unnecessary to call
upon the learned apparatus of the historical school to show that no
social contract can anywhere be established in history. Realistic

science was doubtless superior to the Rationalism of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries in the knowledge that can be gained from
parchments and inscriptions, but in sociological insight it lagged far
behind. For however we may reproach a social philosophy of
Rationalism we cannot deny that it has done imperishable work in
showing us the effects of social institutions. To it we owe above all
our first knowledge of the functional significance of the legal order
and of the State.
Economic action demands stable conditions . The extensive and
lengthy process of production is the more successful the greater the
periods of time to which it is adapted. It demands continuity, and
this continuity cannot be disturbed without the most serious dis­
advantages. This means that economic action requires peace, the
exclusion of violence. Peace, says the rationalist, is the goal and
purpose of all legal institutions; but we assert that peace is their
result, their function. 1 Law, says the rationalist, has arisen from
contracts; we say that Law is a settlement, an end to strife, an avoid­
ance of strife. Violence and Law, War and Peace, are the two poles
of social life; but its content is economic action.
All violence is aimed at the property of others. The person

and health - is the object of attack only in so far as it hinders the
acquisition of property. (Sadistic excesses, bloody deeds which are
committed for the sake of cruelty and nothing else, are exceptional

VIOLENCE AND C ONTRACT
occurrences. To prevent them one does not require a whole legal
system. To-day the doctor, not the judge, is regarded as their appro­
priate antagonist.) Thus it is no accident that it is precisely in the
defence of property that Law reveals most clearly its character of
peacemaker. In the two-fold system of protection accorded to having,
in the distinction between ownership and possession, is seen most
vividly the essence of the law as peacemaker - yes, peacemaker at
any price. Possession is protected even though it is, as the jurists
say, no title. Not only honest but dishonest possessors, even robbers
and thieves, may claim protection for their possession. 1
Some believe that ownership as it shows itself in the distribution of
property at a given time may be attacked by pointing out that it has
sprung illegally from arbitrary acquisition and violent robbery.
According to this view all legal rights are nothing but time-honoured
illegality. So, since it conflicts with the eternai, immutabie idea of
justice, the existing legal order must be abolished and in its place a
new one set which shall conform to that idea ofjustice. It should not
be the task of the State 'to consider only the condition of possession
in which it finds its citizens, without inquiring into the legal grounds
of acquisition'. Rather is it 'the mission of the State first to give every­
one his own, first to put him into his property, and only then to pro­
tect him in it'.1 In this case one either postulates an eternally valid
idea ofjustice which it is the duty ofthe State to recognize and realize;
or else one finds the origin of true Law, quite in the sense of the con­
tract theory, in the social contract, which contract can only arise
through the unanimous agreement of all individuals who in it divest
themselves of a part of their natural rights. At the basis of both
hypotheses lies the natural law view of the 'right that is born with us'.
We must conduct ourselves in accordance with it, says the former; by

divesting ourselves of it according to the conditions of the contract
the existing legal system arises, says the latter. As to the source of
absolute justice, that is explained in different ways. According to one
view, it was the gift of Providence to Humanity. According to
another, Man created it with his Reason. But both agree that Man's
ability to distinguish between justice and injustice is precisely what
marks him from the animal; that this is his 'moral nature'.
To-day we can no longer accept these views, for the assumptions

OWNERSHIP
with which we approach the problem have changed. To us the idea
of a human nature which differs fundamentally from the nature of
all other living creatures seems strange indeed ; we no longer think
of man as a being who has harboured an idea of justice from the
beginning. But if, perhaps, we offer no answer to the question how
Law arose, we must still make it clear that it could not have arisen
legally. Law cannot have begot itself of itself. Its origin lies beyond
the legal sphere. In complaining that Law is nothing more or less
than legalized injustice, one fails to perceive that it could only be
otherwise if it had existed from the very beginning. If it is supposed
to have arisen once, then that which at that moment became Law
could not have been Law before. To demand that Law should
have arisen legally is to demand the impossible. Whoever does
so applies to something standing outside the legal order a concept
valid only within the order.
We who only see the effect of Law - which is to make peace ­

must realize that it could not have originated except through a
recognition of the existing state of affairs, however that has arisen.
Attempts to do otherwise would have renewed and perpetuated the
struggle. Peace can come about only when we secure a momentary
state of affairs from violent disturbance and make every future change

depend upon the consent of the person involved. This is the real
significance of the protection of existing rights, which constitutes the
kernel of all Law.
Law did not leap into life as something perfect and complete.
For thousands of years it has grown and it is still growing. The age
of its maturity - the age of impregnable peace - may never arrive.
In vain have the systematicians of Law sought dogmatically to
maintain the division between private and public Law which doc­
trine has handed down to us and which in practice they think it can­
not do without. The failure of these attempts - which indeed has
led many to abandon the distinction - must not surprise us. The
division is not, as a matter of fact, dogmatic; the system of Law is
uniform and cannot comprehend it. The division is historical, the
result of the gradual evolution and accomplishment of the idea of
Law. The idea of Law is realized at first in the sphere in which the
maintenance of peace is most urgently needed to assure economic
continuity - that is, in the relations between individuals. Only for
the further development of the civilization which rises on this founda46

V IOLENCE AND CONTRACT
tion does the maintenance of peace in a more advanced sphere be­
come essential. This purpose is served by Public Law. It does not
formally differ from Private Law. But it is felt to be something
different. This is because only later does it attain the development
vouchsafed earlier to Private Law. In Public Law the protection of
existing rights is not yet as strongly developed, as it is in Private Law. 1
Outwardly the immaturity of Public Law can most easily be recog­
nized perhaps in the fact that it has lagged behind Private Law in
systematization. International Law is still more Lackward. Inter­
course between nations still recognizes arbitrary violence as a solu­
tion permissible under certain conditions whereas, on the remaining
ground regulated by Public Law, arbitrary violence in the form of
revolution stands, even though not effectively suppressed, outside
the Law. In the domain of Private Law this violence is wholly
illegal except as an act of defence, when it is permitted under
exceptional circumstances as a gesture of legal protection.
The fact that what became Law was formerly unjust or, more
precisely expressed, legally indifferent, is not a defect of the legal
order. Whoever tries juristically or morally to justifY the legal order
may feel it to be such. But to establish this fact in no way proves tha�
it is necessary or useful to abolish or alter the system of ownership.
To endeavour to demonstrate from this fact that the demands for
the abolition of ownership were legal would be absurd.

§3
The theory of violence and the theory of contract
It is only slowly and with difficulty that the idea of Law triumphs.
Only slowly and with difficulty does it rebut the principle of violence.
Again and again there are reactions; again and again the history of
Law has to start once more from the beginning.

Of the ancient

Germans Tacitus relates : 'Pigrum quin immo et iners videtur sudore
adquirere quod possis sanguine parare.'1 It is a far cry from this view
to the views that dominate modern economic life.
This contrast of view transcends the problems of ownership, and

1 Liberalism tried to extend the protection of acquired rights by developing the
subjective public rights and extending legal protection through the law courts. Etatism
and Socialism, on the contrary, try to restrict increasingly the sphere of private law
in favour of public law.

embraces our whole attitude to life. It is the contrast between a
feudal and a bourgeois way of thought. The first expresses itself in
romantic poetry, whose beauty delights us, though its view of life
can carry us away only in passing moments and while the impression
of the poetry is fresh. l The second is developed in the liberal social
philosophy into a great system, in the construction of which the finest
minds of all ages have collaborated. Its grandeur is reflected in
classical literature. In Liberalism humanity becomes conscious of the
powers which guide its development. The darkness which lay over
the paths of history recedes. Man begins to understand social life and
allows it to develop consciously.
The feudal view did not achieve a similarly closed systematiza­
tion. It was impossible to think out, to its logical conclusion, the
theory of violence. Try to realize completely the principle of
violence, even only in thought, and its anti-social character is un­
masked. It leads to chaos, to the war of all against all. No sophistry
can evade that. All anti-liberal social theories must necessarily
remain fragments or arrive at the most absurd conclusions. When
they accuse Liberalism of considering only what is earthly, of neglect­
ing, for the petty struggles of daily life, to care for higher things, they
are merely picking the lock of an open door. For Liberalism has
never pretended to be more than a philosophy of earthly life. What
it teaches is concerned only with earthly action and desistance from
action. It has never claimed to exhaust the Last or Greatest Secret
of Man. The anti-liberal teachings promise everything. They pro­
mise happiness and spiritual peace, as if man could be thus blessed
from without. Only one thing is certain, that under their ideal
social system the supply of commodities would diminish very con­
siderably. As to the value of what is offered in compensation
opinions are at least divided.'
The last resort of the critics of the liberal ideal of society is to at­
tempt to destroy it with the weapons it itself provides. They seek to
prove that it serves and wants to serve only the interests of single
classes; that the peace, for which it seeks, favours only a restricted
circle and is harmful to all others. Even the social order, achieved
in the constitutional modern state, is based on violence. The free

VIOLENCE AND CONTRACT
contracts on which it pretends to rest are really, they say, only the
conditions of a peace dictated by the victors to the vanquished, the
terms being valid as long as the power from which they sprang con­
tinues, and no longer. All ownership is founded on violence and
maintained by violence. The free workers of the liberal society are
nothing but the unfree of feudal times. The entrepreneur exploits
them as a feudal lord exploited his serfs, as a planter exploited his
slaves. That such and similar objections can be made and believed
will show how far the understanding of liberal theories has decayed.
But these objections in no way atone for the absence of a systematic
theory for the movement against Liberalism.
The liberal conception of social life has created the economic
system based on the division oflabour. The most obvious expression
of the exchange economy is the urban settlement, which is only
possible in such an economy. In the towns the liberal doctrine has
been developed into a closed system and it is here that it has found
most supporters. But the more and the quicker wealth grew and the
more numerous therefore were the immigrants from the country into
the towns, the stronger became the attacks which Liberalism suffered
from the principle of violence. Immigrants soon find their place in
urban life, they soon adopt, externally, town manners and opinions,
but for a long time they remain foreign to civic thought. One cannot
make a social philosophy one's own as easily as a new costume. It
must be earned - earned with the effort of thought. Thus we find,
again and again in history, that epochs of strongly progressive
growth of the liberal world of thought, when wealth increases with
the development of the division of labour, alternate with epochs in
which the principle of violence tries to gain supremacy - in which
wealth decreases because the division of labour decays. The growth
of the towns and of the town life was too rapid. It was more extensive
than intensive.

The new inhabitants of the towns had become

citizens superficially, but not in ways of thought. And so with their
ascendancy civic sentiment declined. On this rock all cultural epochs
filled with the bourgeois spirit of Liberalism have gone to ruin; on
this rock also our own bourgeois culture, the most wonderful in
history, appears to be going to ruin. More menacing than barbarians
storming the walls from without are the seeming citizens within ­
those who are citizens in gesture, but not in thought.
Recent generations have witnessed a mighty revival of the
49

OWNERSHIP
principle of violence. Modern Imperialism, whose outcome was the
World War with all its appalling consequences, develops the old
ideas of the defenders of the principle of violence under a new mask.
But of course even Imperialism has not been able to set in opposition
to liberal theory a complete system of its own. That the theory
according to which struggle is the motive power of the growth of
society should in any way lead to a theory of co-operation is out of
the question - yet every social theory must be a theory of co-opera­
tion. The theory of modern Imperialism is characterized by the use
of certain scientific expressions such as the doctrine of the struggle
for existence and the concept of the race. With these it was possible
to coin a multitude of slogans, which have proved themselves effective
for propaganda but for nothing else. All the ideas paraded by
modern Imperialism have long since been exploded by Liberalism
as false doctrines.
Perhaps the strongest of the imperialist arguments is an argument

which derives from a total misconception of the essence of the owner­
ship of the means of production in a society dividing labour. It
regards as one of its most important tasks the provision of the nation
with its own coal mines, own sources of raw material, own ships,
own ports. It is clear that such an argument proceeds from the view
that natural ownership in these means of production is undivided,
and that only those benefit from them who have them physically. It
does not realize that this view leads 10gicaUy to the socialist doctrine
with regard to the character of ownership in the means of production.
For if it is wrong that Germans do not possess their own German
cotton plantations, why should it be right that every single German

does not possess

his coal mine, his spinning mill?

Can a German call

a Lorraine iron ore mine his any more when a German citizen pos­
sesses it than when a French citizen possesses it?
So far the imperialist agrees with the socialist in criticism of
bourgeois ownership. But the socialist has tried to devise a closed
system of a future social order and this the imperialist could not do.

Collective ownership of the means ofproduction
The earliest attempts to reform ownership and property can be
accurately described as attempts to achieve the greatest possible

equality in the distribution of wealth, whether or not they claimed to
be guided by considerations of social utility or social justice. All
should possess a certain minimum, none more than a certain maxi­
mum. All should possess about the same amount - that was,
roughly, the aim. The means to this end were not always the same.
Confiscation of all or part of the property was usually proposed,
followed by redistribution. A world populated only by self-sufficient
agriculturists, leaving room for at most a few artisans - that was
the ideal society towards which one strove. But to-day we need not
concern ourselves with all these proposals. They become impractic­
able in an economy dividing labour. A railway, a rolling mill, a
machine factory cannot be distributed. If these ideas had been put
into practice centuries or millenniums ago, we should still be at the
same level of economic development as we were then - unless, of
course, we had sunk back into a state hardly distinguishable from
that of brutes. The earth would be able to support but a small
fraction of the multitudes it nourishes to-day, and everyone would
be much less adequately provided for than he is, less adequately even
than the poorest member of an industrial state. Our whole civiliza­
tion rests on the fact that men have always succeeded in beating off
the attack of the re-distributors. But the idea of re-distribution
enjoys great popularity still, even in industrial countries.

In those

countries where agriculture predominates the doctrine calls itself,
not quite appropriately, Agrarian Socialism, and is the end-all and
be-all of social reform movements. It was the main support of the
great Russian revolution, which against their will temporarily turned
the revolutionary leaders, born Marxists, into the protagonists. of its
ideal. It may triumph in the rest of the world and in a short time
destroy the culture which the effort of millenniums has built up.
For all this, let us repeat, one single word of criticism is superfluous.
Opinions on the matter are not divided.

It is hardly necessary to

prove to-day that it is impossible to found on a 'land and homestead
communism' a social organization capable of supporting the hun­
dreds of millions of the white race.
A new social ideal long ago supplanted the naive fanaticism for
equality of the. distributors, and now not distribution but common
ownership is the slogan of Socialism. To abolish private property in
the means of production, to make the means of production the pro­
perty of the community, that is the whole aim of Socialism.

51

OWNERSHIP
In its strongest and purest form the socialistic idea has no longer
anything in common with the ideal of re-distribution. It is equally
remote from a nebulous conception of common ownership in the
means of consumption. Its aim is to make possible for everyone an
adequate existence. But it is not so artless as to believe that this can
be achieved by the destruction of the social system which divides
labour. True, the dislike of the market, which characterizes en­
thusiasts of re-distribution, survives ; but Socialism seeks to abolish
trade otherwise than by abolishing the division of labour and return­
ing to the autarky of the self-contained family economy or at least
to the simpler exchange organization of the self-sufficient agricultural
district.
Such a socialistic idea could not have arisen before private pro­
perty in the means of production had assumed the character which it
possesses in the society dividing labour. The interrelation of separate
productive units must first reach the point at which production for
external demand is the rule, before the idea of common property in
the means of production can assume a definite form. The socialist
ideas could not be quite clear until the liberal social philosophy had
revealed the character of social production. In this sense, but in no
other, Socialism may be regarded as a consequence of the liberal
philosophy.
Whatever our view of its utility or its practicability, it must be ad­
mitted that the idea of Socialism is at once grandiose and simple.
Even its most determined opponents will not be able to deny it a
detailed examination. We may say, in fact, that it is one of the most
ambitious creations of the human spirit. The attempt to erect society
on a new basis while breaking with all traditional forms of social
organization, to conceive a new world plan and foresee the form
which all human affairs must assume in the future. - this is so
magnificent, so daring, that it has rightly aroused the greatest ad­
miration. If we wish to save the world from barbarism we have to
conquer Socialism, but we cannot thrust it carelessly aside.

§5
Theories of the evolution ofproperty
It is an old trick of political innovators to describe that which
they seek to realize as Ancient and Natural, as something which has

52

EVOLUTION O F PROPERTY
existed from the beginning and which has been lost only through the
misfortune of historical development; men, they say, must return to
this state of things and revive the Golden Age.

Thus natural law

explained the rights which it demanded for the individual as inborn,
inalienable rights bestowed on him by Nature. This was no question
of innovation, but of the restoration of the 'eternal rights which shine
above, inextinguishable and indestructible as the stars themselves'.
In the same way the romantic Utopia of common ownership as an
institution of remote antiquity has arisen. Almost all peoples have
known this dream. In Ancient Rome it was the legend of the Golden
Age of Saturn, described in glowing term� by Virgil, Tibullus, and
avid, and praised by Seneca. 1 Those were the carefree, happy days
when none had private property and all prospered in the bounty of
a generous Nature.a Modern Socialism, of course, imagines itself
beyond such simplicity and childishness, but its dreams differ little
from those of the Imperial Romans.
Liberal doctrine had stressed the important part played in the
evolution of civilization by private property in the means of pro­
duction. Socialism might have contented itself with denying the use
of maintaining the institution of ownership any longer, without
denying at the same time the usefulness of this ownership in the

past.
simple and of capitalistic production as necessary stages in the
development of society. But on the other hand it joins with other
socialist doctrines in condemning with a strong display of moral
indignation all private property that has appeared in the course of
history. Once upon a time there were good times when private pro­
perty did not exist ; good times will come again when private
property will not exist.
In order that such a view might appear plausible the young
science of Economic History had to provide a foundation of proof.
A theory demonstrating the antiquity of the common land system
was constructed. There was a time, it was said, when all land had
been the common property of all members of the tribe. At first all
had used it communally; only later, while the common ownership
was still maintained, were the fields distributed to individual mem1 Poehlmann, Geschichte der so::tialen Frage und des So::tialismus in der antiken Welt,

et seq.)

OWNERSHIP
bers for separate use. But there were new distributions continually, at
first every year, then at longer intervals of time. Private property
according to this view was a relatively young institution.

How it

arose was not quite clear. But one had to assume that it had crept
in more or less as a habit through omission in re-distributions - that
is, if one did not wish to trace it back to illegal acquisition. Thus it
was seen that to give private ownership too much credit in the history
of civilization was a mistake. It was argued that agriculture had
developed under the rule of common ownership with periodic distri­
bution. For a man to till and sow the fields one needs only to guaran­
tee him the produce of his labour, and for this purpose annual pos­
session suffices. We are told that it is false to trace the origin of
ownership in land to the occupation of ownerless fields. The un­
occupied land was not for a single noment ownerless. Everywhere,
in early times as nowadays, man had declared that it belonged to the
State or the community ; consequently in early times as little as to-day
the seizing of possession could not have taken place. 1
From these heights of newly-won historical knowledge it was
possible to look down with compassionate amusement at the teach­
ings of liberal social philosophy. People were convinced that private
property had been proved an historical-legal category only. It had
not existed

always,

it was nothing more than a not particularly

desirable outgrowth of culture, and therefore it could be abolished .
Socialists of all kinds, but especially Marxists, were zealous in propa­
gating these ideas. They have brought to the writings of their
champions a popularity otherwise denied to researches in Economic
History.
But more recent researches have disproved the assumption that
common ownership of the agricultural land was an essential stage
with all peoples, that it was the primeval form of ownership (,Urei­
gentum') . They have demonstrated that the Russian Mir arose in
modern times under the pressure of serfdom and the head-tax, that
the Hauberg co-operatives of the Sieger district are not found before
the sixteenth century, that the Trier Geh6ferschaften evolved in the
thirteenth, perhaps only in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
and that the South Slav Zadruga came about through the intro­
duction of the Byzantine system of taxation.2 The earliest German

EVOLUTION OF PROPE RTY
agricultural history has still not been made sufficiently clear; here,
in regard to the important questions, a unanimous opinion has not
been possible. The interpretation of the scanty information given by
Caesar and Tacitus presents special difficulties. But in trying to
understand them one must never overlook the fact that the conditions
of ancient Germany as described by these two writers had this
characteristic feature - good arable land was so abundant that the
question of land ownership was not yet economically relevant.
'Superest ager', that is the basic fact of German agrarian conditions
at the time of Tacitus. 1
In fact, however, it is not necessary to consider the proofs adduced
by Economic History, which contradict the doctrine of the 'Ureigen­
turn', in order to see that this doctrine offers no argument against
private property in the means of production. Whether or not private
property was everywhere preceded by common property is irrelevant
when we are forming a judgment as to its historical achievement and
its function in the economic constitution of the present and the future.
Even if one could demonstrate that common property was once the
basis of land law for all nations and that all private property had
arisen through illegal acquisition, one would still be far from proving
that rational agriculture with intensive cultivation could have de­
veloped without private property. Even less permissible would it be
to conclude from such premises that private property could or should
be abolished .

§I
The State and economic activiry

T is the aim of Socialism to transfer the means of production from
Iprivate ownership to the ownership of organized society, to the
State. 1 The socialistic State owns all material factors of production
and thus directs it. This transfer need not be carried out with due
observance of the formalities elaborated for property transfers
according to the law set up in the historical epoch which is based on
private property in the means of production. Still less important in
such a process of transfer is the traditional terminology of Law.
Ownership is power of disposal, and when this power of disposal is
divorced from its traditional name and handed over to a legal insti­
tution which bears a new name, the old terminology is essentially
unimportant in the matter. Not the word but the thing must be
considered. Limitation of the rights of owners as well as formal
transference is a means of socialization. If the State takes the power
of disposal from the owner piecemeal, by extending its influence
over production ; if its power to determine what direction production
shall take and what kind of production there shall be, is increased,
then the owner is left at last with nothing except the empty name of
ownership, and property has passed into the hands of the State.
People often fail to perceive the fundamental difference between
the liberal and the anarchistic idea. Anarchism rejects all coercive
social organizations, and repudiates coercion as a social technique.
It wishes in fact to abolish the State and the legal order, because it
believes that society could do better without them. It does not fear
anarchical disorder because it believes that without compulsion men
would unite for social co-operation and would behave in the manner
that social life demands. Anarchism as such is neither liberal nor
1 The term 'Communism' signifies just the same as 'Socialism'. The use of these
two words has repeatedly changed during the past decades, b.ut always the question
which separated socialists from communists was only political tactics. Both aim to
socialize the means of production.

THE STATE AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
socialistic : it moves on a different plane from either.

Whoever

denies the basic idea of Anarchism, whoever denies that it is or ever
will be possible to unite men without coercion under a binding legal
order for peaceful co-operation, will, whether liberal or socialist,
repudiate anarchistic ideals. All liberal and socialist theories based
on a strict logical connection of ideas have constructed their systems
with due regard to coercion, utterly rejecting Anarchism. Both
recognize the necessity of the legal order, though for neither is it the
same in content and extent. Liberalism does not contest the need of
a legal order when it restricts the field of State activity, and certainly
does not regard the State as an evil, or as a necessary evil. Its attitude
to the problem of ownership and not its dislike of the 'person' of the
State is the characteristic of the liberal view of the problem of the
State. Since it desires private ownership in the means of production
it must, logically, reject all that conflicts with this ideal. As for
Socialism, as soon as it has turned fundamentally from Anarchism,
it must necessarily try to extend the field controlled by the com­
pulsory order of the State, for its explicit aim is to abolish the
' anarchy of production' . Far from abolishing State and compUlsion
it seeks to extend governmental action to a field which Liberalism
would leave free. Socialistic writers, especially those who recommend
Socialism for ethical reasons, like to say that in a socialistic society
public welfare would be the foremost aim of the State, whereas
Liberalism considers only the interests of a particular class. Now one
can only judge of the value of a social form of organization, liberal
or socialistic, when a thorough investigation has provided a clear
picture of what it achieves. But that Socialism alone has the public
welfare in view can at once be denied. Liberalism champions
private property in the means of production because it expects a
higher standard of living from such an economic organization, not
because it wishes to help the owners. In the liberal economic system
more would be produced than in the socialistic . The surplus would
not benefit only the owners. According to Liberalism therefore, to
combat the errors of Socialism is by no means the particular interest
of the rich. It concerns even the poorest, who would be injured just
as much by Socialism. Whether or not one accepts this, to impute a
narrow class interest to Liberalism is erroneous. The systems, in fact,
differ not in their aims but in the means by which they wish to pursue
them.

57

SOCIALISM
§2
The 'fundamental rights' of socialist theory
The programme of the liberal philosophy of the State was sum­
marized in a number of points which were put forward as the
demands ofnatural law. These are the Rights of Man and of Citizens,
which formed the subject of the wars of liberation in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries. They are written in brass in the constitu­
tional laws composed under the influence of the political movements
of this time. Even supporters of Liberalism might well ask them­
selves whether this is their appropriate place, for in form and diction
they are not so much legal principles - fit subject matter for a law
of practical life - as a political programme to be followed in legisla­
tion and administration. At any rate it is obviously insufficient to
include them ceremoniously in the fundamental laws of states and
constitutions ; their spirit must permeate the whole State. Little
benefit the citizen of Austria has had from the fact that the Funda­
mental Law of the State gave him the right 'to express his opinion
freely by word, writing, print, or pictorial representation within the
legal limits'. These legal limits prevented the free expression of
opinion as much as if that Fundamental Law had never been laid
down. England has no Fundamental Right of the free expression of
opinion, nevertheless in England speech and press are really free
because the spirit which expresses itselfin the principle of the freedom
of thought permeates all English legislation.
In imitation of these political Fundamental Rights some anti­
liberal writers have tried to establish basic economic rights. Here
their aim is twofold : on the one hand they wish to show the insuffi­
ciency of a social order which does not guarantee even these alleged
natural Rights of Man; on the other hand they wish to create a few
easily remembered, effective slogans to serve as propaganda for their
ideas. The view that it might be sufficient to establish these basic
rights legally in order to establish a social order corresponding to the
ideals they express, is usually far from the minds of their authors. The
majority indeed, especially in recent years, are convinced that t.."'-ley
can get what they want only by the socialization of the means of
production. The economic basic rights were elaborated only to show
what requirements a social order had to satisfy, a critique rather than
a programme. Considered from this point of view they give us an
58

FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
insight into what, according to the opinion of its advocates, Socialism
should achieve.
According to Anton Menger, Socialism usually assumes three
economic basic rights - the right to the full produce of labour, the
right to existence, and the right to work. 1
All production demands the co-operation of the material and
personal factors of production : it is the purposeful union of land,
capital, and labour. How much each of these has contributed
physically to the result of production cannot be ascertained. How
much of the value of the product is to be attributed to the separate
factors is a question which is answered daily and hourly by buyers
and sellers on the market, though the scientific explanation of this
process has achieved satisfactory results only in very recent years,
and these results are still far from final. The formation of market
prices for all factors of production attributes to each a weight that
corresponds to its part in production. Each factor receives in the
price the yield of its collaboration. The labourer receives in wages
the full produce of his labour. In the light of the subjective theory of
value therefore that particular demand of Socialism appears quite
absurd. But to the layman it is not so. The habit of speech with
which it is expressed derives from the view that value comes from
labour alone. Whoever takes this view of value will see in the demand
for the abolition of private ownership in the means of production a
demand for the full produce of labour for the labourer. At first it
is a negative demand - exclusion of all income not based on labour.
But as soon as one proceeds to construct a system on this principle
insurmountable obstacles arise, difficulties which are the consequence
of the untenable theories of the formation of value which have estab­
lished the principle of the right to the full produce oflabour. All such
systems have been wrecked on this. Their authors have had to con­
fess finally that what they wanted was nothing else than the abolition
of the income of individuals not based on labour, and that only
socialization of the means of production could achieve this. Of the
right to the full produce of labour, which had occupied minds for
decades, nothing remains but the slogan - effective for propaganda,
of course - demanding that 'unearned' non-labour income should
be abolished.

4th Edition, Stuttgart und Berlin 1910, p. 6.

59

SOCIALISM
The Right to Existence can be defined in various ways. If one
understands by this the claim of people, without means and unfit for
work and with no relation to provide for them, to subsistence, then
the Right to Existence is a harmless institution which was realized
in most communities centuries ago. Certainly the manner in which
the principle has been carried into practice may leave something to
be desired, as for reasons that arise from its origin in charitable care
of the poor, it gives to the necessitous no title recoverable by law. By
'Right to Existence', however, the socialists do not mean this. Their
definition is : 'that each member of society may claim that the goods
and services necessary to the maintenance of his existence shall be
assigned to him, according to the measure of existing means, before
the less urgent needs of others are satisfied' . 1 The vagueness of the
concept, 'maintenance of existence', and the impossibility of recog­
nizing and comparing how urgent are the needs of different persons
from any objective standpoint, make this finally a demand for the
utmost possible equal distribution of consumption goods. The form
which the concept sometimes takes - that no one should starve while
others have more than enough - expresses that intention even more
clearly. Plainly, this claim for equality can be satisfied, on its negative
side, only when all the means of production have been socialized and
the yield of production is distributed by the State. Whether on its
positive side it can be satisfied at all is another problem with which
the advocates of the Right to Existence have scarcely concerned
themselves. They have argued that Nature herself affords to all men
a sufficient existence and only because of unjust social institutions is
the provisioning of a great part of humanity insufficient; and that if
the rich were deprived of all they are allowed to consume over and
above what is 'necessary', everyone would be able to live decently.
Only under the influence of the criticism based on the Malthusian
Law of Population2 has socialist doctrine been amended. Socialists
admit that under non-socialist production not enough is produced
to supply all in abundance, but argue that Socialism would so
enormouslv increase the productivity of labour that it would be
possible td create an earthly paradis� for an unlimited number of
persons. Even Marx, otherwise so discreet, says that the socialist

F UNDAMENTAL R I G HT S
society would make the wants of each individual the standard
measure of distribution. 1
This much is certain, however: the recognition of the Right to
Existence, in the sense demanded by the socialist theorists, could be
achieved only by the socialization of the means of production. Anton
Menger has, it is true, expressed the opinion that private property
and the Right to Existence might well exist side by side. In this casl!
claims of citizens of the State to what was necessary for existence
would have to be considered a mortgage on the national income, and
these claims would have to be met before favoured individuals
received an unearned income. But even he has to confess that were
the Right to Existence admitted completely, it would absorb such
an important part of the unearned income and would strip so much
benefit from private ownership that all property would soon be col­
lectively owned.' If Men�er had seen that the Ri!rht to Existence
�
necessarily involved a right to the equal distribution of consumption
goods, he would not have asserted that it was fundamentally com­
patible with private ownership in the means of production.
The Right to Existence is very closely connected with the Right to
Work.· The basis of the idea is not so much a Right to Work as a
duty. The laws which allow the unemployable a sort of claim to
maintenance exclude the employable from a like favour. He has
only a claim to the allotment of work. Naturally the socialist writers
and with them the older socialist policy have a different view of this
right. They transform it, more or less clearly, into a claim to a task
which is agreeable to the inclinations and abilities of the worker, and
which yields a wage sufficient for his subsistence needs. Beneath the
Right to Work lies the same idea that engendered the Right to
Existence - the idea that in 'natural' conditions - which we are to
imagine existing before and outside the social order based on private
property but which is to be restored by a socialist constitution when
private property has been abolished - every man would be able to
procure a sufficient income through work. The bourgeois society
which has destroyed this satisfactory state of affairs owes to those thus

SOCIALISM
injured the equivalent of what they have lost. This equivalent is
supposed to be represented just by the Right to Work. Again we see
the old illusion of the means of subsistence which Nature is supposed
to provide irrespective of the historical development of society. But
the fact is that Nature grants no rights at all, and just because she
dispenses only the scantiest means of subsistence and because wants
are practically unlimited, man is forced to take economic action.
This action begets social collaboration; its origin is due to the realiza­
tion that it heightens productivity and improves the standard of
living. The notion, borrowed from the most naive theories of natural
law, that in society the individual is worse off than 'in the freer
primitive state of Nature' and that society must first, so to speak, buy
his toleration with special rights, is the corner-stone of expositions
upon the Right to Work as well as upon the Right to Existence.
Where production is perfectlv balanced there is no unemplov­
ment. Un�mployment is' a cons�quence of economic change; a�d
where production is unhindered by the interferences of authorities
and trade unions, it is always only a phenomenon of transition,
which the alteration of wage rates tends to remove. By means of
appropriate institutions, by the extension, for example, of labour
exchanges, which would evolve out of the economic mechanism in the
unimpeded market - i.e. where the individual is free to choose and
to change his profession and the place where he works - the duration
of separate cases of unemployment could be so much shortened that
it would no longer be considered a serious evil. 1 But the demand
that every citizen should have a right to work in his accustomed pro­
fession at a wage not inferior to the wage rates of other labour more
in demand is utterly unsound. The organization of production can­
not dispense with a means of forcing a change of profession. In the
form demanded by the socialist, the Right to Work is absolutely im­
practicable, and this is not only the case in a society based on private
ownership in the means of production. For even the socialist com­
munity could not grant the worker the right to be active only in his
wonted profession; it, also, would need the power to move labour to
the places ,.." here it Vias most needed.
The three basic economic rights - whose number incidentally
could easily be increased - belong to a past epoch of social reform

- -movements. Their importance to-day is merely, though effectively,
propagandistic. Socialization of the means of production has re­
placed them all.

§3
Collectivism and Socialism
The contrast between realism and nominalism which runs
through the history of human thought since Plato and Aristotle is
revealed also in social philosophy. 1 The difference between the

attitude of Collectivism and Individualism to the problem of social

associations, is not different from the attitude of Universalism and
Nominalism to the problem of the concept of species. But in the
sphere of social science this contrast - to which in philosophy the
attitude towards the idea of God has given a significance which ex­
tends far beyond the limits of scientific research - has the highest
importance.

The powers which are in existence and which do not

want to succumb, find in the philosophy of Collectivism weapons for
the defence of their rights. But even here Nominalism is a restless
force seeking always to advance. Just as in the sphere of philosophy
it dissolves the old concepts of metaphysical speculation, so here it
breaks up the metaphysics of sociological Collectivism.
The political misuse of the contrast is clearly visible in the teleo­
logical form which it assumes in Ethics and Politics. The problem
here is stated otherwise than in Pure Philosophy. The question is
whether the individual or the community shall be the purpose. I
This presupposes a contrast between the purposes of individuals and
those of the social whole, a contrast which only the sacrifice of the
one in favour of the other can overcome. A quarrel over the reality
or nominality of the concepts becomes a quarrel over the precedence
of purposes. Here there arises a new difficulty for Collectivism. As
there are various social collectiva, whose purposes seem to conflict
just as much as those of the individuals contrast with those of the

collectiva,

the conflict of their interests must be fought out.

As a

matter of fact, practical Collectivism does not worry much about
this. It feels itself to be only the apologist of the ruling classes and
serves, as it were, as scientific policeman, on all fours with political
police, for the protection of those who happen to be in power.
But the individualist social philosophy of the epoch of enlighten­
ment disposed of the conflict between Individualism and Collectiv­
ism. It is called individualistic because its first task was to clear the
way for subsequent social philosophy by breaking down the ideas of
the ruling Collectivism. But it has not in any way replaced the
shattered idols of Collectivism with a cult of the individual. By
making the doctrine of the harmony of interests the starting point of
sociological thought, it founded modern social science and showed
that the conflict of purposes upon which the quarrel turned did not
exist in reality. For society is only possible on these terms, that the
individual finds therein a strengthening ofhis own ego and his own will.
The collectivist movement of the present day derives its strength
not from an inner want on the part of modern scientific thought but
from the political will of an epoch which yearns after Romanticism
and Mysticism. Spiritual movements are revolts of thought against
inertia, of the few against the many; of those who because they are
strong in spirit are strongest alone against those who can express
themselves only in the mass and the mob, and who are significant
only because they are numerous. Collectivism is the opposite of all
this, the weapon of those who wish to kill mind and thought. Thus
it begets the 'New Idol', 'the coldest of all cold monsters', the State. 1
By exalting this mysterious being into a sort of idol, decking it out
in the extravagance of fantasy with every excellence and purifying
it of all dross, a and by expressing a readiness to sacrifice everything
on its altar, Collectivism seeks consciously to cut every tie that unites
sociological with scientific thought. This is most clearly discernible
in those thinkers who exerted the keenest criticism to free scientific
thought from all teleological elements, whilst in the field of social
cognition they not only retained traditional ideas and teleological

the way by which sociology could have won for itself the liberty of
thought already achieved by natural science. No god and no ruler
of Nature lives for Kant's theory of cognition of nature, but history
he regards 'as the execution of a hidden plan of nature' 'in order to
bring about a state-constitution perfect inwardly - and, for this pur­
pose, outwardly as well - as the only condition in which she can
develop all her abilities in humanity'. 1 In the words of Kant we can
see with especial clearness the fact that modern Collectivism has
nothing more to do with the old realism of concepts but rather,
having arisen from political and not from philosophical needs,
occupies a special position outside science which cannot be shaken
by attacks based on the theory of cognition. In the second part
of his Ideas to a Philosophy of the History of Humanity Herder
violently attacked the critical philosophy of Kant, which appeared
to him as 'Averroic' hypostasization of the general. Anyone who

subject of education and civilization, would be speaking incompre­
hensibly, 'as race and species are only general concepts, except in so
far as they exist in the individual being'. Even if one attributed to
this general concept all the perfections of humanity - culture and
highest enlightenment - which an ideal concept permits, one would
have 'said just as little about the true history of our race, as I would
if, speaking of animality, stoneness, metalness, in general, I were to
ascribe to them the most glorious, but in single individuals self-con­
flicting, attributes'. 1 In his reply to this Kant completes the divorce
of ethical-political Collectivism from the philosophieal concept­
realism. 'Whoever said that no single horse has horns but the species
of horses is nevertheless homed would be stating a downright ab­
surdity. For then species means nothing more than the characteristic
in which all individuals must agree. But if the meaning of the
expression " the human species" is - and this is generally the case ­
the whole of a series of generations going into the infinite (indefinable),
and it is assumed that this series is continuously nearing the line of
its destiny, which runs alongside of it, then it is no contradiction to
say, that in all its parts it is asymptotic to it, yet on the whole meets
it - in other words, that no link of all the generations of the human

race but only the species attains its destiny completely. Mathema­
ticians can elucidate this. The philosopher would say: the destiny
of the human race as a whole is continuous progress, and the com­
pletion of this is a mere idea - but in all intention a useful idea - of
the aim towards which we, according to the plan of Providence, have
to direct our exertions .' 1 Here the teleological character of Collec­
tivism is frankly admitted, and there opens up an unbridgeable
chasm between it and the way of thought of pure cognition. The
cognition of the hidden intentions of Nature lies beyond all experi­
ence and our own thought gives us nothing upon which to form a
conclusion as to whether it exists or what it contains. Such behaviour
of individual man and of social systems as we are able to observe
provides no basis for a hypothesis. No logical connection can be
forged between experience and that which we shall or may suppose.
We are to believe - because it cannot be proved - that against his
,A/ill man does that \vhich is ordained by Nature, ,vha knovvs better;
that he does what profits the race, not the individua1. 2 This is not
the customary technique of science.
The fact is that Collectivism is not to be explained as a scientific
necessity. Only the needs of politics can account for it. Therefore it
does not stop, as conceptual realism stopped, at affirming the real
existence of social associations - calling them organisms and living
beings in the proper sense of the words - but idealizes them and
makes them Gods. Gierke explains quite openly and unequivocally
that one must hold fast to the 'idea of the real unity of the com­
munity', because this alone makes possible the demand that the
individual should stake strength and life for Nation and State. a
Lessing has said that Collectivism is nothing less than 'the cloak of
tyranny'.'
If the conflict between the common interests of the whole and
the particular interests of the individual really existed, men would
be quite incapable of collaborating in society. The natural inter­
course between human beings would be the war of all against all.
There could be no peace or mutual sufferance, but only temporary

truce, which lasted no longer than the weariness of one or all the
parts made necessary. The individual would, at least potentially, be
in constant revolt against each and all, in the same way as he finds
himself in unceasing war with beasts of prey and bacilli. The
collective view of history, which is thoroughly asocial, cannot there­
fore conceive that social institutions could have arisen in any way
except through the intervention of a 'world shaper' of the Platonic
3l)!LLO\)P'Y0�. This operates in history through its instruments, the
heroes, who lead resistant man to where it wants him. Thus the
will of the individual is broken. He who wants to live for himself
alone is forced by the representatives of God on earth to obey the
moral law, which demands that he shall sacrifice his well-being in the
interests of the Whole and its future development.
The science of society begins by disposing of this dualism. Per­

conflict, it is able to understand social institutions without calling
gods and heroes to its aid. We can dispense with the Demit rge,
which forces the individual into the Collectivism against his will, as
soon as we realize that social union gives him more than it takes
away. Even without assuming a 'hidden plan of nature' we can
understand the development to a more closely-knit form of society
when we see that every step on this way benefits those who take it,
and not only their distant great-grandchildren.
Collectivism had nothing to oppose to the new social theory. Its
continually reiterated accusation, that this theory does not appre­
hend the importance of the collectiva, especially those of State and
Nation, only shows that it has not observed how the influence of
liberal sociology has changed the setting of the problem. Collectivism
no longer attempts to construct a complete theory of social life; the
best it can produce against its opponents is witty aphorism, nothing
more. In economics as well as in general sociology it has proved itself
utterly barren. It is no accident that the German mind, dominated
by the social theories of classical philosophy from Kant to Hegel, for
a long time produced nothing important in economics, and that those
who have broken the spell, first Thtinen and Gossen, then the
Austrians Karl Menger, Bohm-Bawerk, and Wieser, were free from
any influence of the collectivist philosophy of the State.
How little Collectivism was able to surmount the difficulties in
67

SOCIALISM

the way of amplifying its doctrine is best shown by the manner in
which it has treated the problem of social will. To refer again and
again to the Will of the State, to the Will of the People, and to the
Convictions of the People is not in any way to explain how the col­
lective will of the social associations comes into being. As it is not
merely different from the will of separate individuals but, in decisive
points, is quite opposed to the latter, the collective will cannot
originate as the sum or resultant of individual wills. Every collec­
tivist assumes a different source for the collective will, according to
his own political, religious and national convictions. Fundamentally
it is all the same whether one interprets it as the supernatural powers
of a king or priest or whether one views it as the quality of a chosen
class or people. Frederick Wilhelm IV and Wilhelm 11 were quite
convinced that God had invested them with special authority, and
this faith doubtless served to stimulate their conscientious efforts and
the development of their strength. Many contemporaries believed
alike and were ready to spend their last drop of blood in the service
of the king sent to them by God. But science is as little able to prove
the truth of this belief as to prove the truth ofa religion. Collectivism
is political, not scientific. What it teaches are judgments of value.
Collectivism is generally in favour of the socialization of the means
of production because this lies nearer to its world philosophy. But
there are collectivists who advocate private ownership in the means
of production because they believe that the well-being of the social
whole is better served by this system. 1 On the other hand, even with­
out being influenced by collectivist ideas it is possible to believe that
private ownership in the means of production is less able than com­
mon ownership to accomplish the purposes of humanity.

§I
The policy of violence and the policy of contract

HE domination of the principle of violence was naturally not
T restricted to the sphere of property. The spirit which put its
trust in might alone, which sought the fundamentals of welfare, not
in agreement, but in ceaseless conflict, permeated the whole of life.
All human relations were settled according to the 'Law of the
Stronger', which is really the negation of Law. There was no peace;
at best there was a truce.
Society grows out of the smallest associations. The circle of those
who combined to keep the peace among themselves was at first very
limited. The circle widened step by step through millennia, until
the community of international law and the union of peace extended
over the greatest part of humanity, excluding the half savage peoples
who lived on the lowest plane of culture. Within this community the
principle of contract was not everywhere equally powerful. It was
most completely recognized in all that was concerned with property.
It remained weakest in fields where it touched the question of
political domination. Into the sphere of foreign policy it has so far
penetrated no further than to limit the principle of violence by
setting up rules of combat. Apart from the process of arbitration,
which is a recent development, disputes between states are still, in
essentials, decided by arms, the most usual of ancient judicial pro­
cesses; but the deciding combat, like the judicial duels of the most
ancient laws, must conform to certain rules. All the same, it would
be false to maintain that in the intercourse of states, fear of foreign
violence is the one factor that keeps the sword in its sheath. 1 Forces
which have been active in the foreign policy of states through mil­
lennia have set the value of peace above the profit of victorious war.
In our time even the mightiest war lord cannot isolate �Jrr�elf COffi=
pletely from the influence of the legal maxim that wars must have

valid reasons. Those who wage war invariably endeavour to prove
that theirs is the just cause and that they fight in defence or at least
in preventive-defence; this is a solemn recognition of the principle
of Law and Peace. Every policy which has openly confessed to the
principle of violence has brought upon itself a world-coalition, to
which it has finally succumbed.
In the Liberal Social Philosophy the human mind becomes aware
of the overcoming of the principle of violence by the principle of
peace. In this philosophy for the first time humanity gives itself an
account of its actions. It tears away the romantic nimbus with which
the exercise of power had been surrounded. War, it teaches, is harm­
ful, not only to the conquered but to the conqueror. Society has
arisen out of the works of peace; the essence of society is peacemaking.
Peace and not war is the father of all things. Only economic action
has created the wealth around us; labour, not the profession of arms,
brings happiness. Peace builds, war destroys. Nations are funda­
mentally peaceful because they recognize the predominant utility
of peace. They accept war only in self-defence; wars of aggression
they do not desire. It is the princes who want war, because thus they
hope to get money, goods, and power. It is the business of the nations
to prevent them from achieving their desire by denying them the
means necessary for making war.
The love of peace of the liberal does not spring from philanthropic
considerations, as does the pacifism of Bertha Suttner and of others of
that category. It has none of the woebegone spirit which attempts to
combat the romanticism of blood lust with the sobriety of inter­
national congresses. Its predilection for peace is not a pastime which
is otherwise compatible with all possible convictions. It is the social
theory of Liberalism. Whoever maintains the solidarity of the
economic interests of all nations, and remains indifferent to the
extent of national territories and national frontiers; whoever has so
far overcome collectivist notions that such an expression as 'Honour
of the State' sounds incomprehensible to him; that man will nowhere
find a valid cause for wars of aggression. Liberal pacificism is the
offspring of the Liberal Social Philosophy. That Liberalism aims at
the protection of property and that it rejects war, are two expressions
of one and the same principle. 1

even modem Imperialism and thus World-War as products of Capitalism. It is

SOC IAL FUNCTION OF DEMOCRACY

The social function of democracy
In internal politics Liberalism demands the fullest freedom for the
expression of political opinion and it demands that the State shall
be constituted according to the will ofthe majority; it demands legisla­
tion through representatives of the people, and that the government,
which is a committee of the people's representatives, shall be bound
by the Laws. Liberalism merely compromises when it accepts a
monarchy. Its ideal remains the republic or at least a shadow­
principality of the English type. For its highest political principle is
the self-determination of peoples as of individuals. It is idle to discuss
whether one should call this political ideal democratic or not. The
more recent writers are inclined to assume a contrast between
Liberalism and Democracy. They seem to have no clear conceptions
of either; above all, their ideas as to the philosophical basis of demo­
cratic institutions seem to be derived exclusively from the ideas of
natural law.
Now it may well be that the majority of liberal theories have
endeavoured to recommend democratic institutions on grounds
which correspond to the theories of natural law with regard to the
inalienable right of human beings to self-determination. But the
reasons which a political movement gives in justification of its postu­
lates do not always coincide with the reasons which force them to be
uttered. It is often easier to act politically than to see clearly the
ultimate motives of one's actions. The old Liberalism knew that the
democratic demands rose inevitably from its system of social philo­
sophy. But it was not at all clear what position these demands
occupied in the system. This explains the uncertainty it has always
manifested in questions of ultimate principle; it also accounts for the
measureless exaggeration which certain pseudo-democratic demands
have enjoyed at the hands of those who ultimately claimed the name
probably unnecessary to deal more fully with this theory, put forward for the unthinking
masses. But it is not inappropriate to recaii that Kant represented the facts correctiy
when he expected the growing influence of 'Money Power' would gradually diminish
warlike tendencies. ' It is the spirit of commerce, ' he says, 'which cannot exist side by
side with war. ' (Kant, Zum ewigen Frieden, Siimtliche Werke, Vo!. V, p. 688.) See

SOCIAL ORDER AND CONSTITUTION
democrat for themselves alone and who thus became contrasted
with liberals who did not go so far.
The significance of the democratic form of constitution is not that
it represents more nearly than any other the natural and inborn
rights of man ; not that it realizes, better than any other kind of
government, the ideas of liberty and equality. In the abstract it is as
little unworthy of a man to let others govern him as it is to let some­
one else perform any kind of labour for him. That the citizen of a
developed community feels free and happy in a democracy, that he
regards it as superior to all other forms of government, and that he
is prepared to make sacrifices to achieve and maintain it, this, again,
is not to be explained by the fact that democracy is worthy of love
for its own sake. The fact is that it performs functions which he is
not prepared to do without.
It is usually argued that the essential function of democracy is the
selection of political leaders. In the democratic system the appoint­
ment to at least the most important public offices is decided by com­
petition in all the publicity of political life, and in this competition,
it is believed, the most capable are bQund to win. But it is difficult
to see why democracy should necessarily be luckier than autocracy
or aristocracy in selecting people for directing the state. In non­
democratic states, history shows, political talents have frequently
won through, and one cannot maintain that democracy always puts
the best people into office. On this point the enemies and the friends
of democracy will never agree.
The truth is that the significance of the democratic form of con­
stitution is something quite different from all this. Its function is to
make peace, to avoid violent revolutions. In non-democratic states,
too, only a government which can count on the backing of public
opinion is able to maintain itself in the long run. The strength of all
governments lies not in weapons but in the spirit which puts the
weapons at their disposal. Those in power, always necessarily a small
minority against an enormous majority, can attain and maintain
power only by making the spirit of the majority pliant to their rule.
If there is a change, if those on whose support the government
depends lose the conviction that they must support this particular
government, then the ground is undermined beneath it and it must
sooner or later give way. Persons and systems in the government of
non-democratic states can be changed by violence alone. The system

72

SOC IAL FUNCTION OF D EMOCRACY
and the individuals that have lost the support of the people are
swept away in the upheaval and a new system and other individuals
take their place.
But any violent revolution costs blood and money. Lives are
sacrificed, and destruction impedes economic activity. Democracy
tries to prevent such material loss and the accompanying psychical
shock by guaranteeing accord between the will of the state - as
expressed through the organs of the state - and the will of the
majority. This it achieves by making the organs of the state legally
dependent on the will of the majority of the moment. In internal
policy it realizes what pacifism seeks to realize in external policy. l
That this alone is the decisive function of democracy becomes
clearly evident when we consider the argument which opponents of
the democratic principle most frequently adduce against it. The
Russian conservative is undoubtedly right when he points out that
Russian Tsarism and the policy of the Tsar ,,"'as approved by t..�e
great mass of the Russian people, so that even a democratic state
form could not have given Russia a different system of government.
Russian democrats themselves have had no delusions about this.
As long as the majority of the Russian people or, better, of that part
of the people which was politically mature and which had the oppor­
tunity to intervene in policy -. as long as this majority stood behind
tsardom, the empire did not suffer from the absence of a democratic
form of constitution. This lack became fatal, however, as soon as a
difference arose between public opinion and the political system of
tsardom. State will and people's will could not be adjusted paci­
fically; a political catastrophe was inevitable. And what is true of
the Russia of the Tsar is just as true of the Russia of the Bolshevists;
it is just as true of Prussia, of Germany, and of every other state.
How disastrous were the effects of the French Revolution, from which
France has psychically never quite recovered ! How enormously
England has benefited from the fact that she has been able to avoid
revolution since the seventeenth century !
Thus we see how mistaken it is to regard the terms democratic
and revolutionary as synonymous or even as similar. Democracy is
1 In some sense it is, perhaps, not altogether an accident that the writer who, at
the threshold of the Renaissance, first raised the democratic demand for legislation by
the people - Marsilius of Padua - called his work 'Defensor Pacis'. Atger, Essai sur

SOCIAL ORDER AND CONSTITUTION
not only not revolutionary, but it seeks to �xtirpate revolution. The
cult of revolution, of violent overthrow at any price, which is peculiar
to Marxism, has nothing whatever to do with democracy. Liberalism,
recognizing that the attainment of the economic aims of man pre­
supposes peace, and seeking therefore to eliminate all causes of strife
at home or in foreign politics, desires democracy. The violence of
war and revolutions is always an evil to liberal eyes, an evil which
cannot always be avoided as long as man lacks democracy. Yet even
when revolution seems almost inevitable Liberalism tries to save the
people from violence, hoping that philosophy may so enlighten
tyrants that they will voluntarily renounce rights which are opposed
to social development. Schiller speaks with the voice of Liberalism
when he makes the Marquis Posa implore the king for liberty of
thought; and the great night of August 4th, 1 789, when the French
feudal lords voluntarily renounced their privileges, and the English
Reform Act of 1 832, show that these hopes Were not quite vain.
Liberalism has no admiration to spare for the heroic grandiosity of
Marxism's professional revolutionaries, who stake the lives of thou­
sands and destroy values which the labour of decades and centuries
has created. Here the economic principle holds good : Liberalism
wants success at the smallest price.
Democracy is self-government of the people; it is autonomy. But
this does not mean that all must collaborate equally in legislation and
administration. Direct democracy can be realized only on the
smallest scale. Even small parliaments cannot do all their work in
plenary assemblies ; committees must be chosen, and the real work
is done by individuals; by the proposers, the speakers, the rappor­
teurs, and above all by the authors of the bills. Here then is final
proof of the fact that the masses follow the leadership of a few men.
That men are not all equal, that some are born to lead and some to
be led is a circumstance which even democratic institutions cannot
alter. We cannot all be pioneers : most people do not wish to be nor
have they the necessary strength. The idea that under the purest
form of democracy people would spend their days in council like the
members of a parliament derives from the conception we had of the
ancient Greek city State at its period of decay; but we overlook the
fact that such communities were not in fact democracies at all, since
they excluded from public life the slaves and all who did not possess
full citizen rights. Where all are to collaborate, the 'pure' ideal of

74

S O C IAL FUNC T I ON O F DEMOCRACY
direct democracy becomes impracticable. To want to see democracy
realized in this impossible form is nothing less than pedantic natural
law doctrinairianism. To achieve the ends for which democratic
institutions strive it is only necessary that legislation and administra­
tion shall be guided according to the will of the popular majority and
for this purpose indirect democracy is completely satisfactory. The
essence ofdemocracy is not that everyone makes and administers laws
but that lawgivers and rulers should be dependent on the people's
will in such a way that they may be peaceably changed ifconflict occurs.
This defeats many of the arguments, put forward by friends and
opponents of popular rule, against the possibility of realizing
democracy. l Democracy is not less democracy because leaders come
forth from the masses to devote themselves entirely to politics. Like
any other profession in the society dividing labour, politics demand
the entire man; dilettante politicians are of no use.· As long as the
professional politician remains dependent on the will of the majority,
so that he can carry out only that for which he has won over the
majority, the democratic principle is satisfied. Democracy does not
demand, either that parliament shall be a copy, on a reduced scale,
of the social stratification of the country, consisting, where peasant
and industrial labourers form the bulk of the population, mainly of
peasants and industrial labourers." The gentleman of leisure who
plays a great role in the English parliament, the lawyer and
j ournalist of the parliaments of the Latin countries probably represent
the people better than the trade union leaders and peasants who
have ' brought spiritual desolation to the German and Slav parlia­
ments. If members of the higher social ranks were excluded from
parliaments, those parliaments and the governments emanating
from them could not represent the will of the people. For in society

a The natural law theories of democracy, which fail to appreciate the essentials of
the division of labour, cling to the idea of the 'representation' of electors by elected.
It was not difficult to show how artificial was this concept. The member of parliament
who makes laws for me and controls for me the administration of the postal system, no
more 'represents' me than the doctor who heals me or the cobbler who makes shoes
for me. What differentiates him essentially from the doctor and the cobbler is not that
he fulfils services of a different kind for me but that if I am dissatisfied with him I
cannot withdraw the care of my affairs from him in the same simple way I can dismiss a
doctor or a cobbler. To get that influence in government which I have over my doctor
and shoemaker I want to be an elector.

75

SOCIAL ORDER AND CONSTITUTION
these higher ranks, the composition of which is itself the result of a
selection made by public opinion, exert on the minds of the people
an influence out of all proportion to their mere numbers. If one kept
them from parliament and public administration by describing them
to the electors as men unfit to rule, a conflict would have arisen
between public opinion and the opinion of parliamentary bodies,
and this would make more difficult, ifnot impossible, the functioning
of democratic institutions. Non-parliamentary influences make
themselves felt in legislation and administration, for the intellectual
power of the excluded cannot be stifled by the inferior elements
which lead in parliamentary life. Parliamentarism suffers from
nothing so much as from this ; we must seek here the reason for its
much deplored decline. For democracy is not mob-rule, and to do
justice to its tasks, parliament should include the best political minds
of the nation.
Grave injury has been done to the concept of democracy by those
who, exaggerating the natural law notion of sovereignty, conceived
it as limitless rule of the volontl generale. There is really no essen­
tial difference between the unlimited power of the democratic state
and the unlimited power of the autocrat. The idea that carries away
our demagogues and their supporters, the idea that the state can do
whatever it wishes, and that nothing should resist the will of the
sovereign people, has done more evil perhaps than the caesar-mania
of degenerate princelings. Both have the same origin in the notion
of a state based purely on political might. The legislator feels free
of all limitations because he understands from the theory of law that
all law depends on his will. It is a small confusion of ideas, but a
confusion with profound consequences, when he takes his formal
freedom to be a material one and believes himself to be above the
natural conditions of social life. The conflicts which arise out of this
misconception show that only within the framework of Liberalism
does democracy fulfil a social function. Democracy without Liberal­
ism is a hollow form.

The ideal of equali�
Political democracy necessarily follows from Liberalism. But it
often said that the democratic principle must eventually lead

THE

IDEAL

OF

beyond Liberalism. Carried out strictly, it is said, it will require
economic as well as political rights of equality. Thus logically
Socialism must necessarily evolve out of Liberalism, while Liberalism
necessarily involves its own destruction.
The ideal of equality, also, originated as a demand of natural
law. It was sought to justify it with religious, psychological, and
philosophical arguments; but all these proved to be untenable. The
fact is that men are endowed differently by nature; thus the demand
that all should be equally treated cannot rest on any theory that all
are equal. The poverty of the natural law argument is exposed most
clearly when it deals with the principle of equality.
If we wish to understand this principle we must start with an
historical examination. In modern times, as earlier, it has been
appealed to as a means of sweeping away the feudal differentiation
of individuals' legal rights. So long as barriers hinder the develop­
ment of the individual and of whole sections of the people, social life
is bound to be disturbed by violent upheavals. People without rights
are always a menace to social order. Their common interest in re­
moving such barriers unites them; they are prepared to resort to
violence because by peaceable means they are unable to get what they
want. Social peace is attained only when one allows all members of
society to participate in democratic institutions. And this means
equality of All before the Law.
Another consideration too urges upon Liberalism the desirability
of such equality. Society is best served when the means of production
are in the possession of those who know how to use them best. The
gradation of legal rights according to accident of birth keep produc­
tion goods from the best managers. We all know what role this argu­
ment has played in liberal struggles, above all in the emancipation of
the serfs. The soberest reasons of expediency recommend equality to
Liberalism. Liberalism is fully conscious, of course, that equality
before the Law can become extremely oppressive for the individual
under certain circumstances, because what benefits one may injure
another; the liberal idea of equality is however based on social
considerations, and where these are to be served the suscepti­
bilities of individuals must give way. Like all other social
institutions, the Law exists for social purposes. The individual must
bow to it, because his own aims can be served only in and with
society.
77

SOCIAL ORDER AND CONSTITUTION
The meaning of legal institutions is misunderstood when they are
conceived to be anything more than this, and when they are made the
basis of new claims which are to be realized at whatever cost to the
aim of social collaboration. The equality Liberalism creates is
equality before the Law; it has never sought any other. From the
liberal point of view, therefore, criticism which condemns this
equality as inadequate - maintaining that true equality is full
equality of income through equal distribution of commodities - is
unjustified.
But it is precisely in this form that the principle of equality is most
acclaimed by those who expect to gain more than they lose from an
equal distribution of goods. Here is a fertile field for the demagogue.
Whoever stirs up the resentment of the poor against the rich can count
on securing a big audience. Democracy creates the most favourable
preliminary conditions for the development of this spirit, which is
always and everywhere present, though concealed. 1 So far all
democratic states have foundered on this point. The democracy
of our own time is hastening towards the same end.
It is a strange fact that just that idea of equality should be called
unsocial which considers equality only from the point of view of the
interests of society as a whole, and which wants to see it achieved
only in so far as it helps society to attain its social aims; while the view
which insists that equality, regardless of the consequences, implies a
claim to an equal quota of the national income is put forward as the
only view inspired by consideration for society. In the Greek city
State of the fourth century the citizen considered himself lord of the
property of all the subjects of the State and he demanded his part
imperiously, as a shareholder demands his dividends. Referring to
the practice of distributing common property and confiscated private
property, Aeschines made the following comment: 'The Athenians
come out of the Ecclesia not as out of a political assembly but as from
the meeting of a company in which the surplus profit has been
distributed.'1 It cannot be denied that even to-day the common man
is inclined to look on the State as a source from which to draw the
utmost possible income.
But the principle of equaiity in this form by no means follows

necessarily from the democratic idea. It should not be recognized as
valid a priori any more than any other principle of social life. Before
one can judge it, its effects must be clearly understood. The fact that
it is generally very popular with the masses and therefore finds easy
recognition in a democratic state neither makes it a fundamental
principle of democracy nor protects it from the scrutiny of the
theorist.

Democracy and social-democracy
The view that democracy and Socialism are inwardly related
spread far and wide in the decades which preceded the Bolshevist
revolution. Many came to believe that democracy and Socialism
meant the same thing, and that democracy without Socialism or
Socialism without democracy would not be possible.
This notion sprang principally from a combination of two chains
of thought, both of which sprang originally from the Hegelian
philosophy of history. For Hegel world history is 'progress in the
consciousness of freedom'. Progress takes place in this way : ' . . . the
Orientals· only knew that one is free, the Greek and Roman world
that some are free, but we know that all men are free as such, that man
is free as man'. 1 There is no doubt that the freedom of which Hegel
spoke was different from that for which the radical politicians of his
day were fighting. Hegel took ideas which were common to the
political doctrines of the epoch of enlightenment and intellectualized
them. But the radical young Hegelians read into his words what
appealed to them. For them it was certain that the evolution to
Democracy was a necessity in the Hegelian sense of this term. The
historians follow suit. Gervinus sees 'by and large in the history of
humanity', as 'in the internal evolution of the states', 'a regular
progress . . . from the spiritual and civil freedom of the single
individual to that of the Several and the Many' "
The materialist conception of history provides the idea of the

SOCIAL ORDER AND CONSTITUTION
'liberty of the many' with a different content. The Many are the
proletarians ; they must necessarily become socialists because con­
sciousness is determined by the social conditions. Thus evolution to
democracy and evolution to Socialism are one and the same thing.
Democracy is the means towards the realization of Socialism, but
at the same time Socialism is the means towards the realization of
democracy. The party title, 'Social Democracy', most clearly
expresses this co-ordination of Socialism and d emocracy. With the
name democracy the socialist workers' party took over the spiritual
inheritance of the movements of Young Europe. All the slogans of
the pre-March 1 radicalism are to be found in the Social-Democratic
Party programmes. They recruit, for the party, supporters who feel
indifferent to or are even repulsed by the demands of Socialism.
The relation of Marxist Socialism to the demand for democracy
was determined by the fact that it was the Socialism of the Germans,
the Russians, and the smaller nations which lived under the Austro­
Hungarian monarchy and the empire of the Tsars. Every opposition
party in these more or less autocratic states had to demand democracy
first of all, so as to create the conditions that must precede the de­
velopment of political activity. For the social democrats this practi­
cally excluded democracy from discussion; it would never have done
to cast a doubt on the democratic ideology pro foro externa.
But the question of the relation between the two ideas 'expressed
in its double name could not be completely suppressed within the
party. People began by dividing the problem into two parts. When
they spoke of the coming socialist paradise they continued to main­
tain the interdependence of the terms and even went a little farther
and said that they were ultimately one. Since one continued to
regard democracy as in itself a good thing, one could not - as a
faithful socialist awaiting absolute salvation in the paradise-to-be ­
arrive at any other conclusion. There would be something wrong
with the land of promise if it were not the best imaginable from a
political point of view. Thus socialist writers did not cease to pro­
claim that only in a socialist society could true democracy exist.
What passed for democracy in the capitalist states was a caricature
designed to cover the machinations of exploiters.
But although it was seen that Socialism and democracy must
meet at the goal, nobody was quite certain whether they were to
1 i.e. Gennan radicalism before the revolution of 1848 (translator's note).
80

DEMO CRACY AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY
take the same road. People argued over the problem whether the
realization of Socialism - and therefore, according to the views just
discussed, of democracy too - was to be attempted through the
instrumentality of democracy or whether in the struggle one should
deviate from the principles of democracy. This was the celebrated
controversy about the dictatorship of the proletariat; it was the sub­
j ect of academic discussion in Marxist literature up to the time of
the Bolshevist revolution and has since become a great political
problem.
Like all other differences of opinion which divide Marxists into
groups, the quarrel arose from the dualism which cuts right through
that bundle of dogmas called the Marxist system. In Marxism there
are always two ways at least of looking at anything and everything,
and the reconciliation of these views is attained only by dialectic
artificialities. The commonest device is to use, according to the
needs of the moment, a word to which more than one meaning may
be attached. With these words, which at the same time serve as
political slogans to hypnotize the mass psyche, a cult suggestive of
fetishism is carried on. The Marxist dialectic is essentially word­
fetishism. Every article of the faith is embodied in a word fetish
whose double or even multiple meaning makes it possible to unite
incompatible ideas and demands. The interpretation of these words,
as intentionally ambiguous as the words of the Delphic Pythia,
eventually brings the different parties to blows, and everyone quotes
in his favour passages from the writings of Marx and Engels to which
authoritative importance is attached.
'Revolution' is one of these words. By 'industrial revolution'
Marxism means the gradual transformation of the pre-capitalist way
of production into the capitalist. 'Revolution' here means the same
as 'development', and the contrast between the terms 'evolution' and
'revolution' is almost extinguished. Thus the Marxist is able, when
it pleases him, to speak of the revolutionary spirit as contemptible
'putschism'. The revisionists were quite right when they called many
passages in Marx and Engels to their support. But when Marx calls
the workers' movement a revolutionary movement and says that the
working class is the only true revolutionary class, he is using the term
in the sense that suggests barricades and street fights. Thus syndical­
ism is also right when it appeals to Marx.
Marxism is equally obscure in the use of the word State. According

81

SOCIAL ORDER AND CONSTITUTION
to Marxism, the State is merely an instrument of class domination.
By acquiring political power the proletariat abolishes class conflict
and the State ceases to exist. 'As soon as there is no longer any social
class to be kept in suppression, and as soon as class domination and
the struggle for individual existence based on the hitherto existing
anarchy of production are removed, along with the conflicts and
excesses which arise from them, then there will be nothing more to
repress and nothing that would make necessary a special repressive
power, a state. The first act in which the State really appears as
representative of the whole society - the taking possession of the
means of production in the name of society - is simultaneously its
last independent act as a state. The intervention of state power in
social affairs becomes superfluous in one field after another until at
last it falls asleep of its own accord .' 1 However obscure or badly
thought out may be its view of the essence of political organization,
this statement is so positive in what it says of the proletarian rule that
it would seem to leave no room for doubt. But it seems much less
positive when we remember Marx's assertion that between the
capitalist and the communist societies must lie a period of revolu­
tionary transformation, in addition to which there will be a corre­
sponding 'political period of transition whose state can be no other
than the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat' . 9 If we assume,
with Lenin, that this period is to endure until that 'higher phase of
communist society' is reached, in which 'the enslaving subordination
of individuals under the division of labour has vanished, and with it
the contrast of mental and physical work', in which 'work will have
become not only a means to life but itself the first necessity of life',
then of course we come to a very different conclusion with regard
to Marxism's attitude to democracy.8
Obviously the socialist
community will have no room for democracy for centuries to
come.
Although it occasionally comments on the historical achievements
of Liberalism, Marxism entirely overlooks the importance of liberal
ideas. It is at a loss when it comes to deal with the liberal demands
for liberty of conscience and expression of opinion, for the recognition

D E M O C RACY AND S O C IAL-DE MOCRACY
on principle of every opposition party and the equal rights of all
parties. Wherever it is not in power, Marxism claims all the basic
liberal rights, for they alone can give it the freedom which its pro­
paganda urgently needs. But it can never understand their spirit
and will never grant them to its opponents when it comes into power
itself. In this respect it resembles the Churches and other institutions
which rest on the principle of violence. These, too, exploit the demo­
cratic liberties when they are fighting their battle, but once in power
they deny their adversaries such rights. So, plainly, the democracy
of Socialism exposes its deceit. 'The party of the communists', says
Bucharin, 'demands no sort of liberties for the bourgeois enemies of
the people. On the contrary. ' And with remarkable cynicism he
boasts that the communists, before they were in power, advocated the
liberty of expression of opinion merely because it would have been
'ridiculous' to demand from the capitalists liberty for the workers'
movement in any other way than by demanding liberty in
general. 1
Always and everywhere Liberalism demands democracy at once,
for it believes that the function which it has to fulfil in society permits
of no postponement. Without democracy the peaceful development
of the state is impossible. The demand for democracy is not the
resuit of a policy of compromise or of a pandering to relativism in
questions of world-philosophy, 2 for Liberalism asserts the absolute
validity of its doctrine. Rather, it is the consequence of the Liberal
belief that power depends upon a mastery over mind alone and that
to gain such a mastery only spiritual weapons are effective. Even
where for an indefinite time to come it may expect to reap only dis­
advantages from democracy, Liberalism still advocates democracy.
Liberalism believes that it cannot maintain itself against the will of
the majority; and that in any case the advantages which might
accrue from a liberal regime maintained artificially and against the
feeling of the people would be infinitesimal compared to the disturb­
ances that would stay the quiet course of state development if the
people's will were violated.

The political constitution of socialist communities
Beyond the dictatorship of the proletariat lies the paradise, the
'higher phase of the communist society' , in which, 'with the all round
development of individuals, the productive forces will also have
increased, and all the springs of social wealth will flow more
freely' . 1 In this land of promise 'there will remain nothing to repress,
nothing which would nec.essitate a special repressive power, a state
. . . in piace of the government over persons comes the administra­
tion of things and the direction of productive processes'.1 An epoch
will have begun in which 'a generation, grown up in new, free social
conditions, will be able to discard the whole lumber of State'.8 The
working class will have gone, thanks to 'long struggles, a whole series
of historical processes', by which 'the men, like the conditions, were
completely transformed'.' Thus society is able to exist without co­
ercion, as once it did in the Golden Age. Of this Engels has much
to relate, much that is beautiful and good.· Only we have read it all
before, all better and more beautifully expressed in Virgil, Ovid,
and Tacitus !

Aurea prima sata est aetas, quae vindice nullo,
sponte sua, sine lege fidem rectumque colebat.
Poena metusque aberant, nec verba minantia fixo
aere legebantur.'
It follows from all this that the Marxists have no occasion to occupy
themselves with problems concerned with the political constitution

of the socialist community. In this connection they perceive no
problems at all which cannot be dismissed by saying nothing about
them. Yet even in the socialist community the necessity of acting in
common must raise the question of how to act in common. It will
be necessary to decide how to form that which is usually called,
metaphorically, the will of the community or the will of the people.
Even if we overlooked the fact that there can be no administration
of goods which is not administration of men - i.e. the bending of one
human will to another - and no direction of productive processes
which is not the government over persons - i.e. domination of one
human will by another 1 - even if we overlooked this we should still
have to ask who is to administer the goods and direct the productive
processes, and on what principles. Thus, once again we are beset
by all the political problems of the legally regulated social
community.
All historical attempts to realize the socialist ideal of society have
a most pronounced authoritarian character. Nothing in the Empire
of the Pharaohs or of the Incas, and nothing in the Jesuit State of
Paraguay was suggestive of democracy, of self-determination by the
majority of the people. The Utopias of all the older kinds of socialists
were equally undemocratic. Neither Plato nor St. Simon were demo­
crats. One finds nothing in history or in the literary history of
socialist theory which shows an internal connection between the
socialist order of. society and political democracy.
If we look closer we find that the ideal of the higher phase of
communist society, ripening only in remote distances of the future,
is, as the Marxists view it, thoroughly undemocratic. 2 Here, too, the
socialist intends that eternal peace shall reign - the goal of all demo­
cratic institutions. But the means by which this peace is to be
gained are very different from those employed by the democrats.
It will not rest on the power to change peacefully rulers and ruling
policy, but on the fact that the regime is made permanent, and that
rulers and policy are unchangeable. This, too, is peace; not the
peace of progress which Liberalism strives to attain but the peace of
the graveyard. It is not the peace of pacifists but of pacifiers, of men

of violence who seek to create peace by subjection. Every absoluti!!t
makes such peace by setting up an absolute domination, and it lasts
just as long as his domination can be maintained. Liberalism sees
the vanity of all this. It sets itself, therefore, to make a peace which
will be proof against the perils which threaten it on account of man's
inextinguishable yearning for change.

I V

THE SO CIAL ORDER AND THE FAMILY

§I
Socialism and the sexual problem

ROPOSALS to transform the relations between the sexes have
Plong gone hand in hand with plans for the socialization of the
means of production. Marriage is to disappear along with private
property, giving place to an arrangement more in harmony with the
fundamental facts of sex. When man is liberated from the yoke of
economic labour, love is to be liberated from an the economic
trammels which have profaned it. Socialism promises not only wel­
fare - wealth for all - but universal happiness,in love as well. This
part of its programme has been the source of much of its popularity.
It is significant that no other German socialist book was more widely
read or more effective as propaganda than Bebel's Woman and
Socialism, which is dedicated above all to the message of free love.
It is not strange that many should feel the system of regulating
sexual relations under which we live to be unsatisfactory. This
system exerts a far reaching influence in diverting those sexual
energies, which are at the bottom of so much human activity, from
their purely sexual aspect to new purposes which cultural develop­
ment has evolved. Great sacrifices have been made to build up this
system and new sacrifices are always being made. There is a process
which every individual must pass through in his own life if his sexual
energies are to cast off the diffuse form they have in childhood and
take their final mature shape. He must develop the inner psychic
strength which impedes the flow of undifferentiated sexual energy
and like a dam alters its direction.
A part of the energy with which nature has endowed the sexual
instinct is in this way turned from sexual to other purposes. Not
everyone escapes unscathed from the stress and struggle of this
change. Many succumb, many become neurotic or insane. Even the
man who remains healthy and becomes a useful member of society
87

THE SOCIAL ORDER AND THE FAMILY
is left with scars which an unfortunate accident may re-open. 1 And
even though sex should become the source of his greatest happiness,
it will also be the source of his deepest pain; its passing will tell him
that age has come, and that he is doomed to go the way of all tran­
sient, earthly things. Thus sex, which seems ever and again to fool
man by giving and denying, first making him happy and then plung­
ing him back into misery, never lets him sink into inertia. Waking
and dreaming man's wishes turn upon sex. Those who sought to
reform society could not have overlooked it.
This was the more to be expected since many of them were them­
selves neurotics suffering from an unhappy development of the
sexual instinct. Fourier, for example, suffered from a grave psy­
chosis. The sickness of a man whose sexual life is in the greatest
disorder is evident in every line of his writings; it is a pity that nobody
has undertaken to examine his life history by the psycho-analytic
method. That the crazy absurdities of his books shouid have circu­
lated so widely and won the highest commendation is due entirely
to the fact that they describe with morbid fantasy the erotic pleasures
awaiting humanity in the paradise of the 'phalanstere'.
Utopianism presents all its ideals for the future as the reconstruc­
tion of a Golden Age which humanity has lost through its own fault.
In the same way it pretends that it is demanding for sexual life only
a return to an original felicity. The poets of antiquity are no less
eloquent in their praises of marvellous, bygone times of free love
than when they speak of the saturnian ages when property did not
exist.- Marxism echoes the older Utopians.
Marxism indeed seeks to combat marriage just as it seeks to
justify the abolition of private property, by attempting to demon­
strate its origin in history; just as it looked for reasons for abolishing
the State in the fact that the State had not existed 'from eternity',
that societies had lived without a vestige of 'State and State power' ..
For the Marxist, historical research is merely a means of political
agitation. Its use is to furnish him with weapons against the hateful
bourgeois order of society. The main objection to this method is
not that it puts forward frivolous, untenable theories without

thoroughly examining the historical material, but that he smuggles
an evaluation of this material into an exposition which pretends to
be scientific. Once upon a time, he says, there was a golden age.
Then came one which was worse, but supportable. Finally, Capital­
ism arrived, and with it every imaginable evil. Thus Capitalism is
damned in advance. It can be granted only a single merit, that
thanks to the excess of its abominations, the world is ripe for salvation
by Socialism.

§2
Man and woman in the age of violence
Recent ethnographical and historical research has provided a
wealth of material on which to base a judgment of the history of
sexual relations, and the new science of psycho-analysis has laid the
foundations for a scientific theory of sexual life. So far sociology has
not begun to understand the wealth of ideas and material available
from these sources. It has not been able to restate the problems in
such a way that they are adjusted to the questions that should be its
first study to-day. What it says about exogamy and endogamy,
about promiscuity, not to mention matriarchy and patriarchy, is
quite out of touch with the theories one is now entitled to put for­
ward. In fact, sociological knowledge of the earliest history of
marriage and the family is so defective that one cannot draw on it
for an interpretation of the problems which occupy us here. It is on
fairly secure ground where it is dealing with conditions in historical
times but nowhere else.
Unlimited rule of the male characterizes family relations where
the principle of violence dominates. Male aggressiveness, which is
implicit in the very nature of sexual relations, is here carried to the
extreme. The man seizes possession of the woman and holds this
sexual object in the same sense in which he has other goods of the
outer world. Here woman becomes completely a thing. She is
stolen and bought; she is given away, sold away, ordered away; in
short, she is like a slave in the house. During life the man is her
judge; when he dies she is buried in his grave aiong with his other
possessions. 1 With almost absolute unanimity the older legal sources

THE S O C I A L ORDER AND THE FAM I L Y
of almost every nation show that this was once the lawful state of
affairs. Historians usually try, especially when dealing with the
history of their own nations, to soften the painful impression which a
description of these conditions leaves on a modern mind. They point
out that practice · was milder than the letter of the law, that the
harshness of the law did not cloud the relations between the married
couple. For the rest, they get away as quickly as possible from a
subject which does not seem to fit too well into their system, by
dropping a few remarks about the ancient severity of morals and
purity of family life. 1 But these attempts at justification, to which
their nationalist point of view and a predilection for the past seduce
them, are distorted. The conception afforded by the old laws and
law books of the relations between man and woman is not a theoreti­
cal speculation of unworldly dreamers. It is a picture direct from
life and reproduces exactly what men, and women too, believed of
marriage and intercourse between the sexes. That a Roman woman
who stood in the 'manus' of the husband or under the guardianship
of the clan, or an ancient German woman who remained subject to
the 'munt' all her life, found this relation quite natural and just, that
they did not revolt against it inwardly, or make any attempt to shake
off the yoke - this does not prove that a broad chasm had developed
between law and practice. It only shows that the institution suited
the feeling of women; and this should not surprise us. The prevailing
legal and moral views of a time are held not only by those whom they
benefit but by those, too, who appear to suffer from them. Their
domination is expressed in that fact - that the people from whom
they claim sacrifices also accept them. Under the princil'le of
violence, woman is the servant of man. In this she too sees her
destiny. She shares the attitude to which the New Testament has
given the most terse expression :
Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for
the man!
The principle of violence recognizes only the male. He alone
possesses power, hence he alone has rights. Woman is merely a sexuai
object. No woman is without a lord, be it father or guardian, husband

or employer. Even the prostitutes are not free; they belong to
the owner of the brothel. The guests make their contracts, not with
them, but with him. The vagabond woman is free game, whom
everyone may use according to his pleasure. The right to choose a
man herself does not belong to the woman. She is given to the hus­
band and taken by him. That she loves him is her duty, perhaps also
her virtue; the sentiment will sharpen the pleasure which a man
derives from marriage. But the woman is not asked for her opinion.
The man has the right to repudiate or divorce her; she herself has
no such right.
Thus in the age of violence, belief in man's lordship triumphs
over all older tendencies to evolve equal rights between the sexes.
Legend preserves a few traces of a time when woman enjoyed a
greater sexual freedom - the character of BIiinhilde, for example but these are no longer understood. But the dominion of man is so
great that it has come into conflict with the nature of sexual inter­
course and for sheer sexual reasons man must, in his own interest,
eventually weaken this dominion.
For it is against nature that man should take woman as a will-less
thing. The sexual act is a mutual give and take, and a merely suffer­
ing attitude in the woman diminishes man's pleasure. To satisfY
himself he must awaken her response. The victor who has dragged
the slave into his marriage bed, the buyer who has traded the
daughter from her father must court for that which the violation of
the resisting woman cannot give. The man who outwardly appears
the unlimited master of his woman is not so powerful in the house as
he thinks; he must concede a part of his rule to the woman, even
though he ashamedly conceals this from the world.
To this is added a second factor. The sexual act gradually be­
comes an extraordinary psychic effort which succeeds only with the
assistance of special stimuli. This becomes more and more so in
proportion as the individual is compelled by the principle of violence,
which makes all women owned women and thus renders more diffi­
cult sexual intercourse, to restrain his impulses and to control his
natural appetites. The sexual act now requires a special psychic
attitude to the sexual object. This is love, unknown to primitive man
and to the man of violence, who use every opportunity to possess,
without selection. The characteristic of love, the overvaluation of
the object, cannot exist when women occupy the position of
91

THE SOCIAL ORDER AND THE FAMILY
contempt which they occupy under the principle of violence. For
under this system she is merely a slave, but it is the nature of
love to conceive her as a queen.
Out of this contrast arises the first great conflict in the relations
ofthe sexes which we can perceive in the full light ofhistory. Marriage
and love become contradictory. The forms in which this contrast
appears vary, but in essence it always remains the same. Love has
entered the feelings and thoughts of men and woman and becomes
ever more and more the central point of psychic life, giving meaning
and charm to existence. But at first it has nothing to do with
marriage and the relations between husband and wife. This in­
evitably leads to grave conflicts, conflicts which are indeed revealed
to us in the epic and lyric poetry of the age of chivalry. These co�­
flicts are familiar to us because they are immortalized in imperishable
works of art and because they are still treated by epigons and by that
art which takes its themes from such primitive conditions as persist
at the present day. But we moderns cannot grasp the essence of the
conflict. We cannot understand what is to prevent a solution which
would satisfy all parties, why the lovers must remain separated and
tied to those they do not love. Where love finds love, where man
and woman desire nothing except to be allowed to remain for ever
devoted to each other, there, according to our view of the matter
everything should be quite simple. The kind of poetry which deals
with no other situation than this can, under the circumstances of
present day life, do nothing less than bring Hansel and Gretel into
each other's arms, a denouement which is no doubt calculated to
delight the readers of novels, but which is productive of no tragic
conflict.
If, without knowledge of the literature of the age of chivalry, and
basing our judgment merely on information about the relations of
the sexes derived from other sources, we tried to picture for ourselves
the psychic conflict of chivalric gallantry, we should probably
imagine a situation in which a man is torn between two women: one
his wife, to whom is bound the fate of his children; the other the lady
to whom belongs his heart. Or we should delineate the position of a
wife neglected by her husband, who loves another. Yet nothing would
lie farther from an age dominated by the principle of violence. The
Greek who divided his time between the hetaeras and love-boys by no
means felt that his relationship with his wife was a psychic burden,
92

MAN IN THE AGE OF VI OLENCE
and she herself did not see in the love given to the, courtesan any
encroachment on her own rights. Neither the troubadour who de­
voted himself wholly to the lady of his heart nor his wife who waited
patiently at home suffered under the conflict between love and
marriage. Both Ulrich von Liechtenstein and his good housewife
found the chivalrous 'minnedienst' just as it should be. In fact, the
conflict in chivalrous love was of an altogether different nature.
When the wife granted the utmost favours to another the rights of
the husband were injured. However eagerly he himself set out to win
the favours of other women, he would not tolerate interference in his
property rights, he would not hear of anyone possessing his woman.
This is a conflict based on the principles of violence. The husband
is offended, not because the love of his wife is directed away from him,
but because her body, which he owns, is to belong to others. Where,
as so often in antiquity and the orient, the love of man sought not the
wives of others but prostitutes, femaie siaves, and iove-boys, aii
standing outside society, a conflict could not arise. Love forces the
conflict only from the side of male jealousy. The man alone, as
owner of his wife, can claim to possess completely. The wife has
not the same right over her husband. In the essentially different
judgment bestowed upon the adultery of a man and the adultery
of a woman and in the different manner in which husband
and wife regard the adultery of one another, we see to-day the
remnants of that code, which is otherwise already incomprehensible
to us.
Under such circumstances, as long as the principle of violence
rules, the impulse to love is denied an opportunity to develop.
Banished from the homely hearth it seeks out all manner of hiding
places, where it assumes queer forms . Libertinage grows rampant,
perversions of the natural instincts become more and more common.
Conditions are conducive to the spread ofvenereal diseases. Whether
syphilis was indigenous to Europe or whether it was introduced after
the discovery of America is a questionable point. Whatever the
truth, we know that it began to ravage Europe like an epidemic
about the beginning of the sixteenth century. With the misery it
brought the love pll'!-Y of chivalric romanticism was at an end.

THE SOCIAL ORDER AND THE FAMILY

§3
Marriage under the influence of the idea of contract
Nowadays only one opinion is expressed about the influence
which the 'economic' has exercised on sexual relations; it is said to
have been thoroughly bad. The original natural purity of sexual
intercourse has, according to this view, been tainted by the inter­
ference of economic factors. In no field of human life has the pro­
gress of culture and the increase of wealth had a more pernicious
effect. Prehistoric men and women paired in purest love; in the pre­
capitalist age, marriage and family life were simple and natural, but
Capitalism brought money marriages and mariages de convenances
on the one hand, prostitution and sexual excesses on the other.
More recent historical and ethnographic research has demonstrated
the fallacy of this argument and has given us another view of sexual
life in primitive times and of primitive races. Modern literature has
revealed how far from the realities of rural life was our conception,
even only a short while ago, of the simple morals of the countryman.
But the old prejudices were too deep-rooted to have been seriously
shaken by this. Besides, socialistic literature, with the assistance of
its peculiarly impressive rhetoric, sought to popularize the legend by
giving it a new pathos. Thus to-day few people do not believe that
the modern view of marriage as a contract is an insult to the essential
spirit of sexual union and that it was Capitalism which destroyed the
purity of family life.
For the scientist it is difficult to know what attitude he should take
to a method of treating such problems which is founded on high­
minded sentiments rather than on a discernment of the facts.
What is Good, Noble, Moral, and Virtuous the scientist as such
is not able to jUdge. But he must at least correct the accepted view
on one important point. The ideal of sexual relations of our age is
utterly different from that of early times, and no age has come nearer
to attaining its ideal than ours. The sexual relations of the good old
times seem thoroughly unsatisfactory when measured by this, our,
ideal; therefore, this ideal must have arisen from just that evolution
which is condemned by the current theory as being responsible for
the fact that we have failed to attain our ideal completely. Hence it
is clear that the prevailing doctrine does not represent the facts; that,
94

MARRIAGE AND CONT RACT
indeed, it turns the facts upside down and is entirely valueless in an
attempt to understand the problem.
Where the principle of violence dominates, polygamy is universal.
Each man has as many wives as he can defend. Wives are a form of
property, of which it is always better to have more than few. A man
endeavours to own more wives, just as he endeavours to own more
slaves or cows; his moral attitude is the same, in fact, for slaves, cows,
and wives. He demands fidelity from his wife; he alone may dispose
of her labour and her body, himself remaining free of any ties what­
ever. Fidelity in the male implies monogamy. 1 A more powerful
lord has the right to dispose also of the wives of his subjects.' The
much discussed Jus Primae Noctis was an echo of these conditions,
of which a final development was the intercourse between father-in­
law and daughter-in-law in the 'joint-family' of the Southern Slavs.
Moral reformers did not abolish polygamy, neither did the
Church at first combat it. For centuries Christianity raised no objec­
tions to the polygamy of the barbarian kings. Charlemagne kept
many concubines.' By its nature polygamy was never an institution
for the poor man; the wealthy and the aristocratic could alone enjoy
it.' But with the latter it became increasingly complex according to
the extent to which women entered marriage as heiresses and owners,
were provided with rich dowries, and were endowed with greater
rights in disposing of the dowry. Thus monogamy has been gradually
enforced by the wife who brings her husband wealth and by her rela­
tives - a direct manifestation of the way in which capitalist thought
and calculation has penetrated the family. In order to prote.ct
legally the property of wives and their children a sharp line is drawn
between legitimate and illegitimate connection and succession. The
relation of husband and wife is acknowledged as a contract.'
As the idea of contract enters the Law of Marriage, it breaks the
rule of the male, and makes the wife a partner with equal rights.
From a one-sided relationship resting on force, marriage thus becomes
a mutual agreement; the servant becomes the married wife entitled

to demand from the man all that he is entitled to ask from her. Step
by step she wins the position in the home which she holds to-day.
Nowadays the position of the woman differs from the position of the
man only in so far as their peculiar ways of earning a living differ.
The remnants of man's privileges have little importance. They are
privileges of honour. The wife, for instance, still bears her husband's
name.
This evolution of marriage has taken place by way of the law
relating to the property of married persons. Woman's position in
marriage was improved as the principle of violence was thrust back,
and as the idea of contract advanced in other fields of the Law of

Property it necessarily transformed the property relations between
the married couple. The wife was freed from the power of her
husband for the first time when she gained legal rights over the
wealth which she brought into marriage and which she acquired
during marriage, and when that which her husband customarily
gave her was transformed into allowances enforceable by law.
Thus marriage, as we know it, has come into existence entirely as
a result of the contractual idea penetrating into this sphere of life.
All our cherished ideals of marriage have grown out of this idea.
That marriage unites one man and one woman, that it can be entered
into only with the free will of both parties, that it imposes a duty of
mutual fidelity, that a man's violations of the marriage vows are to
be judged no differently from a woman's, that the rights of husband
and wife are essentially the same - these principles develop from the
contractual attitude to the problem of marital life. No people can
boast that their ancestors thought of marriage as we think ofit to-day.
Science cannot judge whether morals were once more severe · than
they are now. We can establish only that our views of what marriage
should be are different from the views of past generations and that
their ideal of marriage seems immoral in our eyes.
When panegyrists of the good old morality execrate the institution
of divorce and separation they are probably right in asserting that

no such things existed formerly. The right to cast off his wife which

man once possessed in no way resembles the modern law of divorce.
Nothing illustrates more clearly the great change of attitude than the
contrast between these two institutions. And when the Church takes
the lead in the struggle against divorce, it is well to remember that
the existence of the modern marriage ideal of monogamy - of
96

THE PROBLEMS OF MARRIED LIFE
husband and wife with equal rights - in the defence of which the
Church wishes to intervene, is the result of capitalist, and not
ecclesiastical, development.

§4
The problems of married life
In the modern contractual marriage, which takes place at the
desire of husband and wife, marriage and love are united. Marriage
appears morally justified only when it is concluded for love; without
love between the bridal couple it seems improper. We find strange
those royal weddings which are arranged at a distance, and in which,
as in most of the thinking and acting of the ruling Houses, the age
of violence is echoed. The fact that they find it necessary to represent
these marriages to the public as love marriages shows that even
royal families have not been able to escape the bourgeois marriage
ideal.
The conflicts of modern married life spring first of all from the
necessarily limited duration of passion in a contract concluded for
life. 'Die Leidenschaft flieht, die Liebe muss bleiben' (Passion flies,
love must remain) , says Schiller, the poet of bourgeois married life.
In most marriages blessed with children, married love fades slowly
and unnoticeably; in its place develops a friendly affection which for
a long time is interrupted ever and again by a brief flickering of the
old love; living together becomes habitual, and in the children, in
whose development they relive their youth, the parents find consola­
tion for the renunciation they have been forced to make as old age
deprives them of their strength.
But this is not so for all. There are many ways by which man
may reconcile himself to the transience of the earthly pilgrimage.
To the believer religion brings consolation and courage; it enables
him to see himself as a thread in the fabric of eternal life, it assigns
to him a place in the imperishable plan of a world creator, and places
him beyond time and space, old age and death, high in the celestial
pastures. Others find satisfaction in philosophy. They refuse to
believe in a beneficent providence, the idea of which conflicts with
experience; they disdain the easy solace to be derived from an
arbitrary structure of fantasies, from an imaginary scheme designed
to create the illusion of a world order different from the order they
97

THE SOCIAL ORDER AND THE FAMILY
are forced to recognize around them. But the great mass of men
takes another way. Dully and apathetically they succumb to every­
day life; they never think beyond the moment, but become slaves of
habit and the passions. Between these, however, is a fourth group,
consisting of men who do not know where or how to find peace.
Such people can no longer believe because they have eaten of the
tree of knowledge; , they cannot smother their rebellious hearts in
apathy; they are too restless and too unbalanced to make the philo­
sophic adjustment to realities. At any price they want to win and
hold happiness. With all their might they strain at the bars which
imprison their instincts. They will not acquiesce. They want the
impossible, seeking happiness not in the striving but in the fulfilment,
not in the battle but in victory.
Such natures cannot tolerate marriage when the wild fire of the
first love has begun to die. They make the highest demands upon
love itself and they exaggerate the overvaluation of the sexual object.
Thus they are doomed, if only for physiological reasons, to experience
sooner than more moderate people disappointment in the intimate
life of marriage. And this disappointment can easily change to re­
vulsion. Love turns to hate, life with the once beloved becomes a
torment. He who cannot content himself, who is unwilling to
moderate the illusions with which he entered a marriage oflove, who
does not learn to transfer to his children, in sublimated form, those
desires which marriage can no longer satisfy - that man is not made
for marriage. He will break away from the bonds with new projects
of happiness in love, again and again repeating the old experience.
But all this has nothing to do with social conditions. These
marriages are not wrecked because the married couple live in the
capitalist order of society and because the means of production are
privately owned. The disease germinates not without, but within;
it grows out of the natural disposition of the parties concerned. It is
fallacious to argue that because such conflicts were lacking in pre­
capitalist society, wedlock must then have provided what is deficient
in these sick marriages. The truth is that love and marriage were
separate and people did not expect marriage to give them lasting and
unclouded happiness. Only when the idea of contract and consent
has been imposed on marriage does the wedded couple demand that
their union shall satisfy desire permanently. This is a demand which
love cannot possibly meet. The happiness of love is in the contest
98

THE PR O B L E M S O F MA R R I ED L I F E
for the favours of the loved one and in fulfilment of the longing to be
united with her. We need not discuss whether such happiness can
endure when physiological satisfaction is denied. But we know for
certain that desire gratified, cools sooner or later and that endeavours
to make permanent the fugitive hours of romance would be vain.
We cannot blame marriage because it is unable to change our earthly
life into an infinite series of ecstatic moments, all radiant with the
pleasures of love. We should be equally wrong to blame the social
environment.
The conflicts which social conditions cause in married life are of
minor importance. It would be wrong to assume that loveless mar­
riages made for the dowry of the wife or the wealth of the husband,
or that marriages made miserable by economic factors are in any
way as important an aspect of the question as the frequency with
which literature treats of them would suggest. There is always an
easy way out if people ,,\Till only look for it.
As a social institution marriage is an adjustment of the individual
to the social order by which a certain field of activity, with all its
tasks and requirements, is assigned to him. Exceptional natures,
whose abilities lift them far above the average, cannot support the
coercion which such an adjustment to the way of life of the masses
must involve. The man who feels within himself the urge to devise
and achieve great things, who is prepared to sacrifice his life rather
than be false to his mission, will not stifle his urge for the sake of a
wife and children. In the life of a genius, however loving, the woman
and whatever goes with her occupy a small place. We do not speak
here of those great men in whom sex was completely sublimated and
turned into other channels - Kant, for example - or of those whose
fiery spirit, insatiable in the pursuit of love, could not acquiesce in
the inevitable disappointments of married life and hurried with rest­
less urge from one passion to another. Even the man of genius whose
married life seems to take a normal course, whose attitude to sex
does not differ from that of other people, cannot in the long run feel
himself bound by marriage without violating his own self. Genius
does not allow itself to be hindered by any consideration for the com­
fort of its fellows - even of those closest to it. The ties of marriage
become intolerable bonds which the genius tries to cast off or at
least to loosen so as to be able to move freely. The married couple
must walk side by side amid the rank and file of humanity. Whoever
99

THE SOCIAL ORDER AND THE FAMILY
wishes to go his own way must break away from it. Rarely indeed is
he granted the happiness of finding a woman willing and able to go
with him on his solitary path.
All this was recognized long ago. The masses had accepted it so
completely that anyone who betrayed his wife felt himself entitled
to justify his action in these terms. But the genius is rare and a social
institution does not become impossible merely because one or two
exceptional men are unable to adjust themselves to it. No danger
threatened marriage from this side.
The attacks launched against it by the Feminism of the Nineteenth
Century seemed much more serious. Its spokesmen claimed that
marriage forced women to sacrifice personality. It gave man space
enough to develop his abilities, but to woman it denied all freedom.
This was imputed to the unchangeable nature of marriage, which
harnesses husband and wife together and thus debases the weaker
woman to be the servant of the man. No reform could alter this;
abolition of the whole institution alone could remedy the evil.
Women must fight for liberation from this yoke, not only that she
might be free to satisfy her sexual desires but so as to develop her
individuality. Loose relations which gave freedom to both parties
must replace marriage.
The radical wing of Feminism, which holds firmly to this stand­
point, overlooks the fact that the expansion of woman's powers and
abilities is inhibited not by marriage, not by being bound to man,
children, and household, but by the more absorbing form in which
the sexual function affects the female body. Pregnancy and the
nursing of children claim the best years of a woman's life, the years
in which a man may spend his energies in great achievements. One
may believe that the unequal distribution of the burden of reproduc­
tion is an injustice of nature, or that it is unworthy of woman to be
child-bearer and nurse, but to believe this does not alter the fact. It
may be that a woman is able to choose between renouncing either
the most profound womanly joy, the joy of motherhood, or the more
masculine development of her personality in action and endeavour.
It may be that she has no such choice. It may be that in sup­
pressing her urge towards motherhood she does hereself an injury
that reacts through all other functions of her being. But whatever
the truth about this, the fact remains that when she becomes a mother,
with or without marriage, she is prevented from leading her life as
1 00

FREE LOVE
freely and independently as man. Extraordinarily gifted women may
achieve fine things in spite vf motherhood; but because the functions
of sex have the first claim upon woman, genius and the greatest
achievements have been denied her.
So far as Feminism seeks to adjust the legal position of woman to
that of man, so far as it seeks to offer her legal and economic freedom
to develop and act in accordance with her inclinations, desires, and
economic circumstances - so far it is nothing more than a branch
of the great liberal movement, which advocates peaceful and free
evolution. When, going beyond this, it attacks the institutions of
social life under the impression that it will thus be able to remove the
natural barriers, it is a spiritual child of Socialism. For it is a
characteristic of Socialism to discover in social institutions the origin
of unalterable facts of nature, and to endeavour, by reforming these
institutions, to reform nature.

§s
Free love
Free love is the socialist's radical solution for sexual problems.
The socialistic society abolishes the economic dependence of woman
which results from the fact that woman is dependent on the income
of her husband. Man and woman have the same economic rights
and the same duties, as far as motherhood does not demand special
consideration for the woman. Public funds provide for the main­
tenance and education of the children, which are no longer the affairs
of the parents but of society. Thus the relations between the sexes
are no longer influenced by social and economic conditions. Mating
ceases to found the simplest form of social union, marriage and the
family. The family disappears and society is confronted with separate
individuals only. Choice in love becomes completely free. Men and
women unite and separate just as their desires urge. Socialism desires
to create nothing that is new in all this, but 'would only recreate on
a higher level of culture and under new social forms what was
universally valid on a more primitive cultural level and before private
ownership dominated society' . 1

THE SOCIAL ORDER AND THE FAM ILY
The arguments, sometimes unctuous and sometimes venomous,
which are put forward by theologians and other moral teachers, are
entirely inadequate as a reply to this programme. And most of the
writers who have occupied themselves with the problems of sexual
intercourse have been dominated by the monastic and ascetic ideas
of the moral theologians. To them the sexual instinct is the absolute
evil, sensuality is sin, voluptuousness is a gift of the devil, and even
the thought Qf such things is immoral. Whether or not we uphold
this condemnation of the sexual instinct depends entirely on our
inclination and scale of values. The moralist's endeavour to attack
or defend it from the scientific point of view is wasted labour. The
limits of scientific method are misconceived when one attributes to
it the role ofjudge and valuer; the nature of scientific method is mis­
understood when it is expected to influence action not merely by
showing the effectiveness of means to ends but also by determining
the relative value of the ends themselves. The scientist treating
ethical problems should, however, point out that we cannot begin
by rejecting the sexual instinct as evil in itself and then go on to give,
under certain conditions, our moral approval or toleration to the
sexual act. The usual dictum condemning sens'ual pleasure in sexual
intercourse but declaring nevertheless that the dutiful fulfilment of
the debitum conjugale for the purpose of begetting successors is
quite moral, springs from poverty-stricken sophistry. The married
couple act in sensuality; no child has ever yet been begotten and
conceived out of dutiful consideration for the State's need of recruits
or taxpayers. To be quite logical, an ethical system which branded
the act of procreation as shameful would have to demand complete
and unconditional abstinence. If we do not wish to see life become
extinct we should not call the source from which it is renewed a sink
of vice. Nothing has poisoned the morals of modern society more
than this ethical system which by neither condemning logically nor
approving logically blurs the distinction between good and evil and
bestows on sin a glittering allurement. More than anything it is to
blame for the fact that the modern man vacillates aimlessly in ques­
tions of sexual morality, and is not even capable of properly
appreciating the great problems of the relations between the
sexes.
It is clear that sex is less important in the life of man than of
woman. Satisfaction brings him relaxation and mental peace. But
1 02

FREE LOVE
for the woman the burden of motherhood begins here. Her destir.y
is completely circumscribed by sex; in man's life it is but an incident.
However fervently and wholeheartedly he loves, however much he
takes upon himself for the woman's sake, he remains always above
the sexual. Even women are finally contemptuous of the man who is
utterly engrossed by sex. But woman must exhaust herself as lover
and as mother in the service of the sexual instinct. Man may often
find it difficult, in the face of all the worries of his profession, to pre­
serve his inner freedom and so to develop his individuality, but it will
not be his sexual life which distracts him most. For woman, however,
sex is the greatest obstacle.
Thus the meaning of the feminist question is essentially woman's
struggle for personality. But the matter affects men not less than
women, for only in co-operation can the sexes reach the highest de­
gree of individual culture. The man who is always being dragged by
woman into the IOl/ver spheres of psychic bondage cannot develop
freely in the long run. To preserve the freedom of inner life for the
woman, this is the real problem of women; it is part of the cultural
problem of humanity.
It was failure to solve this problem which destroyed the Orient.
There woman is an object of lust, a childbearer and nurse. Every
progressive movement which began with the development of per­
sonality was prematurely frustrated by the women, who dragged men
down again into the miasma of the harem. Nothing separates East
and West more decisively to-day than the position of women and the
attitude towards woman. People often maintain that the wisdom
of the Orientals has understood the ultimate questions of existence
more profoundly than all the philosophy of Europe. At any rate the
fact that they have never been able to free themselves in sexual
matters has sealed the fate of their culture.
Midway between Orient and Occident the unique culture of the
Greeks grew up. But antiquity also failed to raise woman to the level
on which it had placed man. Greek culture excluded the married
woman. The wife remained in the woman's quarters, apart from the
world, nothing more than the mother of the man's heirs and the
steward of his house. His love was for the hetaera alone. Eventually
he was not satisfied even here, and turned to homosexual love.
Plato sees the love of boys transfigured by the spiritual union of the
lovers and by joyful surrender to the beauty of soul and body.
103

T H E S O C I A L O R D E R A N D T H E FA M I LY
To him the love of woman was merely gross sensual satisfaction.
To Western man woman is the companion, to the Oriental she is
the bedfellow. European woman has not always occupied the posi­
tion she occupies to-day. She has won it in the course of evolution
from the principle of violence to the principle of contract. And now
man and woman are equal before the law. The small differences
which still exist in private law are of no practical significance.
Whether, for example, the law obliges the wife to obey her husband
is not particularly important; as long as marriage survives one party
will have to follow the other and whether husband or wife is stronger
is certainly not a matter which paragraphs of the legal code can
decide. Nor is it any longer of great significance that the political
rights of women are restricted, that women are denied the vote and
the right to hold public office. For by granting the vote to women
the proportional political strength of the political parties is not on
the whole much altered ; the women of those parties which must
suffer from the changes to be expected (not in any case important
ones) ought in their own interests to become opponents of women's
suffrage rather than supporters. The right to occupy public office is
denied women less by the legal limitations of their rights than by the
peculiarities of their sexual character. Without underestimating the
value of the feminists' fight to extend woman's civil rights, one can
safely risk the assertion that neither women nor the community are
deeply injured by the slights to women's legal position which still
remain in the legislation of civilized states.
The misconception to which the principle of equality before the
law is exposed in the field of general social relationships is to be found
in the special field of the relations between those sexes. Just as the
pseudo-democratic movement endeavours by decrees to efface
natural and socially conditioned inequalities, just as it wants to make
the strong equal to the weak, the talented to the untalented, and the
healthy to the sick, so the radical wing of the women's movement
seeks to make women the equal of men. 1 Though they cannot go so
far as to shift half the burden of motherhood on to men, still they
would like to abolish marriage and farnily life so that women may
have at least all that liberty which seems compatible with child­
bearing. Unencumbered by husband and children, woman is to

women whose sexual character was not normally developed would go beyond the
limits set to these expositions.
1 04

FREE LOVE
move freely, act freely, and live for herself and the development of
her personality.
But the difference between sexual character and sexual destiny
can no more be decreed away than other inequalities of mankind.
It is not marriage which keeps woman inwardly unfree, but the fact
that her sexual character demands surrender to a man and that her
love for husband and children consumes her best energies. There is
no human law to prevent the woman who looks for happiness in a
career from renouncing love and marriage. But those who do not
renounce them are not left with sufficient strength to master life as
a man may mastet it. It is the fact that sex possesses her whole per­
sonality, and not the facts of marriage and family, which enchains
woman. By 'abolishing' marriage one would not make woman any
freer and happier; one would merely take from her the essential con­
tent of her life, and one could offer nothing to replace it.
Woman's struggle to preserve her personality in marriage is part
of that struggle for personal integrity which characterizes the
rationalist society of the economic order based on private ownership
of the means of production. It is not exclusively to the interest of
woman that she should succeed in this struggle; to contrast the
interests of men and women, as extreme feminists try to do, is very
foolish. All mankind would suffer if woman should fail to develop
her ego and be unable to unite with man as equal, freeborn com­
panions and comrades.
To take away a woman's children and put them in an institution
is to take away part of her life; and children are deprived of the most
far-reaching influences when they are tom from the bosom of the
family. Only recently Freud, with the insight of genius, has shown
how deep are the impressions which the parental home leaves on the
child. From the parents the child learns to love, and so comes to
possess the forces which enable it to grow up into a healthy human
being. The segregated educational institution breeds homosexuality
and neurosis. It is no accident that the proposal to treat men and
women as radically equal, to regulate sexual intercourse by the State,
to put infants into public nursing homes at birth and to ensure that
children and parents remain quite unknown to each other should
have originated with Plato; he saw only the satisfaction of a physical
craving in the relations between the sexes.
The evolution which has led from the principle of violence to the

contractual principle has based these relations on free choice in love.
The woman may deny herself to anyone, she may demand fidelity
and constancy from the man to whom she gives herself. Only in this
way is the foundation laid for the development of woman's individu­
ality. By returning to the principle of violence with a conscious
neglect of the contractual idea, Socialism, even though it aims at an
equal distribution of the plunder, must finally demand promiscuity
in sexual life.

§6
Prostitution
The communist manifesto declares that the 'complement' of the
'bourgeois family' is public prostitution. 'With the disappearance of
capital' prostitution would also disappear. 1 A chapter in Bebel's
book on woman is headed 'Prostitution, a necessary social institution
of the bourgeois world'. Here is amplified the theory that prosti­
tution is as necessary to bourgeois society as 'police, standing army,
church, entrepreneurs, etc." Since its appearance the view that pro­
stitution is a product of Capitalism has gained ground enormously.
And as, in addition, preachers still complain that the good old morals
have decayed, .and accuse modern culture of having led to loose
living, everyone is convinced that all sexual wrongs represent a
symptom of decadence peculiar to our age.
In answer to this it is sufficient to point out that prostitution is
an extremely ancient institution, unknown to hardly any people that
has ever existed! It is a remnant of ancient morals, not a symptom
of the decay of higher culture. The most powerful influence against
it to-day - the demand for man's abstinence outside marriage - is
one of the. principles involved in equal moral rights for man and
woman, and is therefore altogether an ideal of the capitalist age.
The age of the principle of violence demands sexual purity only from
the bride, not from the bridegroom also. All those factors which
favour prostitution to-day have nothing whatever to do with private
property and Capitalism. Militarism, which keeps young men from

marriage longer than they wish, is anything but a product of peace­
loving Liberalism. The fact that government and other officials can
only marry when they are rich, as otherwise they would not be able
to keep up appearances, is, like all other caste fetishes, a vestige of
pre-capitalist thought. Capitalism does not recognize caste or caste
customs; under Capitalism everyone lives according to his income.
Some women prostitute themselves because they want men, some
because they want food. With many both motives operate. One may
admit without further discussion that in a society where incomes
were equal the economic temptation to prostitution would cease com­
pletely or dwindle to a minimum. But it would be idle to speculate
whether or not, in a society without inequalities of income, other
new social sources of prostitution could not arise. At any rate one
cannot merely assume that the sexual morality of a socialist society
would be more satisfactory than that of capitalist society.
It is in the study of the relations between sexual life and property,
more than in any other field of social knowledge, that our ideas must
be clarified and remodelled. Contemporary treatment of this pro­
blem is riddled with prejudices of all kinds. But the eyes with which
we look at the matter must not be those of the dreamer envisioning
a lost paradise, who sees the future in a blaze of rose-coloured light,
and condemns all that goes on around us.

THE NATURE OF
ECONOMIC ACTI VITY

§

I

A contribution to the critique of the concept 'Economic ActiviV"

CONOMIC Science originated in discussion of the money price of
Egoods and services. Its first beginnings are to be found in inquiries
about coinage, which developed into investigations of price move­
ments. Money, money prices, and everything concerned with
calculation in terms of money - these form the problems in the
discussion of which the science of Economics emerged. Those
attempts at economic inquiry, which are discernible in works on
household management and the organization of production - par­
ticularly agricultural - did not develop further in this direction.
They became merely the starting point for various departments of
technology and natural science. And this was no accident. Only
through the rationalization inherent in economic calculation based
on the use of money could the human mind come to understand and
trace the laws of its action.
The earlier economists did not ask themselves what the 'economic'
and 'economic activity' really were. They had enough to do with
the great tasks presented by the particular problems with which they
were then concerned. They were not concerned with methodology.
It was quite late before they began to grapple with the methods and
ultimate aims of economics, and its place in the general system of
knowledge. And then an obstacle was encountered which seemed
to be insurmountable - the problem of defining the subject matter
of economic activity.
All theoretical inquiries - those of the classical economists,
equally with those of the moderns - start from the economic
principle. Yet, as was necessarily soon perceived, this provides no
basis for clearly defining the subject matter of economics. The
economic principle is a general principle of rational action, and not
III

THE NAT U R E O F E C O N O M I C A C T I V I T Y
a specific principle of such action as forms the subject of economic
inquiry. l The economic principle directs all rational action, all
action capable of becoming the subject matter of a science. It
seemed absolutely unserviceable for separating the ' economic' from
the 'non-economic', so far as the traditional economic problems were
concerned.'
But, on the other hand, it was equally impossible to divide up
rational actions according to the immediate end to which they were
directed, and to regard as the subject matter of economics only those
actions which were directed to providing mankind with the com­
modities of the external world. Against such a procedure it is a
decisive objection that, in the last analysis, the provision of material
goods serves not only those ends which are usually termed economic,
but also many other ends.
Such a division of the motives of rational action involves a dual
conception of action - action from economic motives, on the one
side, action from non-economic motives, on the other - which is
absolutely irreconcilable with the necessary unity of will and action.
A theory of rational action must conceive such action as unitary.

Rational Action
Action based on reason, action therefore which is only to be
understood by reason, knows only one end, the greatest pleasure of
the acting individual. The attainment of pleasure, the avoidance
of pain - these are its intentions. By this, of course, we do not mean
'pleasure' and 'pain' in the sense in which these terms used to be
used. In the terminology of the modern economist, pleasure is to
be understood as embracing all those things which men hold to be
desirable, all that they want and strive for. There can therefore be
no longer any contrast between the 'noble' ethics of duty and the
vulgar hedonistic ethics. The modern concept of pleasure, happiness,
1 It was left to the empiric-realistic school, with its terrible confusion of all concepts,
to explain the economic principle as a specific of production under a money economy;

utility, satisfaction and the like includes all human ends, regardless
of whether the motives of action are moral or immoral, noble or
ignoble, altruistic or egotistical. 1
In general men act only because they are not completely satisfied.
Were they always to enjoy complete happiness, they would be
without will, without desire, without action . In the land of the
lotus-eaters there is no action. Action arises only from need, from
dissatisfaction. It is purposeful striving towards something. Its
ultimate end is always to get rid of a condition which is conceived
to be deficient - to fulfil a need, to achieve satisfaction, to increase
happiness. If men had all the external resources of nature so
abundantly at their disposal that they were able to obtain complete
satisfaction by action, then they could use them heedlessly. They
would only have to consider their own powers and the limited time
at their disposal. For, compared with the sum of their needs, they
would still have only a limited strength and a limited life-time

available. They would still have to economize time and labour.
But to economy of materials they would be indifferent. In fact,
however, materials are also limited, so that they too have to be used
in such a way that the most urgent needs are satisfied first, with the
least possible expenditure of materials for each satisfaction.
The spheres of rational action and economic action are therefore
co-incident. All rational action is economic. All economic activity
is rational action. All rational action is in the first place in­
dividual action. Only the individual thinks. Only the individual
reasons.

Only the individual ac.ts. How society arises from the

action of individuals will be shown in a later part of our discussion.

§3
Economic calculation
All human action, so far as it is rational, appears as the exchange
of one condition for another. Men apply economic goods and
personal time and labour in the direction which, under the given
circumstances, promises the highest degree of satisfaction, and they

THE NATURE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
forego the satisfaction of lesser needs so as to satisfy the more urgent
needs. This is the essence of economic activity - the carrying out
of acts of exchange. 1 I
Every man who, in the course of economic activity, chooses
between the satisfaction of two needs, only one of which can be
satisfied, makes judgments of value. Such judgments concern firstly
and directly the satisfactions themselves; it is only from these that
they are reflected back upon goods. As a rule anyone in possession
of his senses is able at once to evaluate goods which are ready for
consumption. Under very simple conditions he should also have
little difficulty in forming a judgment upon the relative significance

to him of the factors of production. When, however, conditions are
at all complicated, and the connection between things is harder to
detect, we have to make more delicate computations if we are to
evaluate such instruments. Isolated man can easily decide whether
to extend his hunting or his cultivation. The processes of production
he has to take into account are relatively short. The expenditure
they demand and the product they afford can easily be perceived as
a whole. But to choose whether we shall use a waterfall to produce
electricity or extend coal-mining and better utilize the energy con­
tained in coal, is quite another matter. Here the processes of pro­
duction are so m�ny and so long, the conditions necessary to the
success of the undertaking, so multitudinous, that we can never be
content with vague ideas. To decide whether an undertaking is
sound we must calculate carefully.
But computation demands units. And there can be no unit of the
subjective use-value of commodities. Marginal utility provides no
unit of value. The worth of two units of a given commodity is not
twice as great as one - although it is necessarily greater or smaller
than one. Judgments of value do not measure: they arrange, they
grade.' If he relies only on subjective valuation, even isolated man
cannot arrive at a decision based on more or less exact computations
in cases where the solution is not immediately evident. To aid his
calculations he must assume substitution relations between com­

modities. As a rule he will not be able to reduce all to a common

unit. But he may succeed in reducing all elements in the computa­
tion to such commodities as he can evaluate immediately, that is to
say, to goods ready for consumption and the disutility of labour and
then he is able to base his decision upon this evidence. It is obvious
that even this is possible only in very simple cases. For complicated
and long processes of production it would be quite out of the
question.
In an exchange economy, the objective exchange value of com­
modities becomes the unit of calculation. This involves a threefold
advantage. In the first place we are able to take as the basis of cal­
culation the valuation of all individuals participating in trade. The
subjective valuation of one individual is not directly comparable with
the subjective valuation of others. It only becomes so as an exchange
value arising from the interplay of the subjective valuations of all who
take part in buying and selling. Secondly, calculations of this sort
provide a control upon the appropriate use of the means of production.
They enable those who desire to calculate the cost of complicated
processes of production to see at once whether they are working as
economically as others. If, under prevailing market prices, they can­
not carry through the process at a profit, it is a clear proof that others
are better able to turn to good account the instrumental goods in
question. Finally, calculations based upon exchange values enable
us to reduce values to a common unit. And since the higgling of the
market establishes substitution relations between commodities, any
commodity desired can be chosen for this purpose. In a money
economy, money is the commodity chosen.
Money calculations have their limits. Money is neither a yard­
stick of value nor of prices. Money does not measure value. Nor are
prices measured in money: they are amounts of money. And,
although those who describe money as a 'standard of deferred pay­
ments' naively assume it to be so, as a commodity it is not stable in
value. The relation between money and goods perpetually fluctuates
not only on the 'goods side', but on the 'money side' also. As a rule,
indeed, these fluctuations are not too violent. They do not too much
impair the economic calculus, because under a state of continuous
change of all economic conditions, this calculus takes in view only
comparatively short periods, in which 'sound money' at least does
not change its purchasing power to any very great extent.
The deficiencies of money calculations arise for the most part, not
1 I5

THE NATUR E O F E CONOMIC ACTIVITY
because they are made in terms of a general medium of exchange,
money, but because they are based on exchange values rather than
on subjective use-values. For this reason all elements of value which
are not the subject of exchange elude such computations. If, for
example, we are considering whether a hydraulic power-works
would be profitable we cannot include in the computation the
damage which will be done to the beauty of the waterfalls unless the
fall in values due to a fall in tourist traffic is taken into account. Yet
we must certainly take such considerations into account when
dociding whether the undertaking shall be carried out.
Considerations such as these are often termed 'non-economic' .
And we may permit the expression for disputes about terminology
gain nothing. But not all such considerations should be called
irrational. The beauty of a place or of a building, the health of the
race, the honour of individuals or nations, even if (because they are
not dealt with on the market) they do not enter into exchange rela­
tions, are just as much motives of rational action, provided people
think them significant, as those normally called economic. That they
cannot enter into money calculations arises from the very nature of
these calculations. But this does not in the least lessen the value of
money calculations in ordinary economic matters. For all such
moral goods are goods of the first order. We can value them directly;
and therefore have no difficulty in taking them into account, even
though they lie outside the sphere of money computations. That they
elude such computations does not make it any more difficult to bear
them in mind. If we know precisely how much we have to pay for
beauty, health, honour, pride, and the like, nothing need hinder us
from giving them due consideration. Sensitive people may be pained
to have to choose between the ideal and the material. But that is not
the fault ofa money economy. It is in the nature of things. For even
where we can make judgments of value without money computations
we cannot avoid this choice. Both isolated man and socialist com­
munities would have to do likewise, and truly sensitive natures will
never find it painful. Called upon to choose between bread and
honour, they will never be at a loss how to act. If honour cannot be
eaten, eating can at least be foregone for honour. Only such as fear
the agony of choice because they secretly know that they could not
forego the material, will regard the necessity of choice as a
profanation.

1 16

E C O N O M I C C A L CU L A TION

Money computations are only significant for purposes of ecomonic
calculation. Here they are used in order that the disposal of com­
modities may conform to the criterion of economy. And such calcu­
lations take account of commodities only in the proportions in which,
under given conditions, they exchange for money. Every extension
of the sphere of money calculation is misleading. It is misleading
when in historical researches, it is employed as a measure of past com­
modity values. It is misleading when it is employed to evaluate the
{:apital or national income of nations. It is misleading when it is
employed to estimate the value of things which are not exchangeable
as, for instance, when people attempt to estimate the loss due to
emigration or war. 1 All these are dilettantisms - even when they
are undertaken by the most competent economists.
But within these limits - and in practical life they are not over­
stepped - money calculation does all that we are entitled to ask of
it. I t provides a guide amid the bewildering throng of economic
possibilities. It enables us to extend judgments of value which apply
directly only to consumption goods - or at best to production goods
of the lowest order - to all goods of higher orders. Without it, all
production by lengthy and roundabout processes would be so many

steps in the dark.
Two things are necessary if computations of value in terms of
money are to take place. First, not only goods ready for consumption
but .also goods of higher orders must be exchangeable. If this were
not so, a system of exchange relationships could not emerge. It is
true that if an isolated man is 'exchanging' labour and flour for
bread within his own house, the considerations he has to take into
account are not different from those which would govern his actions
if he were to exchange bread for clothes on the market. And it is,
therefore, quite correct to regard all economic activity, even the
economic activity of isolated man, as exchange. But no single man,
be he the greatest genius ever born, has an intellect capable of de­
ciding the relative importance of each one of an infinite number of
goods of higher orders. No individual could so discriminate between
the infinite number of alternative methods of production that he
could make direct judgments of their relative value without auxiliary
calculations. In societies based on the division of labour, the

117

THE NATUR E O F ECON O M I C ACTIV I TY
distribution of property rights effects a kind of mental division of
labour, without which neither economy nor systematic production
would be possible.
In the second place, there must be a general medium of exchange,
a money, in use. And this must serve as an intermediary in the
exchange of production goods equally with the rest. If this were not
so, it would be impossible to reduce all exchange relationships to a
common denominator.
Only under very simple conditions is it possible to dispense with
money calculations. In the narrow circle of a closed household,
where the father is able to supervise everything, he may be able to
evaluate alterations in methods of production without having re­
course to money reckoning. For, in such circumstances, production
is carried on with relatively little capital. Few roundabout methods
of production are employed. As a rule production is concerned with
consumption goods, or goods of higher orders not too far removed
from consumption goods. Division of labour is still in its earliest
stages. The labourer carries through the production of a commodity
from beginning to end. In an advanced society all this is changed.
It is impossible to argue from the experience of primitive societies
that under modem conditions we can dispense with money.
In the simple conditions of a closed household, it is possible to
survey the whole process of production from beginning to end. It is
possible to judge whether one particular process gives more con­
sumption goods than another. But, in the incomparably more com­
plicated conditions of our own day, this is no longer possible. True,
a socialistic society could see that 1000 litres of wine were better than
800 litres. It could decide whether or not 1 000 litres of wine were to
be preferred to 500 litres of oil. Such a decision would involve no
calculation. The will of some man would decide. But the real busi­
ness of economic administration, the adaptation of means to ends
only begins when such a decision is taken. And only economic
calculation makes this adaptation possible. Without such assistance,
in the bewildering chaos of alternative materials and processes the
human mind would be at a complete loss. Whenever we had to
decide between different processes or different centres of production,
we would be entirely at sea. 1

ECONOMIC CALCULATION
To suppose that a socialist community could substitute calcula­
tions in kind for calculations in terms of money is an illusion. In a
community that does not practice exchange, calculations in kind can
never cover more than consumption goods. They break down com­
pletely where goods of higher order are concented. Once society
abandons free pricing of production goods rational production
becomes impossible. Every step that leads away from private owner­
ship of the means of production and the use of money is a step away
from rational economic activity.
It was possible to overlook all this because such Socialism as we
know at first. hand exists only, one might say, in socialistic oases in
what, for the rest, is a system based upon free exchange and the use
of money. To this extent, indeed, we may agree with the otherwise
untenable socialist contention - it is only employed for propagandist
purposes - that nationalized and municipalized undertakings within
an otherwise capitalist system are not Socialism. For the existence of
a surrounding system of free pricing supports such concerns in their
business affairs to such an extent that in them the essential peculiarity
of economic activity under Socialism does not come to light. In
State and municipal undertakings it is still possible to carry out
technical improvements, because it is possible to observe the effects
of similar improvements in similar private undertakings at home and
abroad. In such concerns it is still possible to ascertain the advan­
tages of reorganization because they are surrounded by a society
which is still based upon private ownership in the means of produc­
tion and the use of money. It is still possible for them to keep books
and make calculations which for similar concerns in a purely socialist
environment would be entirely out of the question.
Without calculation, economic activity is impossible. Since under
Socialism economic calculation is impossible, under Socialism there
can be no economic activity in our sense of the word. In small and
insignificant things rational action might still persist. But, for the
most part, it would no longer be possible to speak of rational produc­
tion. In the absence of criteria ofrationality, production could not be
consciously economical.
For some time possibly the accumulated tradition of thousands
of years of economic freedom would preserve the art of economic
administration from complete disintegration. Men would preserve
the old processes not because they were rational, but because they
I I9

THE NATURE O F E C O N O M I C A CT I V I T Y
were sanctified by tradition. In the meantime, however, changing
conditions would make them irrational. They would become un­
economical as the result of changes brought about by the general
decline of economic thought. It is true that production would no
longer be 'anarchical' . The command of a supreme authority would
govern the business of supply. Instead of the economy of 'anarchical'
production the senseless order of an irrational machine would be
supreme. The wheels would go round, but to no effect.
Let us try to imagine the position of a socialist community.
There will be hundreds and thousands of establishments in which
work is going on. A minority of these will produce goods ready for
use. The majority will produce capital goods and semi-manufac­
tures. All these establishments will be closely connected. Each
commodity produced will pass through a whole series of such estab­
lishments before it is ready for consumption. Yet in the incessant
press of ali these processes the economic administration wili have no
real sense of direction. It will have no means of ascertaining whether
a given piece of work is really necessary, whether labour and material
are not being wasted in completing it. How would it discover which
of two processes was the more satisfactory? At best, it could compare
the quantity of ultimate products. But only rarely could it compare
the expenditure incurred in their production. It would know exactly
- or it would imagine it knew - what it wanted to produce. It
ought therefore to set about obtaining the desired results with the
smallest possible expenditure. But to do this it would have to be able
to make calculations. And such calculations must be calculations of
value. They could not be merely 'technical', they could not be cal­
culations of the objective use-value of goods and services. This is so
obvious that it needs no further demonstration.
Under a system based upon private ownership in the means of
production, the scale of values is the outcome of the actions of every
independent member of society. Everyone plays a two-fold part in
its establishment first as a consumer, secondly as producer. As con­
sumer, he establishes the valuation of goods ready for consumption.
As producer, he guides production-goods into those uses in which
they yield the highest product. In this way all goods of higher orders
also are graded in the way appropriate to them under the existing
conditions of production and the demands of society. The interplay
of these two processes ensures that the economic principle is observed
1 20

E C O N O M I C C A L C U LAT I O N
in both consumption and production. And, in this way, arises the
exactly graded system of prices which enables everyone to frame his
demand on economic lines.
Under Socialism, all this must necessarily be lacking. The
economic administration may indeed know exactly what commo­
dities are needed most urgently. But this is only half the problem.
The other half, the valuation of the means of production, it cannot
solve. It can ascertain the value of the totality of such instruments.
That is obviously equal to the value of the satisfactions they afford.
If it calculates the loss that would be incurred by withdrawing them,
it can also ascertain the value of single instruments of production.
But it cannot assimilate them to a common price denominator, as
can be done under a system of economic freedom and money prices.
It is not necessary that Socialism should dispense altogether with
money. It is possible to conceive arrangements permitting the use
of money for the exchange of consumers goods. But since the prices
of the various factors of production (including labour) could not
be expressed in money, money could play no part in economic
calculations. '
Suppose, for instance, that the socialist commonwealth was con­
templating a new railway line. Would a new railway line be a good
thing? Ifso, which of many possible routes should it cover? Under a
system of private ownership we could use money calculations to
decide these questions. The new line would cheapen the transporta­
tion of certain articles, and, on this basis, we could estimate whether
the reduction in transport charges would be great enough to counter­
weigh the expenditure which the building and running of the line
would involve. Such a calculation could be made only in money.
We could not do it by comparing various classes of expenditure and
savings in kind. If it is out of the question to reduce to a common
unit the quantities of various kinds of skilled and unskilled labour,
iron, coal, building materials of different kinds, machinery and the
other things which the building and upkeep of railways necessitate,
then it is impossible to make them the subject of economic calcula­
tion. We can make systematic economic plans only when all the
1 Neurath too admitted this. (Durch die Kriegswirtschaft :;rUT Naturalwirtschaft,
Mlinchen 1919, p. 2 1 6 et seq.) He asserts that every complete administrative economy
(planned economy) is ultimately a natural economy (barter system). 'To socialize
therefore means to advance the natural economy.' Neurath, however, did not recognize
the insurmountable difficulties economic calculation would encounter in the socialist
community.

12 1

T H E NAT U R E O F E C O N O M I C A C T I V I T Y
commodities which we have to take into account can be assimilated
to money. True, money calculations are incomplete. True, they
have profound deficiencies. But we have nothing better to put in
their place. And under sound monetary conditions they suffice for
practical purposes. If we abandon them, economic calculation
becomes absolutely impossible.
This is not to say that the socialist community would be entirely
at a loss. It would decide for or against the proposed undertaking
and issue an edict. But, at best, such a decision would be based on
vague valuations. It could not be based on exact calculations of value.
A stationary society could, indeed, dispense with these calcula­
tions. For there, economic operations merely repeat themselves.
So that, if we assume that the socialist system of production were
based upon the last state of the system of economic freedom which
it superseded, and that no changes were to take place in the future,
we could indeed conceive a rational and economic Socialism. But
only in theory. A stationary economic system can never exist.
Things are continually changing, and the stationary state, although
necessary as an aid to speculation, is .a theoretical assumption to
which there is no counterpart in reality. And, quite apart from this,
the maintenance of such a connection with the last state of the
exchange economy would be out of the question, since the transition
to Socialism with its equalization of incomes would necessarily trans­
form the whole 'set' of consumption and production. And then we
have a socialist community which must cross the whole ocean of
possible and imaginable economic permutations without the compass
of economic calculation.
All economic change, therefore, would involve operations the
value of which could neither be predicted beforehand nor ascertained
after they had taken place. Everything would be a leap in the dark.
Socialism is the renunciation of rational economy.

The

capitalist ecoiUiii':Y

The terms 'Capitalism' and 'Capitalistic Production' are political
catchwords. They were invented by socialists, not to extend know­
ledge, but to carp, to criticize, to condemn. To-day, they have only
1 22

THE CAPITAL I S T E C O NO MY
to be uttered to conjure up a picture of the relentless exploitation of
wage-slaves by the pitiless rich. They are scarcely ever used save to
imply a disease in the body-politic. From a scientific point of view,
they are so obscure and ambiguous that they have no value whatever.
Their users agree only in this, that they indicate the characteristics
of the modern economic system. But wherein these characteristics
consist is always a matter of dispute. Their use, therefore, is entirely
pernicious, and the proposal to extrude them altogether from
economic terminology, and to leave them to the matadors of popular
agitation, deserves serious consideration. 1
If, nevertheless, we do desire to discover for them a precise
application, we should start from the idea of capital calculations.
And since we are concerned only with the analysis of actual economic
phenomena, and not with economic theory - where 'capital' is often
used in a sense specially extended for particular purposes - we must
first ask what significance is attached to the term in business practice.
There we find it used only for purposes of economic calculation. It
serves to bring the original properties of a concern under one de­
nomination, whether they consisted of money or were only expressed
in money.' The object of its computations is to enable us to ascertain
how much the value of this property has altered in the course of
business operations. The concept of capital is derived from economic
calculation. Its true home is accountancy - the chief instrument of
commercial rationality. Calculation in terms of money is an essential
element of the concept of capital.'
If the term capitalism is used to designate an economic system in
which production is governed by capital calculations, it acquires a
special significance for defining economic activity. Understood thus,
it is by no means misleading to speak of Capitalism and capitalistic
methods of production, and expressions such as the capitalistic spirit
and the anti-capitalistic disposition acquire a rigidly circumscribed
connotation. Capitalism is better suited to be the antithesis of
Socialism than Individualism, which is often used in this way. As a
rule those who contrast Socialism with Individualism proceed on the

gradually lose the moral colouring.

tacit assumption that there is a contradiction between the interests
of the individual and the interest of society, and that, while Socialism
takes the public welfare as its object, individualism serves the interests
of particular people. And since this is one of the gravest sociological
fallacies we must avoid carefully any form of expression which might
allow it secretly to creep in.
According to Passow, where the term Capitalism is used correctly,
the association it is intended to convey is usually bound up with the
development and spread oflarge scale undertakings. 1 We may admit
this - even ifit is rather difficult to reconcile with the fact that people
customarily speak of 'Grosskapital' and 'Grosskapitalist' and then
of 'Kleinkapitalisten'. But, if we recollect that only capital calcula­
tion made the growth of giant enterprise and undertakings possible,
this does not in any way invalidate the definitions we propose.

§5
The narrower concept of the 'economic'
The common habit of economists of distinguishing between
'economic' or 'purely economic' and 'non-economic' action is just
as unsatisfactory as the old distinction between ideal and material
goods. For willing and acting are unitary. All ends conflict among
themselves and it is this conflict which ranges them in one scale. Not
only the satisfaction of wishes, desires and impulses that can be at­
tained through interaction with the external world, but the satisfac..
tion also of ideal needs must be judged by one criterion. In life we
have to choose between the 'ideal' and the 'material'. It is, therefore,
just as essential to make the former subject to a unitary criterion of
values as the latter. In choosing between bread and honour, faith
and wealth, love and money, we submit both alternatives to one test.
It is, therefore, illegitimate to regard the 'economic' as a definite
sphere of human action which can be sharply delimited from other
spheres of action. Economic activity is rational activity. And since
complete satisfaction is impossible, the sphere of economic activity
is c�terminous with the sphere of ratiom�l action. It consists firstly
in valuation of ends, and then in the valuation of the means leading
to these ends. All economic activity depends, therefore, upon the
1 Passow, op. at. (2nd Edition), p. 132 et. seq.

1 24

N A R R O W E R C O N C E PT O F T H E ' E C ON O M I C '
existence of ends. Ends dominate economy and alone give it meaning.
Since the economic principle applies to all human action, it is
necessary to be very careful when distinguishing, within its sphere,
between 'purely economic' and other kinds of action. Such a division
is indeed indispensable for many scientific purposes. It singles out
one particular end and contrasts it with all others. This end - at this
point we need not discuss whether it is ultimate or not - is the
attainment of the greatest possible product measured in money. It
is, therefore, impossible to assign it a specially delimited sphere of
action. It is true that for each individual it has such a delimited
sphere, but this varies in extent according to the general outlook of
the individual concerned. It is one thing for the man to whom
honour is dear. It is another for him who sells his friend for gold.
Neither the nature of the end nor the peculiarity of the means is what
justifies the distinction, but merely the special nature of the methods
employed. Only the fact that it uses exact calculation distinguishes
'purely economic' from other action.
The sphere of the 'purely economic' is nothing more and nothing
less than the sphere of money calculation. The fact that in a certain
field of action it enables us to compare means with minute exactitude
down to the smallest detail means so much both for thought and
action that we tend to invest this kind of action with special impor­
tance. It is easy to overlook the fact that such a distinction is only a
distinction in the technique of thought and action and in no way a
distinction in the ultimate end of action - which is unitary. The
failure of all attempts to exhibit the 'economic' as a special depart­
ment of the rational and within that to discover still another sharply
defined department, the 'purely economic' , is no fault of the analytical
apparatus employed. There can be no doubt that great subtlety of
analysis has been concentrated on this problem, and the fact that it
has not been solved clearly indicates that the question is one to which
no satisfactory answer can be given. The sphere of the 'economic' is
plainly the same as the sphere of the rational : and the sphere of
the 'purely economic' is nothing but the sphere in which money
calculation is possible.
In the last resort the individual can acknowledge one end, and
one end only: the attainment of the greatest satisfaction. This ex­
pression includes the satisfying of all kinds of human wants and
desires, regardless whether they are 'material' or immaterial (moral) .
1 25

THE NATURE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
In the place of the word 'satisfaction' we could employ the word
'happiness', had we not to fear the misunderstandings, for which the
controversy on Hedonism and Eudaemonism was responsible.
Satisfaction is subjective. Modern social philosophy has em­
phasized this so sharply in contrast to former theories that there is a
tendency to forget that the physiological structure of mankind and
the unity of outlook and emotion arising from tradition create a far­
reaching similarity of views regarding wants and the means to satisfy
them. It is precisely this similarity of views which makes society
possible. Because they have common aims, men are able to live
together. Against this fact that the majority of ends (and those the
most important) are common to the great mass of mankind, the fact
that some ends are only entertained by a few is of subordinate
importance.
The customary division between economic and non-economic
motives is, therefore, invalidated by the fact that on the one hand,
the end of economic activity lies outside the range of economics, and
on the other, that all rational activity is economic. Nevertheless,
there is good justification for separating 'purely economic' activities
(that is to say, activity susceptible of valuation in money) from all
other forms of activity. For, as we have already seen, outside the
sphere of money calculation there remain only intermediate ends
which are capable of evaluation by immediate inspection: and once
this sphere is left, it is necessary to have recourse to such judgments.
It is the recognition of this necessity which provides the occasion for
the distinction we have been discussing.
If, for example, a nation desires to make war, it is illegitimate to
regard the desire as necessarily irrational because the motive for
making war lies outside those customarily considered as 'economic' as might be the case, e.g. with wars of religion. If the nation decides
on the war with complete knowledge of all the facts because it
judges that the end in view is more important than the sacrifice
involved, and because it regards war as the most suitable means of
obtaining it, then war cannot be regarded as irrational. It is not
necessary at this point to decide whether this supposition is ever true
or if it ever can be true. It is precisely this which has to be examined
when one comes to choose between war and peace. And it is pre­
cisely with a view to introducing clarity into such an examination
that the distinction we have been discussing has been introduced.

I t is only necessary to remember how often wars or tariffs. are
recommended as being 'good business' from the 'economic' point of
view to realize how often this is forgotten. How much clearer would
have been the political discussions of the last century if the distinction
between the 'purely economic' and the 'non-economic' grounds of
action had been kept in mind.

THE ORGANI ZATION OF PRODU CTION
UNDER SOCIALISM

§I
The snciali�ation of the means of production
Socialism all the means of production are the property of
The community alone disposes of them and
decides how to use them in production. The community produces,
the products accrue to the community, and the community decides
how those products are to be used.
·
Modern socialists, especially those of the Marxian persuasion, lay
great emphasis on designating the socialist community as Society,
and therefore on describing the transfer of the means of production
to the control of the community as the 'Socialization of the means of
production'. In itself the expression is unobjectionable but in the
connection in which it is used it is particularly designed to obscure
one of the most important problems of Socialism.
The word 'society', with its corresponding adjective 'social', has
three separate meanings. It implies, first, the abstract idea of social
interrelationships, and secondly, the concrete conception of a union
of the individuals themselves. Between these two sharply different
meanings, a third has been interposed in ordinary speech: the ab­
stract society is conceived as personified in such expressions as
'human society', 'civil society'.
Now Marx uses the term with all these meanings. This would
not matter as long as he made the distinction quite clear. But he
does just the opposite. He interchanges them with a conjurer's skill
whenever it appears to suit him. When he talks of the social character
of capitalistic production he is using social in its abstract sense. When
he speaks of the society which suffers during- crises he means the
pers�nified society of �ankind. But when he speaks of the society
which is to expropriate the expropriators and socialize the means of
production he means an actual social union. And all the meanings
are interchanged in the links of his argument whenever he has to

U the community.

SOCIALI ZATION OF PRODUCT ION
prove the unprovable. The reason for all this is in order to avoid
using the term State or its equivalent, since this word has an un­
pleasant sound to all those lovers of freedom and democracy, whose
support the Marxian does not wish to alienate at the outset. A pro­
gramme which would give the State the general responsibility and
direction of all production has no prospect of acceptance in these
circles. It follows that the Marxist must continually find a phrase­
ologywhich disguises the essence of the programme, which succeeds in
concealing the unbridgeable abyss dividing democracy and Socialism.
I t does not say much for the perception of men who lived in the
decades immediately preceding the World War that they did not see
through this sophistry.
The modern doctrine of the state understands by the word 'State'
an authoritative unit, an apparatus of compulsion characterized not
by its aims but by its form. But Marxism has arbitrarily limited the
meaning of the word State, so that it does not inciude the Sociaiistic
State. Only those states and forms of state organization are called
the State which arouse the dislike of the socialist writers. For the
future organization to which they aspire the term is rejected in­
dignantly as dishonourable and degrading. It is called 'Society'. In
this way the Marxian social democracy could at one and the same
time contemplate the destruction of the existing State machine,
fiercely combat all anarchistic movements, and pursue a policy which
led directly to an all powerful state. 1
Now it does not matter in the least what particular name is
given to the coercive apparatus of the socialistic community. If we
use the word ' State' we have a term in common use, except in the
quite uncritical Marxian literature, an expression which is generally
understood and which evokes the idea it is intended to evoke. But
there is no disadvantage in avoiding this term if we wish, since it
arouses mixed feelings in many people, and in substituting the ex­
pression 'community'. The choice of terminology is purely a matter
of style, and has no practical importance.
What is important is the problem of the organization of this
socialistic State or community. When dealing with the concrete ex­
pression of the will of the State, the English language provides a
more subtle distinction by permitting us to use the term government
instead of the term state. Nothing is better designed to avoid the
1 See the critique of Kelsen, Staat und Gesellschaft, p. 1 1 et seq.

1 29

PRO D U C T ION UNDER S O C I A L I S M
mysticism which in this connection has been fostered by Marxian
usages to the highest degree. For the Marxists talk glibly about
expressing the will of society, without giving the slightest hint how
'society' can proceed to will and act. Yet of course the community
can only act through organs which it has created.
Now it follows from the very conception of the socialistic com­
munity that the organ of control must be unitary. A socialist com­
munity can have only one ultimate organ of control which combines
all economic and other governmental functions. Of course this organ
can be subdivided and there can be subordinate offices to which
definite instructions are transmitted. But the unitary expression of
the common will, which is the essential object of the socialization of
the means of production and of production, necessarily implies that
all offices entrusted with the supervision of different affairs shall be
subordinate to one office. This office must have supreme authority
to resoive aii variations from the common purpose and unify the
executive aim. How it is constituted, and how the general will suc­
ceeds in expressing itself in and by it, is of minor importance in the
investigation of our particular problem. It does not matter whether
this organ is an absolute prince or an assembly of all citizens organized
as a direct or indirect democracy. It does not matter how this organ
conceives its will and expresses it. For our purpose we must consider
this as accomplished and we need not spend any time over the ques­
tion how it can be accomplished, whether it can be accomplished
or whether Socialism is already doomed because it cannot be
accomplished.
At the outset of our inquiry we must postulate that the socialistic
community is without foreign relations. It embraces the whole world
and its inhabitants. If we conceive it as limited, so that it comprises
only a part of the world and the inhabitants therein, we must assume
that it has no economic relations with the territories and peoples out­
side its boundaries. We are to discuss the problem of the isolated
socialistic community. The implications of the contemporaneous
existence of several socialistic communities will be dealt with when
we have surveyed the problem in complete generality.

ECONOMIC CALCULATION

Economic calculation in the socialist communiry
The theory of economic calculation shows that in the socialistic
community economic calculation would be impossible.
In any large undertaking the individual works or departments
are partly independent in their accounts. They can reckon the cost
of materials and labour, and it is possible at any time for an indi­
vidual group to strike a separate balance and to sum up the results
ofits activity in figures. In this way it is possible to ascertain with what
success each separate branch has been operated and thereby to make
decisions concerning the reorganization, limitations or extension of
existing branches or the establishment of new ones. Some mistakes
are of course unavoidable in these calculations. They arise partly
from the difficulty of allocating overhead costs. Other mistakes again
arise from the necessity of calculating from insufficiently determined
data, as, e.g. when in calculating the profitability of a certain pro­
cess, depreciation of the machinery employed is determined by assum­
ing a certain working life for the machine. But all such errors can
be confined within certain narrow limits which do not upset the total
result of the calculation. Whatever uncertainty remains is attributed
to the uncertainty of future conditions inevitable in any imaginable
state of affairs.
It seems natural then to ask why individual branches of produc­
tion in a socialistic community should not make separate accounts
in the same manner. But this is impossible. Separate accounts for a
single branch of one and the same undertaking are possible only
when prices for all kinds of goods and services are established in the
market and furnish a basis of reckoning. Where there is no market
there is no price system, and where there is no price system there can
be no economic calculation.
Some may think that it is possible to permit exchange between the
different groups of undertakings so as to establish a system of ex­
change relations (prices) and in this way create a basis for economic
calculation in the socialistic community. Thus within a framework
of a unitary economic system which does not recognize private pro­
perty in the means of production, individual branches of industry
with separate administration could be set up, subject of course, to

131

PRODUCT ION UNDER SOCIALISM
the supreme economic authority, but able to transfer to each other
goods and services for a consideration reckoned in a common
medium of exchange. This roughly, is how people conceive the pro­
ductive organization of socialistic industry when they speak nowadays
of complete socialization and the like. But here again the decisive
point is evaded. Exchange relations in productive goods can only
be established on the basis of private property in the means of pro­
duction. If the Coal Syndicate delivers coal to the Iron Syndicate a
price can be fixed only if both syndicates own the means of
production in the industry. But that would not be Socialism but
Syndicalism.
For those socialist writers who accept the labour theory of value
the problem is, of course, quite simple.
'As soon,' says Engels, 'as Society has taken possession of the
means of production and applies them to direct social production the
labour of everyone, however different its specific use may be, will
immediately become direct social labour. The amount of social
labour inherent in any product does not require to be ascertained in
any roundabout way: everyday experience will show how much of it
on the average is necessary. Society can easily reckon how many
hours of labour inhere in a steam engine, in a hectolitre of wheat of
the last harvest, in a hundred square metres of cloth of a certain
quality. Of course society will have to find out how much work is
required for the manufacture of every article of consumption. It will
have to base its plans on a consideration of the means of production
at its disposal - and of course the labour force falls into this category.
The utility of the different objects of consumption weighed against
one another and against the labour necessary for their production
will finally determine the plan. The people will decide every­
thing quite easily without the intervention of the much-vaunted
value.' 1
It is not part of our business here to restate the critical arguments
against the labour theory of value. They interest us at this point only
in so far as they enable us to judge the possibility of making labour the
basis of economic calculation in a socialistic community.
At first sight it would appear that calculations based on labour
take into account the natural conditions of production, as well as
conditions arising from the human element. The Marxian concept
1

Engels, Herrn EIlgen Diihrings Umwiilzung der Wissenschaft, p. 335 et seq.
1 32

ECONOMIC CALCULATION
of the socially necessary labour time takes the law of diminishing
returns into consideration in so far as it results from different natural
conditions of production. If the demand for a commodity increases
and less favourable natural conditions have to be exploited, then the
average socially necessary time for the production of a unit also
increases. Ifmore favoarable conditions of production are discovered
then the necessary quantum of social labour declines. 1 But this is not
enough. Computation of changes in marginal labour costs only take
account of natural conditions in so far as they influence labour costs.
Beyond that, the 'labour' calculation breaks down. It leaves, for
instance, the consumption of material factors of production entirely
out of account. Suppose the socially necessary labour time for pro­
ducing two commodities P and Q is ten hours, and that the produc­
tion of a unit both of P and of Q requires material A, one unit of
which is produced by one hour of socially necessary labour, and that
the production ofP invoives two units ofA and eight hours oflabour,
and of Q one unit of A and nine hours of labour. In a calculation
based on labour time P and Q are equivalent, but in a calculation
based on value P must be worth more than Q. The former calcula­
tion is false. Only the latter corresponds to the essence and object of
economic calculation. It is true that this surplus by which the value
of P exceeds that of Q, this material substratum, 'is furnished by
nature without the help of man', 2 but provided it is present only in
such quantities that it becomes an economic factor it must also in
some form enter into economic calculation.
The second deficiency of the labour calculation theory is that it
disregards differences in the quality of labour. For Marx all human
labour is economically homogeneous, because it is always the 'pro­
ductive expenditure of human brain, muscles, nerves, hands, etc.'
'Skilled labour is only intensified, or rather multiplied simple labour,
so that a small quantity of skilled labour equals a larger quantity of
simple labour. Experience shows that this resolution of skilled into
simple constandy happens. A commodity may be the product of
highly skilled labour, but its value equates it to the product of simple
labour and represents only a certain quantity of simple labour."
Bohm-Bawerk was justified in describing this argument as a master-

1 33

PRODUCTI ON UNDER SOCIALISM
piece of astounding naivety. 1 In criticizing it one may conveniently
leave undecided whether one can discover a unitary physiological
measure of all human labour, physical as well as 'mental'. For it is
certain that between men themselves there are differences of capa­
bility and skill which result in differing qualities of the goods and
services produced. What is ultimately decisive for the solution of the
problem of the feasibility of using labour as a basis of economic
calculation is the question whether one can assimilate different kinds
of work to a common denominator without a valuation of the pro­
ducts by the consumer. It is clear that the argument which Marx
brings to bear on this point has failed. Experience does indeed show
that commodities enter into exchange regardless of the question
whether they are the products of skilled or simple labour. But this
would only prove that a definite quantity of simple labour is equal
to a definite quantity of skilled labour if it were proved that labour
is the source of exchange value. But not only is this unproven; it is
exactly what Marx originally set out to prove. The fact that in
exchange a substitute relation between simple and skilled labour has
arisen in the form of wage rates - a point to which Marx does not
here allude - is not in the least a proof of this homogeneity. This
process of equating is a result of the working of the market, not its
presupposition. Calculations based on labour cost rather than on
monetary values would have to establish a purely arbitrary relation
by which to resolve skilled into simple labour, and this would make
them useless as an instrument for the economic organization of
resources.
It was long thought that the labour theory of value provided a
necessary ethical basis for the demand to socialize the means of pro­
duction. We know now that this was an error. Although the majority
of socialists have adopted this view and although even Marx with his
professedly non-ethical standpoint could not shake it off, it is clear
that, on the one hand, the political demands for the introduction of
the socialistic method of production neither need nor receive support
from the labour theory of value, and, on the other hand, that those
who hold different views on the nature and causes of value can also
have socialistic tendencies. But from another point of view, the
labour theory of value is still an essential dogma for the advocates of

the socialistic method of production. For socialistic production in a
society based on division of labour seems practicable only if there is
an objective recognizable unit of value which would enable economic
calculations to be made in an exchangeless and moneyless community
and labour seems the only thing to serve this purpose.

§3
Recent socialist doctrines and the problems of economic calculation
The problem of economic calculation is the fundamental problem
of Socialism. That for decades people could write and talk about
Socialism without touching this problem only shows how devastating
were the effects of the Marxian prohibition on scientific scrutiny of
the nature and working of a socialist economy. 1
To prove that economic calculation would be impossible in the
socialist community is to prove also that Socialism is impracticable.
Everything brought forward in favour of Socialism during the last
hundred years, in thousands of writings and speeches, all the blood
which has been spilt by the supporters of Socialism, cannot make
Socialism workable. The masses may long for it ever so ardently,
innumerable revolutions and wars may be fought for it, still it will
never be realized. Every attempt to carry it out will lead to syndi­
calism or, by some other route, to chaos, which will quickly dissolve
the society, based upon the division of labour, into tiny autarkous
groups.
The discovery of this fact is dearly most inconvenient for the
socialist parties, and socialists of all kinds have poured out attempts
to refute my arguments and to invent a system of economic calcula­
tion for Socialism. They have not been successful. They have not
1 We may point out here that as early as 1854 Gossen knew 'that only through private
property is the measure found for determining the quantity of each commodity which
it would be best to produce under given conditions. Therefore, the central authority,
proposed by the communists, for the distribution of the various tasks and their reward,
would very soon find that it had taken on a job the solution of which far surpasses the
abilities of individual men.' (Gossen, Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Ver­
,!ehrs, New Edition, Berlin 1889, p. 2 3 1 .) Pareto (Cours d'Economie Poiitique, Vo!. 1 1 ,

Coletivista in Giornale degli Economisti, Vo!. :XXXVII, 1 908, p. 409 et seq.) did not
penetrate to the core of the problem. Pierson clearly and completely recognized the
problem in 1902. See his Das Wertproblem in der sozialistischen Gesellschaft (German

et seq.) See now Hayek, Collectivist Economic Planning, London 1935.

PRODUCTION UNDER SOCIALISM
produced a single new argument which I have not already taken
account of. l Nothing has shaken the proof that under Socialism
economic calculation is impossible!
The attempt of the Russian Bolsheviks to transfer Socialism from
a party programme into real life has not encountered the problem
of economic calculation under Socialism, for the Soviet Republics
exist within a world which forms money prices for all means of pro­
duction. The rulers of the Soviet Republics base the calculations on
which they make their decisions on these prices. Without the help of
these prices their actions would be aimless and planless. Only so far
as they refer to this price system, are they able to calculate and keep
books and prepare their plans. Their position is the same as the
position of the state and municipal Socialism of other countries: the
problem of socialist economic calculation has not yet arisen for them.
State and municipal enterpri..ses calculate with those prices of the
means of production and of consumption goods which are formed on
the market. Therefore it would be precipitate to conclude from the
fact that municipal and state enterprises exist, that socialist economic
calculation is possible.
We know indeed that socialist enterprises in single branches of
production are practicable only because of the help they get from
their non-socialist environment. State and municipality can carry
on their own enterprises because the taxes which capitalist enterprises
pay, cover their losses. In a similar manner Russia, which left to
herself would long ago have collapsed, has been supported by finance
from capitalist countries. But incomparably more important than
this material assistance, which the capitalist economy gives to socialist
enterprises, is the mental assistance. Without the basis for calculation
which Capitalism places at the disposal of Socialism, in the shape of
market prices, socialist enterprises would never be carried on, even
within single branches of production or individual countries.

PROBLEM O F E C O N O M I C CALCULAT I O N
Socialist writers may continue to publish books about the decay
of Capitalism and the coming of the socialist millennium: they may
paint the evils of Capitalism in lurid colours and contrast with them
an enticing picture of the blessings of a socialist society; their writings
may continue to impress the thoughtless - but all this cannot alter
the fate of the socialist idea. 1 The attempt to reform the world
socialistically might destroy civilization. It would never set up a
successful socialist community.

§4
The artificial market as the solution of the problem of economic
calculation
Some of the younger socialists believe that the socialist community
could solve the problem of economic calculation by the creation of an
artificial market for the means of production. They adxrJt that it
was an error on the part of the older socialists to have sought to
realize Socialism through the suspension of the market and the
abolition of pricing for goods of higher orders; they hold that it was
an error to have seen in the suppression of the market and of the
price system the essence of the socialistic ideal. And they contend
that if it is not to degenerate into a meaningless chaos in which the
whole of our civilization would disappear, the socialist community
equally with the capitalistic community, must create a market in
which all goods and services may be priced. On the basis of such
arrangements, they think, the socialist community will be able to
make its calculations as easily as the capitalist entrepreneurs.
Unfortunately the supporters of such proposals do not see (or
perhaps will not see) that it is not possible to divorce the market and
its functions in regard to the formation of prices from the working of
a society which is based on private property in the means of produc­
tion and in which, subject to the rules of such a society, the landlords,

the writer deals with the problem of economic calculation quite naively, at first by
asserting that in a socialist society 'the individual enterprises . . . could buy from each
other, just as capitalist enterprises buy from each other' (p. ! ! 4). A few pages on he
explains that 'besides this' the socialist state will 'have to set up a control accountancy
in kind'; the state will be 'the only one able to do this because in contrast to Capitalism
it controls production itself' (p. 122). Landauer cannot understand that - and why ­
one is not permitted to add and subtract figures of different denominations. Such a
case is, of course, beyond help.

PRODUCTION UNDER S O C IALISM
capitalists and entrepreneurs can dispose of their property as they
think fit. For the motive force of the whole process which gives rise

to market prices for the factors of production is the ceaseless search
on the part of the capitalists and the entrepreneurs to maximize their
profits by serving the consumers' wishes. Without the striving of the
entrepreneurs (including the shareholders) for profit, of the landlords
for rent, of the capitalists for interest and the labourers for wages,
the successful functioning of the whole mechanism is not to be
thought of. It is only the prospect of profit which directs production
into those channels in which the demands of the consumer are best
satisfied at least cost. If the prospect of profit disappears the mechan­
ism of the market loses its mainspring, for it is only this prospect which
sets it in motion and maintains it in operation. The market is thus the
focal point of the capitalist order of society; it is the essence of
Capitalism. Only under Capitalism, therefore, is it possible; it cannot

The advocates of the artificial market, however, are of the opinion
that an artificial market can be created by instructing the controllers
of the different industrial units to act as if they were entrepreneurs
in a capitalistic state. They argue that even under Capitalism the
managers ofjoint stock companies work not for themselves but for
the companies, that is to say, for the shareholders. Under Socialism,
therefore, it would be possible for them to act in exactly the same
way as before, with the same circumspection and devotion to duty.
The only difference would be that under Socialism the product of
the manager's labours would go to the community rather than to
the shareholders. In such a way, in contrast to all socialists who
have written on the subject hitherto, especially the Marxians, they
think it would be possible to construct a decentralized, as opposed to
a centralized, Socialism.
In order to judge properly such proposals, it is necessary in the
first place to realize that these controllers of individual industrial
units would have to be appointed. Under Capitalism the managers
of the joint stock companies are appointed either directly or indirectly
by the shareholders. In so far as the shareholders give to the managers
power to produce by the means of the company's (i.e. the share­
holders') stock they are risking their own property or a part of their
own property. The speculation (for it is necessarily a speculation)
ma�T succeed and bring profit; it may, however, misfire and bring
1 38

P R O B L E M O F E C O N O M I C C A L C U LAT I O N
about the loss of the whole or a part of the capital concerned. This
committing of one's own capital to a business whose outcome is un­
certain and to men whose future ability is still a matter of conjecture
whatever one may know of their past, is the essence of joint stock
company enterprise.
Now it is a complete fallacy to suppose that the problem of
economic calculation in a socialist community relates solely to
matters which fall into the sphere of the da1.ily business routine of
managers ofjoint stock companies. It is clear that such a belief can
only arise from exclusive concentration on the idea of a stationary
economic system - a conception which no doubt is useful for the
solution of many theoretical problems but which has no counterpart
in fact and which, if exclusively regarded, can even be positively mis­
leading. It is clear that under stationary conditions the problem of
economic calculation does not really arise. When we think of the
stationary society, we think of an economy in which all the factors
of production are already used in such a way as, under the given
conditions, to provide the maximum of the things which are de­
manded by consumers. That is to say, under stationary conditions
there no longer exists a problem for economic calculation to solve.
The essential function of economic calculation has by hypothesis
already been performed. There is no need for an apparatus of calcu­
lation. To use a popular but not altogether satisfactory terminology
we can say that the problem of economic calculation is of economic
dynamics : it is no problem of economic statics.
The problem of economic calculation is a problem which arises
in an economy which is perpetually subject to change, an economy
which every day is confronted with new problems which have to be
solved. Now in order to solve such problems it is above all necessary
that capital should be withdrawn from particular lines of production,
from particular undertakings and concerns and should be applied in
other lines of production, in other undertakings and concerns. This
is not a matter for the managers ofjoint stock companies, it is essen­
tially a matter for the capitalists - the capitalists who buy and sell
stocks and shares, who make loans and recover them, who make
deposits in the banks and draw them out of the banks again, who
speculate in all kinds of commodities. It is these operations of specu­
lative capitalists which create those conditions of the money market,
the stock exchanges and the wholesale markets which have to be
1 39

PRODUCTION UNDER SOCIALISM
taken for granted by the manager of the joint stock company, who,
according to the socialist writers we are considering, is to be conceived
as nothing but the reliable and conscientious servant of the company.
It is the speculative capitalists who create the data to which he has
to adjust his business and which therefore gives direction to his
trading operations.
It follows therefore that it is a fundamental deficiency of all these
socialistic constructions which invoke the 'artificial market' and
artificial competition as a way out of the problem of economic
calculation, that they rest on the belief that the market for factors of
production is affected only by producers buying and selling com­
modities. It is not possible to eliminate from such markets the influ­
ence of the supply of capital from the capitalists and the demand for
capital by the entrepreneurs, without destroying the mechanism
itself.
Faced with this difficulty, the socialist is likely to propose that the
socialist state as owner of all capital and all means of production
should simply direct capital to those undertakings which promise the
highest return. The available capital, he will contend, should go to
those undertakings which offer the highest rate of profit. But such a
state of affairs would simply mean that those managers who were less
cautious and more optimistic would receive capital to enlarge their
undertakings while more cautious and more sceptical managers
would go away empty-handed. Under Capitalism, the capitalist
decides to whom he will entrust his own capital. The beliefs of the
managers of joint stock companies regarding the future prospects of
their undertakings and the hopes of project-makers regarding the
profitability of their plans are not in any way decisive. The mechan­
ism of the money market and the capital market decides. This
indeed is its main task: to serve the economic system as a whole, to
judge the profitability of alternative openings and not blindly to
follow what the managers of particular concerns, limited by the
narrow horizon of their own undertakings, are tempted to propose.
To understand this completely, it is essential to realise that the
capitalist does not just invest his capital in those undertakings which
offer high interest or high profit; he attempts rather to strike a
balance between his desire for profit and his estimate of the risk of
loss. He must exercise foresight. If he does not do so then he suffers
losses - losses that bring it about that his disposition over the factors
1 40

P R O B L E M O F E C O NO M I C C A L C U L A T I O N
of production is transferrred to the hands of others who know better
how to weigh the risks and the prospects of business speculation.
Now if it is to remain socialistic, the socialist State cannot leave
to other hands that disposition over capital which permits the en­
largement of existing undertakings, the contraction of others and the
bringing into being of undertakings that are completely new. And it
is scarcely to be assumed that socialists of whatever persuasion would
seriously propose that this function should be made over to some
group of people who would 'simply' have the business of doing what
capitalists and speculators do under capitalistic conditions, the only
difference being that the product of their foresight should not belong
to them but to the community. Proposals of this sort may well be
�ade concerning the managers ofjoint stock companies. They can
never be extended to capitalists and speculators, for no socialist
'would dispute that the function which capitalists and speculators
perform under Capitalism, namely directing the use of capital goods
into that direction in which they best serve the demands of the con­
sumer, is only performed because they are under the incentive to pre­
serve their property and to make profits which increase it or at least
allow them to live without diminishing their capital.
It follows therefore that the socialist community can do nothing
but place the disposition over capital in the hands of the State or to
be exact in the hands of the men who, as the governing authority,
carry out the business of the State. And that signifies elimination of
the market, which indeed is the fundamental aim of Socialism, for
the guidance of economic activity by the market implies organization
of production and a distribution of the product according to that
disposition of the spending power of individual members of society
which makes itself felt on the market; that is to say, it implies pre­
cisely that which it is the goal of Socialism to eliminate.
If the socialists attempt to belittle the significance of the problem
of economic calculation in the Socialist community, on the ground
that the forces of the market do not lead to ethically justifiable
arrangements, they simply show that they do not understand the
real nature of the problem. It is not a question of whether there
shall be produced cannons or clothes, dwelling houses or churches,
luxuries or subsistence. In any social order, even under Socialism, it
can very easily be decided which kind and what number of con­
sumption goods should be produced. No one has ever denied that.

141

PRO D U CTION UNDER S O C IALISM
But once this decision has been made, there still remains the problem
of ascertaining how the existing means of production can be used
most effectively to produce these goods in question. In order to solve
this problem it is necessary that there should be economic calcula­
tion. And economic calculation can only take place by means of
money prices established in the market for production goods in a
society resting on private property in the means of production. That
is to say, there must exist money prices of land, raw materials, semi­
manufactures; that is to say, there must be money wages and interest
rates.
Thus the alternative is still either Socialism or a market economy.

§s
Profitability and productivity
The economic activity of the socialist community is subject to the
same external conditions as govern an economic system based on
private property in the means of production or indeed any conceiv­
able economic system. The economic principle applies to it in the
same way as to any and to all economic systems : that is to say it
recognizes an hierarchy of ends, and must therefore strive to achieve
the more important before the less important. This is the essence of
economic activity.
It is obvious that the production activities of the socialist com­
munity will involve not only labour but also material instruments of
production. According to a very widespread custom, these material
instruments of production are called capital. Capitalist production
is that which adopts wise roundabout methods in contrast with a
non-capitalistic production which goes directly to its end in a hand
to mouth manner. 1 If we adhere to this terminology, we must admit
that the socialist community must also work with capital and will
therefore produce capitalistically. Capital conceived as the inter­
mediate products, which arise at the different stages of production by
indirect methods, would not, at any rate at first· be abolished by
1 Bohm-Bawerk, Kapital und Kapitalzins, Vol. 11, 3rd Edition, Innsbruck 1912,
p. 2 1 .
• The limitation comprised in the words 'at first' i s not intended to mean that Social­
ism will later on, say after attaining a 'higher stage of the communist society', inten­
tionally set about abolishing capital in the sense used here. Socialism can never plan
the retum to the life from hand to mouth. Rather do I want to point out here that
Socialism must, by inner necessity, lead to the grsdual consumption of capital.

142

PROF ITABILITY AND PRO D U C T I V ITY
Socialism. It would merely be transferred from individual to com­
mon possession.
But if, as we have suggested above, we wish to understand by
capitalistic production that economic system in which money-cal­
culation is employed, so that we can summarize under the term
capital a set of goods devoted to production and evaluated in terms
of money, and can attempt to estimate the results of economic
activity by the variations in the value of capital, then it is clear that
socialist methods of production cannot be termed capitalistic. In
quite another sense than the Marxians we can distinguish between
socialistic and capitalistic methods of production, and between
Socialism and Capitalism.
The characteristic feature of the capitalistic method of production,
as it appears to socialists, is that the producer works to obtain a profit.
Capitalistic production is production for profit, socialist production
will be production for the satisfaction of needs. That capitalistic
production aims at profit is quite true. But to achieve a profit, that
is a result greater in value than the costs, must also be the aim of the
socialist community. If economic activity is rationally directed, that
is if it satisfies more urgent before less urgent needs, it has already
achieved profits, since the cost, i.e. the value of the most important
of the unsatisfied needs, is less than the result attained. In the
capitalistic system profits can only be obtained if production meets a
comparatively urgent demand. Whoever produces without attending
to the relation between supply and demand fails to achieve the result
at which he is aiming. To direct production towards profit simply
means to direct it to satisfy other people's demand : in this sense it may
be contrasted with isolated man's production for personal needs.
But he also is working for profit in the sense used above. Between
production for profit and production for needs there is no contrast. 1
The contrasting of production for profit and production for needs
is closely connected with the common practice of contrasting pro­
ductivity and profitability or the 'social' and 'private' economic
point of view. An economic action is said to be profitable if in the
capitalist system it yields an excess ofreceipts over costs. An economic
action is said to be productive when, seen from the point of view of
a hypothetical socialist community, the yield exceeds the cost
involved. Now in some cases productivity and profitability do not
1 Pohle-Halm, Kapitalismus und Sozialismus. p.

1 43

12

et seq.

PRODUCTION UNDER SOCIALISM
coincide. Some economic acts which are profitable are not pro­
ductive and, vice versa, some are productive but not profitable. For
those naively biased in favour of Socialism, as is the case even with
most economists, this fact is sufficient to condemn the capitalistic
order of society. Whatever a socialist community would do seems
to them indisputably good and reasonable: that anything different
can happen in a capitalistic society is, in their opinion, an abuse
which cannot be tolerated. But an examination ofthe cases in which
profitability and productivity are alleged not to coincide will show
that this judgment is purely subjective, and that the scientific cloak
with which it is invested is a sham. 1
In the majority of cases in which it is usually assumed that there

is a contrast between profitability and productivity no such contrast
exists. This is true, for example, of profits from speculation. Specula­
tion in the capitalist svstem performs a function which must be oer­
formed in any econorclc system however organized: it provide; for
the adjustment of supply and demand over time and space. The
source of the profit of speculation is enhanced value which is inde­
pendent of any particular form of economic organization. When the
speculator purchases at a low price products which come on the
market in comparatively large quantities and sells them at a higher
price when the demand has again increased, his gains represent, from
a business and from the economic point of view, an increase of value.
That in a socialist order the community and not the individual would
get this much grudged and maligned profit we do not deny. But that
is not the significance of the problem in which we are interested.
The point which concerns us here is that the alleged contrast between
profitability and productivity does not exist in this case. Speculation
performs an economic service which cannot conceivably be elimin­
ated from any economic system. If it is eliminated, as socialists
intend to do, then some other organization must take over its func­
tions: the community itself must become a speculator. Without
speculation there can be no economic activity reaching beyond the
immediate present.
A contrast between orofitabilitv and oroductivitv is sometimes
supposed to be discover�d by picking out a particul�r process and
considering it by itself. People may perhaps characterize as unpro­
ductive certain features peculiar to the constitution of the capitalistic

1 44

GROSS AND NET PRODUCT
organization of industry, e.g. selling expenses, advertising costs and
the like are character�zed as unproductive. This is not legitimate.
We must consider the result of the complete process, not the indi­
vidual stages. We must not consider the constituent expenses without
setting against them the result to which they contribute. 1

§6
Gross and net product
The most ambitious a ttempt to contrast productivity and profit­
ability derives from the examination of the relationship between
gross product and net product. It is clear that every entrepreneur
in the capitalist system aims at achieving the largest net product.
But it is asserted that rightly considered the object of economic
activity should be to achieve not the largest net product but the
largest gross product.
This belief, however, is a fallacy based upon primitive speculations
regarding valuation. But judged by its widespread acceptance even
to-day it is a very popular fallacy. It is implicit when people say that
a certain line of production is to be recommended because it employs
a large number of workers, or when a particular improvement in
production is opposed because it may deprive people of a living.
If the advocates of such views were logical they would have to
admit that the gross product principle applies not only to labour but
also to the material instruments of production. The entrepreneur
carries production up to the point where it ceases to yield a net pro­
duct. Let us assume that production beyond this point requires
material instruments only and not labour. Is it in the interest of
society that the entrepreneur should extend production so as to
obtain a larger gross product? Would society do so if it had the con­
trol of production? Both questions must be answered with a decided

NO.

The fact that further production does not pay shows that the
instruments of production could be applied to a more urgent purpose
in the economic system. If, nevertheless, they are applied to the
unprofitable line then they will be lacking in places where they are
more urgently needed. This is true unde'r both Capitalism and
t

See pp. I 60 et seq., I 83 et seq.
1 45

PRODUCTION UNDER SOC IALISM
Socialism. Even a socialist community, supposing it acted rationally,
would not push certain lines of production indefinitely and neglect
others. Even a socialist community would discontinue a particular
line of production when further production would not cover the
expense, that is to say, at the point where further production would
mean failure to satisfy a more urgent need elsewhere.
But what is true of the increased use of material instruments is
true exactly in the same way of the increased use oflabour. Iflabour
is devoted to a particular line of production to the point where it
only increases the gross product while the net product declines, it is
being withheld from some other line where it could perform more
valuable service. And here, again, the only result of neglecting the
principle of net product is that more urgent wants remain unsatisfied
whilst less urgent ones are met. It is this fact and no other which is
made evident in the mechanism of the capitalist system by the
decline in the net product. In a socialist community it would be the
duty of the economic administration to see that similar misapplica­
tions of economic activity did not occur. Here, therefore, is no dis­
crepancy between profitability and productivity. Even from the
socialist standpoint, the largest possible net product and not the
largest possible gross product must be the aim of economic
activity.
Nevertheless, people continue to maintain the contrary, sometimes
of production in general, sometimes of labour alone and sometimes
of agricultural production. That capitalist activity is directed solely
towards the attainment of the largest net product is adversely
criticized and State intervention is called for to redress the alleged
abuse.
This discussion has a lengthy ancestry. Adam Smith maintained
that different lines of production should be regarded as more or less
productive according to the greater or smaller amount of labour
which they set in motion. 1 For this he was adversely criticized by
Ricardo who pointed out that the welfare of the people increased only
through an enlargement of the net product and !lot of the gross pro­
duct.' For this Ricardo was severely attacked. Even J. B. Say mis­
understood him and accused him of an utter disregard for the welfare

of so many human beings. 1 While Sismondi, who was fond of meet­
ing economic arguments by sentimental declamations, thought he
could dispose of the problem by a witticism: he said that a king who
could produce net product by pressing a button would, according to
Ricardo, make the nation superfluous.' Bernhardi followed Sismondi
on this point.8 Proudhon went as far as to epitomize the contrast
between socialistic and private enterprise in the formula: that
although society must strive for the largest gross product the aim of
the entrepreneur is the largest net product.' Marx avoids committing
himself on this point, but he fills two chapters of the first book of
Das Kapital with a sentimental exposition in which the transition from
intensive to extensive agricultural methods is depicted in the darkest
colour as, in the words of Sir Thomas More, a system 'where sheep
eat up men', and manages in the course of this discussion to confuse
the large expropriations achieved by the political power of the
nobiiity, which characterized European agrarian history in the first
centuries of modern times, with the changes in the methods of cultiva­
tion initiated later on by the landowners.6
Since then declamations on this scheme have formed the stock
equipment of the controversial writings and speeches of the socialists.
A German agricultural economist, Freiherr von der Goltz, has tried
to prove that the attainment of the largest possible gross product is
not only productive from the social point of view but is also profitable
from the individual point of view. He thinks that a large gross pro­
duct naturally presupposes a large net product, and to that extent
the interests of the individuals whose main object is to achieve a large

net product coincide with those of the State which desires a large
gross product. 1 But he can offer no proof of this.
Much more logical than these efforts to overcome the apparent
contrast between social and private interests by ignoring obvious
facts of agricultural accountancy, is the position taken up by followers
of the romantic school of economic thought, particularly the German
etatists, viz. that the agriculturist has the status of a civil servant,
and is therefore obliged to work in the public interest. Since this is
said to require the largest possible gross product it follows that the
farmer, uninfluenced by commercial spirit, ideas or interests, and
regardless of the disadvantages, which may be entailed, must devote
himself to the attainment of this end.3 All these writers take it for
granted that the interests of the community are served by the largest
gross product. But they do not go out of their way to prove it.
When they do try, they only argue from the point of view of Macht­
politik or Nationalpolitik. The State has an interest in a strong agri­
cultural population since the agricultural population is conservative;
agriculture supplies the largest number of soldiers ; provision must
be made for feeding the population in time of war and so on.
In contrast to this an attempt to justify the gross product principle
by economic reasoning has been made by Landry. He will only
admit that the effort to attain the greatest net product is socially ad­
vantageous in so far as the costs which no longer yield a profit arise
from the use of material instruments of production. When the
application of labour is involved he thinks quite otherwise. Then,
from the economic point of view the application of labour costs
nothing: social welfare is not thereby diminished. Wage economies
which result in a diminution of the gross product are harmful.' He
arrives at this conclusion by assuming that the labour force thus
released could find no employment elsewhere. But this is absolutely
wrong. The need of society for labour is never satisfied as long as
labour is not a 'free good'. The released workers find other employ­
ment where they have to supply work more urgent from the economic

contradicts himself in his arllUIIlents. for. to the assertion mentioned above, he adds
immediately: 'Nevertheless the amount remaining as net profit from the gross product
after deducting costs varies considerably. On the average it is greater with extensive
than with intensive cultivation. '

point of view. If Landry were right it would have been better if all
the labour-saving machinery had never existed, and the attitude of
those workers who resist all technical innovations which economize
labour and who destroy such machinery would be j ustified. There is
no reason why there should be a distinction between the employment
of material instruments and of labour. That, in view of the price of
the material instruments and the price of their products, an increase
of production in the same line is not profitable, is due to the fact that
the material instruments are required in some other line to satisfy
more urgent needs. But this is equally true of labour. Workers who
are employed in unprofitably increasing the gross product are with­
held from other lines of production in which they are more urgendy
required. That their wages are too high for an increase in production
involving a larger gross product to be profitable, results indeed from
the fact that the marginal productivity of labour in general is higher
·
than in the particular line of produ ction in ques tion, where it is
applied beyond the limits determined by the net product principle.
There is no contrast whatever here between social and private
interests : a socialist organization would not act differently from an
entrepreneur in the capitalist organization.
Of course there are plenty of other arguments which can be
adduced to show that adherence to the net product principle may be
harmful. They are common to all nationalist-militarist thinking, and
are the well-known arguments used to support every protectionist
policy. A nation must be populous because its political and military
standing in the world depen ds upon numbers. It must aim at
economic self-sufficiency or at least it must produce its food at home
and so on. In the end Landry has to fall back on such arguments to
support his theory. t To examine such arguments would be out of
place in a discussion of the isolated socialist community.
But if the arguments we have examined are untrue it follows that
the socialist community must adopt net product and not gross pro­
duct as the guiding principle of economic activity. The socialist
community equally with the capitalist society will also transform
arable into JUass land. if it is oossible to out more oroductive land

The nature of distribution under Liberalism and Socialism

logical grounds, treatment of the problem of income should
properly come at the end of any investigation into the life of the
socialist community. Production must take place before distribution

is possible, therefore, logically, the former should be discussed before
the latter. But the problem of distribution is so prominent a feature
of Socialism as to suggest the earliest possible discussion of the ques­
tion. For fundamentally, Socialism is nothing but a theory of 'just'
distribution ; the socialist movement is nothing but an attempt to
achieve this ideal. All socialist schemes start from the problem of
distribution and all come back to it. For Socialism the problem of
distribution is the economic problem.
The problem of distribution is moreover peculiar to socialism. It
arises only in a socialist economy. It is true, we are in the habit of
speaking of distribution in an economic society based on private
property, and economic theory deals with the problem of income and
the determination of the prices of the factors of production under the
heading 'Distribution' . This terminology is traditional, and it is so
firmly established that the substitution of another would be unthink­
able. Nevertheless, it is misleading and does not indicate the nature
of the theory which it is meant to describe. Under Capitalism
incomes emerge as a result of market transactions which are
indissolubly linked up with production. We do not first produce
things and afterwards distribute them. When products are supplied
for use and consumption, incomes for the greater part have already
been determined, since they arise during the process of production
and are indeed derived from it. Workers, landowners, and capitalists
and a large number of the entrepreneurs contributing to production
have alre ady received their share before the product is ready for
consumption. The prices which are obtained for the final product
on the market decide only the income which a section ofentrepreneurs
15 1

THE DISTRIBUTION O F I NCOME
obtain from the process of production. (The influence which these
prices have on the income of other classes has already been exerted
via the anticipations of the entrepreneurs.) As thus in the capitalistic
order of society the aggregation of individual incomes to form a total
social income is only a theoretical conception, the concept of distribu­
tion is only figurative. The reason that this expression has been
adopted, instead of the simple and more suitable term formation of
income, is that the founders of scientific economics, the Physiocrats
and the English classical school, only gradually learned to free them­
selves from the etatistic outlook of mercantilism. Although precisely
this analysis of income formation as a result of market transactions
was their principal achievement, they adopted the practice ­
fortunately without any harm to the. content of their teachings - of
grouping the chapters dealing with the different kinds of income
under the heading 'distribution'. 1
Oniy in the sociaiist community is there any distribution of
consumable goods in the true sense of the word. If in considering
capitalistic society we use the term distribution in any but a purely
figurative sense then an analogy is being made between the deter­
mination of income in a socialist and in a capitalist community. The
conception of any actual process of distribution of income must be
kept out of any investigation of the mechanism of capitalist society.

§2
The social dividend
According to the fundamental idea of Socialism only goods which
are ripe for consumption are eligible for distribution. Goods of a
higher order remain the property of the community for purposes of
further production; they must not be distributed. Goods of the
first order, on the contrary, are without exception destined to be
distributed : they constitute indeed the net social dividend. Since in
considering the socialist society we cannot quite get rid ofideas which
are only appropriate to the capitalist order, it is usual to say that the
society will retain a part of the consumers' goods for public consump­
tion. We are really thinking of that part of consumption which in the
capitalistic society is usually called public expenditure. Where the

THE S OC IAL DIVIDEND
principle of private property is rigidly applied this public expenditure
consists exclusively of the cost of maintaining the apparatus which
assures the undisturbed course of things. The only task of the strictly
Liberal state is to secure life and property against attacks both from
external and internal foes. It is a producer of security, or, as Lassalle
moc
gly termed it, a night watchman's state. In a socialist com­
munity there will be the corresponding task of securing the socialist
order and the peaceful course of socialistic production. Whether the
apparatus of coercion and violence which serves this purpose will
still be known as the state or be called by some other name, and
whether it will be legally given a separate status among the other
functions incumbent upon the socialist community, is a matter of
complete indifference to us. We have only to make it clear that all
expenditure devoted to this end will appear in the socialist com­
munity as general costs of production. So far as they involve the use
oflabour for the purposes of distributing the social dividend, they must
be reckoned in such a way that the workers employed get their share.
But public expenditure includes other outlays. Most states and
municipalities provide their citizens with certain utilities in kind,
sometimes gratuitously, -sometimes at a charge which covers only a
part of the expense. As a rule this happens in the case of single
services which are yielded by durable commodities. Thus parks, art
galleries, public libraries, places of worship, are made available for
those who wish to use them. Similarly, roads and streets are accessible
to everyone. Moreover, direct distribution of consumption goods
takes place, as for example, when medicine and diet are given to the
sick and educational apparatus to pupils ; personal service is also
supplied when medical treatment is given. All this is not Socialism,
it is not production on the basis of common ownership of the means
of production. Distribution, indeed, occurs here, but what is

kip

distributed is first collected by taxation from the citizens. Only so far
as this distribution deals with products of state or municipal produc­
tion cafl it be described as a piece of Socialism within the framework
of an otherwise liberal order of society. We need not stop to inquire
hov' far this branch of state and municipal activity is due to views
which have been influenced by the socialist critics of capitalist
society and how far it is due to the special nature of certain particu­
larly durable consumption goods which yield almost unlimited
service. For us it is only important that in the case of this public

1 53

THE DI STRIBUTION OF INCOME
expenditure, even in an otherwise capitalistic society, a distribution
in the actual sense of the word takes place.
Moreover, the socialist community will not make a physical
distribution of all consumers' goods. It is not likely to present a copy
of every new book to every citizen, but rather to place the books in
public reading rooms for the general use. It will do the same with its
schools and teaching, its public gardens, playgrounds and asSembly
halls. The expenditure which all these arrangements necessitate is
not deducted from the social dividend; on the contrary, it is a part
of the social dividend.
This part of the social dividend exhibits this one peculiarity, that
without prejudice to the principles which determine the distribution
of consumable consumers' goods and part of durable goods, special
principles of distribution can be applied to it corresponding to the
special nature of the services involved. The way in which art col­
lections and scientific publications are made available for general use
is quite independent of the rules which are otherwise applied to the
distribution of goods of the first order.

§3
The principles of distribution
The socialist community is characterized by the fact that in it
there is no connection between production and distribution. The
magnitude of the share which is assigned for the use of each citizen
is quite independent of the value of the service he renders. It would
be fundamentally impossible to base distribution on the imputation of
value because it is an essential feature of socialistic methods of
production that the shares of the different factors of production in
the result cannot be ascertained; and any arithmetical test of the
relations between effort and result is impossible.
It would therefore not be possible to base even a part of distribu­
tion on an economic calculation of the contribution of the dftferent
factors, e.g. by first granting the worker the full product ofhis labour
which under the capitalist system he would receive in the form of
wages, and then applying a special form of distribution in the case of
the shares which are attributed to the material factors of production
and to the work of the entrepreneur. On the whole socialists lack
any clear conception of this fact. But a faint suspicion of them
1 54

PRINC I PLES OF D I STRIBUTION
pervades the Marxian d octrine that under S ocialism the categ ories
wages, pr ofit, and rent w ould be unthinkable.
There are four different principles up on which s ocialistic distribu­
ti on can c onceivably be based : equal distributi on per head, distribu­
tion acc ording t o service rendered to the c ommunity, distributi on
acc ording t o needs, and distributi on acc ording t o merit. These
principles can be c ombined in different ways.
The principle of equal distributi on derives fr om the old d octrine
of natural law of the equality of all human beings. Rigidly applied it
w ould pr ove absurd. It w ould permit n o distincti on between adults
and children, between the sick and the healthy, between the
industri ous and the lazy, or between g o od and bad. It c ould be
applied only in c ombinati on with the other three principles of
distributi on. It w ould at least be necessary t o take int o acc ount the
principle of distributi on acc ording t o needs, s o that shares might be
graded acc ording t o age, sex, health and special occupati onal needs ;
it w ould be necessary t o take int o acc ount the principle of distributi on
acc ording t o services rendered, s o that distincti on c ould be made
between industri ous and less industri ous, and between g o od and
bad w orkers ; and finally, s ome acc ount w ould have t o be taken of
merit, s o as t o make reward or punishment effective. But even if the
principle of equal distributi on is m odified in these ways the dif­
ficulties of s ocialistic distributi on are n ot rem oved. In fact, these
difficulties cann ot be overc ome at all.
We have already sh own the difficulties raised by applying the
principle of distributi on acc ording t o value of services rendered. I n
the capitalist system the ec on omic subject receives a n inc ome
c orresp onding t o the value of his c ontributi on t o the general pr ocess
of pr oducti on. Services are rewarded acc ording to their value. It is
precisely this arrangement which S ocialism wishes t o change and t o
replace by one under which the shares attributed t o the material
fact ors of pr oducti on and t o the entrepreneur w ould be s o distributed
that n o pr operty owner and n o entrepreneur w ould have a standing
fundamentally different fr om that of the rest of the c ommunity. But
this inv olves a c omplete div orce of distributi on fr om ec on omic
imputati on of value. I t has n othing t o d o with the value of the
individual's service t o the c ommunity. It c ould be br ought int o
e,:ternal relati on with the service rendered only if the service of the
individual were made the basis of distributi on acc ording t o s ome

1 55

THE DISTRIBUT I ON OF I NCOME
external criteria. The most obvious criterion appears to be the
number of hours worked. But the significance to the social dividend
of any service rendered is not to be measured by the length of
working time. For, in the first place, the value of the service differs
according to its use in the economic scheme. The results will differ
according to whether the service is used in the right place, that is to
say, where it is most urgently required, or in the wrong place. In
the socialist organization, however, the worker cannot be made
ultimately responsible for this, but only those who assign him the
work. Secondly, the value of the service varies according to the
quality of the work and according to the particular capability of the
worker; it varies according to his strength and his zeal. It is not
difficult to find ethical reasons for equal payments to workers of
unequal capabilities. Talent and genius are the gifts of God, and the
individual is not responsible for them, as is often said. But this does
not solve the problem whether it is expedient or practicable to pay
all hours of labour the same price.
The third principle of distribution is according to needs. The
formula of each according to his needs is an old slogan of the un­
sophisticated communist. It is occasionally backed up by referring to
the fact that the Early Christians shared all goods in common. 1
Others again regard it as practicable because it is supposed to form
the basis of distribution within the family. No doubt it could be made
universal if the disposition of the mother, who hungers gladly rather
than that her children should go without, could be made universal.
The advocates of the principle of distribution according to needs
overlook this. They overlook much more besides. They overlook the
fact that so long as any kind of economic effort is necessary only a
part of our needs can be satisfied, and a part must remain unsatisfied.
The principle of to each according to his needs remains meaningless
so long as it is not defined to what extent each indivdual is allowed
to satisfy his needs. The formula is illusory since everyone has to
forego the complete satisfaction of all his needs! It could indeed be

See Pecqueur's criticism of this formula of distribution (Theorie nouvelle d'Economie
sociale et politique, Paris 1 842, p. 613 et seq.). Pecqueur shows himself superior to Marx,
who unhesitatingly indulges in the illusion that • In a higher stage of the communist
society . . . the narrow bourgeois legal horizon could be completely surpassed and
society could write on its banners: From each according to his abilities, to each accord­
ing to his needs I' Marx, Zur Kritik des so:naldemokratuchen Parteiprogramml t'on

S

PROCESS OF DISTRIBUTION
applied within narrow limits. The sick and suffering can be assigiled
special medicine, care, and attendance, better attention and special
treatment for their special needs, without making this consideration
for exceptional cases the general rule.
Similarly it is quite impossible to make the merit of the individual
the general principle of distribution. Who is to decide on merits?
Those in power have often had very strange views on the merits or
demerits of their contemporaries. And the voice of the people is
not the voice of God. Who would the people choose to-day as the
best of their contemporaries? It is not unlikely that the choice would
fall on a film star, or perhaps on a prize-fighter. To-day the English
people would probably be inclined to call Shakespeare the greatest
Englishman. Would his contemporaries have done so? And how
would they esteem a second Shakespeare if he were among them
to-day? Moreover, why should those be penalized in whose lap
Nature has not placed the great gifts of talent and genius? Distribu­
tion according to the merits of the individual would open the door
wide to mere caprice and leave the individual defenceless before the
oppression of the majority. Conditions would be created which
would make life unbearable.
As far as the economics of the problem are concerned it is a
matter of indifference which principle or which combination of
different principles is made a basis for distribution. Whatever
principle is adopted the fact remains that each individual will
receive an allocation from the community. The citizen will receive
a bundle of claims which can be exchanged within a certain time for
a definite amount of different goods. In this way he will procure his
daily meals, fixed shelter, occasional pleasures, and from time to
time new clothing. Whether the satisfaction of needs which he
obtains in this way is great or small will depend upon the productivity
of the efforts of the community.

§4
The process of distribution
It is not necessary that each individual should himself consume
the whole share allotted to him. He can let some go to waste, give
some away, or, as far as the commodity permits, put some aside for

1 57

THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME
later consumption. Some, moreover, h e can exchange. The beer
drinker will readily forgo his share of non-alcoholic drink to obtain
more beer. The abstainer will be prepared to forgo his claim to
spirits if he can acquire other commodities instead. The aesthete
will surrender a visit to the cinema for the sake of more opportunities
to hear good music; the lowbrow will willingly exchange tickets to
art galleries for more congenial pleasures. Everyone will be ready
to exchange, but the exchange will be confined to consumers' goods.
Producers' goods will be res extra commercium.
Such exchange, need not be confined to direct barter: it can also
take place indirectly within certain narrow limits. The same reasons
which have led to indirect exchange in other types of society will
make it advantageous to those exchanging in the socialistic com­
munity. It follows that even here there will be opportunity for the
use of a general medium of exchange - money.
The role of money in the socialist economy will be fundamentally
the same as in a free economic system - that of a general facilitator
of exchange. But the significance of this role will be quite different.
In a society based on the collective ownership of the means of pro­
duction, the significance of the role of money will be incomparably
narrower than in a society based on private property in the means of
production. For in the socialist commonwealth, exchange itselfhas a
much narrower significance, since it is confined to consumers' goods
only. There cannot be money prices of producers' goods since these
do not enter into exchange. The accounting function which money
exercises in production in a free economic ord er will no longer exist
in a socialist community. Money calculations of value will be
impossible.
Nevertheless the central administration of production and distri­
bution cannot leave out of consideration the exchange relations which
arise in this sort of traffic. Clearly it would have to take them into
account if it desired to make different commodities mutually
substitutable when assessing the distribution of the social dividend.
Thus if in the process of exchange the relation of one cigar to five
cigarettes was established, the administration could not arbitrarily
lay it down that one cigar equalled three cigarettes, so that it might
be able on this basis to give one individual only cigars and another
only cigarettes. If the tobacco allowance has not been equally
distributed, partly in cigars and partly in cigarettes, that is to say, if
1 58

PR O C E S S O F D I STR I B U T I O N
some - either according to their wishes or by order of the govern­
ment - received only cigars and others only cigarettes, the exchange
relations already established could not be ignored. Otherwise all
those who received cigarettes would be unfairly treated, compared
with those receiving cigars, since the person who had received a
cigar could exchange it for five cigarettes whilst he had obtained it
as the equivalent of three cigarettes.
Alterations of exchange relationships in this traffic among the
citizens would consequently compel the administration to make
corresponding changes in the substitution ratios of the various
commodities. Every such change will indicate that the relations
between the various needs of the citizens and their satisfaction had
altered, that people now wanted some commodities more than
before, others less. The economic administration would presumably
endeavour to adjust production to this change. It would endeavour
to produce more of the more desired commodity and less of the less
desired. But one thing, however, it would not be able to do: it would
not be able to permit the individual citizens to redeem their tobacco
tickets arbitrarily in cigars or cigarettes. If individuals were allowed
free choice of cigars or cigarettes they might demand more cigars or
more cigarettes than had been produced, or, on the other hand
cigars or cigarettes might be left on hand at the distributing centres
because no one demanded them.
The labour theory of value appears to offer a simple solution of
this problem. For an hour of labour a citizen receives a token which
entitles him to the product of one hour of labour, with a deduction to
defray the general obligations of the community, e.g. support of the
disabled, expenditure on cultural purposes. Allowing for this
deduction to cover the expenditure borne by the community as a
whole, every worker who has worked one hour will have the right
to obtain products on which one hour of labour has been expended.
Any one who is ready to pay by giving to the community his own
working time corresponding to the working time used to produce
them can draw from the supply centres consumers' goods and services
and apply them to his own use.
But such a principle of distribution would not work, since labour
is not uniform or homogeneous. There are qualitative differences
between the different forms of labour which, taken in conjunction
with variations in the supply and demand of the resulting products,

'59

THE D ISTRIBUTION OF INCOME
lead to different values. Ceteris paribus the supply of pictures cannot
be increased without the quality of the work suffering. The worker
who has supplied an hour of simple labour cannot be granted the
right to consume the product of an hour of work of a higher quality:
and it would be impossible in a socialist community to establish any
connection between the importance of work done for the community
and the share in the yield of communal production given for the work.
Payment for work would be quite arbitrary. For the methods of
calculating value used in a free economic society based on private
ownership of the means of production would be inaccessible to it since,
as we have seen, such imputation is impossible in a socialistic society.
Economic facts would clearly limit the power of society to reward
the labourer arbitrarily; in the long run the wage total can in no
circumstances exceed the income of society. Within this limit,
however, the community is free to act. It can decide to pay all work
equally, regardless of quality; it can just as easily make a distinction
between the various hours of work, according to the quality of the
work rendered. But in both cases it must reserve the right to decide
the particular distribution of the products.
Even if we abstract from differences in the quality of labour and
its product and accept the possibility of determining how much
labour inheres in any product, the community would never allow the
individual who had rendered an hour of labour to consume the
product of an hour's labour. For all economic goods entail material
costs apart from labour. A product for which more raw material is
required must not be made equivalent to a product requiring less
raw material.

§5
The costs of distribution
Socialistic criticism of the capitalist system devotes much space
to complaints about the high costs of what can be called the
apparatus of distribution. They include under this the costs of all
national and political institutions, including expenditure on military
purposes and war. They also include the expense to society arising
from free competition. All the expenditure on advertisement and the
activities of persons involved in the competitive struggle such as
agents, commercial travellers, etc., and the costs entailed by the
1 60

COSTS OF

DISTRIBUTI ON

efforts of firms to remain independent instead of amalgamating into
larger units or joining cartels which make possible specialization and
thereby the cheapening of production, are debited to the distributive
process of the capitalist system. The socialistic society will, so the
critics think, save enormously by putting an end to this waste.

The expectation that the socialist community will save that
outlay which can properly be termed state expenditure is derived
from the doctrine, peculiar to many anarchists and to Marxian
socialists, that state compulsion would be superfluous in a society
not based on private property in the means of production. They
argue that in the socialist community 'obedience to the simple
fundamental rules governing any form of social life will very soon
become of necessity a habit', but this is backed up by a hint that
'evasion of regulation and control enforced by the whole people will
undoubtedly be enormously difficult', and will incur 'swift and
severe punishment', since 'the armed workers' wouid not be
'sentimental intellectuals' nor 'let themselves be mocked'. 1 All
this is merely playing with words. Control, Arms, Punishment, are
not these 'a special repressive authority', and thus according to
Engel's own words a 'State'?' Whether the compulsion is exercised by
armed workers - who cannot work while they bear arms - or by the
workers' sons clad in police uniforms, will make. no difference to the
costs which the compulsion entails.
But the State is a coercive apparatus not only to its own
inhabitants: it applies coercion externally. Only a state comprising
the whole universe would need to exert no external coercion and
then only because in that event there would be no foreign land, no
foreigners and no foreign states. Liberalism, with its fundamental
antagonism to warfare, wants to give the whole world some state form
of organization. If this can be achieved it is inconceivable without a
coercive apparatus. If all the armies of the individual states were
abolished we could not dispense with a world apparatus of coercion,
a world police to ensure world peace. Whether Socialism unites all
states into a single one or whether it leaves them independent of
each other, in any case it too will not be able to do without a coercive
apparatus.
The socialist apparatus of coercion too will entail some expense.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME
Whether this will be greater or less than the expense of the state
apparatus of the capitalist society naturally we cannot say. We
merely need to see that the social dividend will be reduced by the
amount involved.
As for the wastes of distribution under Capitalism, little need be
said. Since in capitalist society there is no distribution in the real
sense of the word there are no costs of distribution. Trading expenses
and similar costs cannot be called distribution costs, not only because
they are not the costs of a distribution, which is a special process in
itself, but also because the effects of the services devoted to these
purposes extend far beyond the mere distribution of goods. Competi­
tion is not confined to distribution: that is only a part of its service. It
serves equally the process of production, indeed it is essential for any
organization of production which is to ensure high productivity. It
is not enough therefore to compare these costs with the costs incurred
by the apparatus of distribution and management in a socialist
community. If socialist methods of production reduce productivity
- and we shall speak of this later - it matters little that it saves the
work of commercial travellers, brokers and advertisers.

Stationary conditions

o assume stationary economic conditions is a theoretical expedient
T and not an attempt to describe reality. We cannot dispense with this
line of thought if we wish to understand the laws of economic change.
In order to study movement we must first imagine a condition where
it does not exist. The stationary condition is that point of equilibrium
to which we conceive all forms of economic activity to be tending
and which would actually be attained if new factors did not, in the
meantime, create a new point of equilibrium. In the imaginary
state of equilibrium all the units of the factors of production are
employed in the most economic way, and there is no reason to
contemplate any changes in their number or their disposition.
Even if it is impossible to imagine a living - that is to say a
changing socialist economic order, because economic activity
without economic calculation seems inconceivable, it is quite easy to
postulate a socialist economic order under stationary conditions. We
need only avoid asking how this stationary condition is achieved.
If we do this there is no difficulty in examining the statics of a
socialist community. All socialist theories and Utopias have always
had only the stationary condition in mind.

§2
The disutilities and satisfactions of labour
Socialist writers depict the socialist community as a land of
heart's desire. Fourier;s sickly fantasies go farthest in this direction.
In Fourier's state of the future all harmful beasts will have dis­
appeared, and in their places will be animals which will assist man in
his labours - or ev�n do his work for him. An anti-beaver will see to
1 63

THE S O C IA L I ST C O M MUN ITY

the fishing; an anti-whale will move sailing ships in a calm ; an anti­
hippopotamus will tow the river boats. Instead of the lion there will
be an anti-lion, a steed of wonderful swiftness, upon whose back the
rider will sit as comfortably as in a well-sprung carriage. 'It will be
a pleasure to live in a world with such servants.' 1 Godwin even thought
that men might be immortal after property had been abolished. 2
Kautsky tells us that under the socialist society 'a new type of man
will arise . . . a superman . . . an exalted man." Trotsky provides
even more detailed information: 'Man will become incomparably
stronger, wiser, finer. His body more harmonious, his movements
more rhythmical, his voice more musical . . . The human average
will rise to the level of an Aristotle, a Goethe, a Marx. Above these
other heights new peaks will arise." And writers of this sort of stuff
are continually being reprinted and translated into other tongues,
and made the subject of exhaustive historical theses !
Other socialist writers are more circumspect in their pronounce­
ments but they proceed on essentially similar assumptions. Tacitly
underlying Marxian theory is the nebulous idea that the natural
factors of production are such that they need not be economized.
Such a conclusion indeed follows inevitably from a system that
reckons labour as the only element in costs, that does not accept the
law of diminishing returns, rejects the Malthusian law of population
and loses itself in obscure fantasies about the unlimited possibility of
increasing productivity.' We need not go further into these matters.
It is sufficient to recognize that even in a socialist community the
natural factors of production would be limited in quantity and
would therefore have to be economized.
The second element which would have to be economized is
labour. Even if we ignore differences in quality it is obvious that

labour is available only to a limited extent: the individual can only
perform a certain amount of labour. Even if labour were a pure
pleasure it would have to be used economically, since human life is
limited in time, and human energy is n o t inexhaustible. Even the
man who lives at his leisure, untramelled by monetary considerations,
has to dispose of his time, i.e. choose between different possible ways
of spending it.
It is clear therefore, that in the world as we know it, human
behaviour must be governed by economic considerations. For while
our wants are unlimited, the goods of the first order bestowed by
nature are scarce; and, with a given productivity of labour, goods of
a higher order can serve to increase the satisfaction of needs only by
increasing labour. Now, quite apart from the fact that labour cannot
be increased beyond a certain point, an increase of labour is accom­
panied by increasing disutility.
Fourier and his school regard the disutility of labour as a result
of perverse social arrangements. These alone in their view are to
blame for the fact that in accepted usage the words 'labour' and
'toil' are synonymous . Labour in itself is not unpleasant. On the
contrary, all men need to be active. Inactivity entails intolerable
boredom. If labour is to be made attractive it must be carried on in
healthy, clean workplaces; the joy of labour must be aroused by a
happy feeling of union among the workers and cheerful competition
between them. The chief cause of the repugnance which labour
arouses is its continuity. Even pleasures pall if they last too long.
Therefore the workers must be allowed to interchange their occupa­
tions at will ; work will then be a pleasure and no longer create
aversion. 1
It is not difficult to expose the error contained in this argument,
though it is accepted by socialists of all schools. Man feels the impulse
to activity. Even if need did not drive him to work he would not
always be content to roll in the grass and bask in the sun. Even young
animals and children whose nourishment is provided by their
parents kick their limbs, dance, jump and run so as to exercise powers
yet unclaimed by labour. To be stirring is a physical and mental
need. Thus, in general, purposeful labour gives satisfaction. Yet

diagram the line 0 x along which the product of labour is measured,
marks the dividing line between the disutility of labour and the
satisfaction the exercise of our powers affords, which may be called
immediate satisfaction due to labour. The curve, a, b, c, P represents
labour disutility and immediate labour satisfaction in relation to the
product. When labour commences it is found disagreeable. Mter the
first difficulties have been overcome and body and mind are better
adapted, then the disagreeableness declines. At b neither dis­
agreeableness nor satisfaction predominates. Between b and c direct
satisfaction prevails. After c disagreeableness recommences. With
other forms of labour the curve may run differently, as in 0 cl Pt or

o h. That depends on the nature of the work and the personality
of the workers. It is different for navvies and for jockeys : it is different
for dull and for energetic men. 1
Why is labour continued when the disutility which its con­
tinuance occasions exceeds the direct satisfaction deriving from it?
Because something else beside direct labour satisfaction comes into
account, namely the satisfaction afforded by the product of the
labour; we call this indirect labour satisfaction. Labour will be
continued so long as the dissatisfaction which it arouses is counter­
balanced by the pleasure derived from its product. Labour will
only be discontinued at the point at which its continuation would
give rise to more disutility than utility.
The methods by which Fourier wished to deprive labour of its
unattractiveness were indeed based upon correct observations, but
he greatly overrated the bearing of his argument.
It is clear

that the amount of work which affords direct labour satis­
faction supplies such a small fraction of the needs which men
consider imperative that they readily undergo the hardship of
performing irksome work. But it is a mistake to assume that any
significant change would take place if workers were allowed to change
occupations at short intervals. For in the first place the product of
labour would be reduced because of the diminished skill acquired
by the individual as a result of diminished practice in each of his
various occupations; also because every change over would cause
loss of time, and labour would be expended in the shuffling. And in
the second place only a very slight part of the excess of labour dis­
utility over direct labour satisfaction is due to weariness with the
particular job in hand. Hence the capacity to derive direct satisfac­
tion from another form oflabour is not what it would have been if the
first job had not been performed. Clearly the greater part of the
disutiHty is due to general fatigue of the organism and to a desire to
be released from any further constraint. The man who has worked
for hours at a desk will prefer to chop wood for an hour rather than
spend another hour at the desk. But what made his labour un­
pleasant was not only the need for change but rather the length of
the work. If the product is not to be diminished the length of the
working day can be reduced only by increased productivity. The
widespread opinion that there is labour which only tires the body and
labour which only tires the mind is incorrect, as everyone can prove
for himself. All labour affects the whole organism. We deceive our­
selves on this point because in observing other forms of occupation
we see only the direct labour satisfaction. The clerk envies the
coachman, because he would like a little recreation in driving: but
his envy would last only as long as the satisfaction exceeded the pain.
Similarly hunting and fishing, mountain climbing, riding and
driving are undertaken for sport. But sport is not work in the
economic sense. It is the hard fact that men cannot subsist on the
small amount of labour yielding direct labour satisfaction which
compels them to suffer the irksomeness of toil, not the bad organiza­
tion of labour.
It is obvious, that improvements in the conditions under which
labour is performed may increase the product with unchanged
irksomeness or lessen the irksomeness for the same product. But it
would be impossible to improve these conditions more than actually

occurs under capitalism without rising ccst. That labour is less
irksome when performed in company has been known from of old,
and where it seems possible to let workers work together without
reducing output, it is done.
There are, of course, exceptional natures that rise above the
common level. The great creative genius who perpetuates himself in
immortal works and deeds does not when working distinguish the
pain from the pleasure. For such men creation is at once the greatest
joy and the bitterest torment, an inner necessity. What they create
has no value to them as a product : they create for the sake of creation,
not for the result. The product costs them nothing because, when
working, they forego nothing dearer to them than their work. And
their product only costs society what they could have produced by
other labour. In comparison to the value of the service this cost is
nothing. Genius is truly a gift of God.
Now the life history of great men is familiar to all. Thus the
social reformer is easily tempted to regard what he has heard of
them as common attributes. We continually find people inclined to
regard the mode of life of the genius as the typical way of living of a
simple citizen of a socialist community. But not everyone is a
Sophocles or a Shakespeare, and standing behind a lathe is not the
same thing as writing Goethe's poems or founding the Empire of
Napoleon.
It is therefore easy to see the nature of the illusions entertained by
Marxians with regard to the satisfactions and toil of the inhabitants
of the socialist community. Here, as in everything else it has to say
about the socialist community, Marxism moves along the lines set
out by the Utopians. With express reference to Fourier's and Owen's
ideas of restoring to work 'the attractiveness lost through division of
labour', by arranging for each form of work to be performed for a
short time only, Engels sees in Socialism an organization of produc­
tion 'in which productive labour will be not a means for enslaving
but for liberating mankind, which will give every individual the
opportunity to develop and to exercise all his capabilities, bodily and
mentai, in an directions, and win transform a bane into a boon'. i
And Marx talks of 'a higher phase ofcommunist society after having
done away with the slavish subjection of the individual under the
division of labour, a society in which the contrast between mental

and physical work has disappeared' and 'labour has become not only
a means of life but the first need of life itself. ' 1 Max Adler promises
that the socialist society will 'at the very least' not assign to anyone
any work 'which must cause him pain' .· These statements distin­
guish themselves from the utterances of Fourier and his school only
by the fact that there is nowhere any attempt to provide them with a
basis of proof.
Fourier and his school, however, had another device, apart from
changes of occupation, for rendering work more attractive : com­
petition. Men would be capable of the highest achievement if in­
spired by un sentiment de rivalitl joyeuse ou de noble emulation.
Here for once they recognize the advantages of competition, which
everywhere else they describe as pernicious. If the workers show a
deficiency in achievement it will be sufficient to divide them into
groups : immediately a fierce competition will blaze up between the
groups, '\vhich ,viII double the energy of the individual and suddenly
arouse in all un acharnement passione au travail.3
The observation that competition makes for greater accomplish­
ment is of course correct enough, but it is superficial. Competition
is not in itself a human passion. The efforts put forth by men in
competition are not made for the sake of the competition but for the
end attained thereby. The fight is waged not for its own sake, but
for the prize which beckons the victor. But what prizes would spur
to emulation the workers in a socialist community? Experience
shows that titles and rewards of honour are not estimated too highly.
Material goods to increase the satisfaction of wants could not be
given as prizes since the principle of distribution would be inde­
pendent of individual performance, and the increase per head
through the increased effort of a single worker would be so insignifi­
cant that it would not count. The simple satisfaction from duty per­
formed would not suffice: it is precisely because this incentive cannot
be trusted that we seek others. And even if it were so, labour
would still be irksome. It would not thereby become attractive in
itself.
The Fourier school, as we have seen, regards it as the main point of
their solution of the social problem that w ork will be made a joy

instead of a toil. 1 But unfortunately the means which it provides
for this are quite impracticable. If Fourier had really been able to
show the way to make work attractive he would have deserved the
divine honours bestowed on him by his followers. 2 But his much
lauded doctrines are nothing but the fantasies of a man who was
incapable of seeing clearly the world as it really is.
Even in a socialist community work will arouse feelings of pain
and not of pleasure. a

The 'joy of labour'
It: this is recognized, one of the main supports of socialist structure
of thought collapses. It is therefore only too easy to understand why
socialists try stubbornly to maintain that there is in man an innate
impulse and striving to work, that work gives satisfaction per se and
that only the unsatisfactory conditions under which work is per­
formed in capitalist society could restrict this natural joy of labour
and transform it into toil.'
1 Considerant, Studien rJber einige Fundamentalprobleme der sozialen Zukunft (con­
tained in Fourier's System del' sozialen Reform, translated by Kaatz, Leipzig 1 906),
p. 55 et seq. Fourier has the distinction of having introduced the fairies into social
science. In his future state the children, organized in 'Petites Hordes', will perform
what the adults do not do. To them will be entrusted, amongst other things, mainten­
ance of the roads. 'C'est a leur amour propre que I'Harmonie sera redevable d'avoir,

the morning they are up, cleaning the stables, attending to the cattle and horses, and
working in the slaughter houses, where they take care that no animal is ever treated
cruelly, killing always in the most humane manner. 'Elles ont la haute police du
regne animal. ' When their work is done they wash themselves, dress themselves, and
appear triumphantly at the breakfast table. See Fourier, Oeuvres completes, Vol. V,

and Victor Hugo also venerated Fourier. The first dedicated to him a poem, re­
printed in Bebel (Charles Fourier, Stuttgart 1 890, p. 294 et seq.).
3 Socialist writers are still far from knowing this. Kautsky (Die soziale Revolution,
11, p. 16 et seq.) considers that the main task of a proletarian regime is 'to make work,
which to-day is a burden, into a pleasure, so that people will enjoy working and the
workers go joyfully to work'. He admits that 'this is not such a simple matter' and
concludes that 'it will hardly be possible to make work in factories and mines attractive
quickly'. But he cannot naturally bring himself to abandon completely Socialism's
fundamental illusion.

'J O Y

OF

LABOUR'

In proof of this assertion they assiduously collect statements made
by workers in modern factories on the pleasurability of the labour.
They ask the workers leading questions and are extraordinarily
satisfied when the answers are of the kind they want to hear. But
because of their prepossession they omit to notice that between the
actions and replies of those whom they cross-examine there is a
contradiction which demands solution. If work gives satisfaction
per se why is the worker paid? Why does he not reward the employer
for the pleasure which the employer gives him by allowing him to
work? Nowhere else are people paid for the pleasure given to them,
and the fact that pleasures are rewarded ought at least to give pause
for reflection. By common definition, labour cannot give satisfaction
directly. We define labour as just that activity which does not give
any direct pleasurable sensations, which is performed only because
the produce of the labour yields indirectly pleasurable sensations
sufficient to counterbaiance the primary sensations of pain. 1
The so-called 'joy of labour' which is generally adduced in
support of the view that labour awakens feelings of satisfaction, not of
pain, is attributable to three quite separate sensations.
There is first the pleasure which can be obtained from the per­
version of work. When the public official abuses his office, often
while performing his function in a manner which is formally quite
correct, so as to satisfy the instincts of power, or to give free rein to
sadistic impulses, or to pander to erotic lusts (and in this one need
not always think merely of things condemned by law or morals) , the
pleasures that follow are undoubtedly not pleasures of work but
pleasures derived'from certain accompanying circumstances. Similar
considerations apply also to other kinds of work. Psycho-analytic
literature has repeatedly pointed out how extensively matters of this
sort influence the choice of occupation. In so far as these pleasures
counterbalance the pain of labour they are reflected also in the rates
of pay; the larger supply of labour in the occupations offering the
greatest scope for this kind of perversion tending to lower the rate
of pay. The worker pays for the 'pleasure' with an income lower
than he otherwise could have earned.
By 'joy of labour' people mean also the satisfaction of completing
a task. But this is pleasure in being free of work rather than pleasure
1 We here disregard the above-mentioned pleasure in beginning work, in practice
unimportant. See p. 166.

THE SOCIALIST COMMUNITY
in the work itself.

Here we have a special kind of pleasure, which

can be shown to exist everywhere, in having got rid of something
difficult, unpleasant, painful, the pleasure of 'I've done it' . Socialist
Romanticism and romantic socialists praise the Middle Ages as a
time when joy oflabour was unrestricted. As a matter offact we have
no reliable information from medieval artisans, peasants, and their
assistants about the 10y of labour', but we may presume that their
joy was in having performed their work and begun the hours of
pleasure and repose. Medieval monks, who in the contemplative
peace of their monasteries copied manuscripts, have bequeathed us
remarks which are certainly more genuine and reliable than the
assertions of our romantics.

At the end of many a fine manuscript

we read :

Laus tibi sit Christe, quoniam liber explicit iste. 1 Thus :
Praise the Lord because the work is completed. Not because the work
itself has given pleasure.
But we must not forget the third and most important source of
the joy of labour - the satisfaction the worker feels because his work
goes so well that through it he can earn a living for himself and his
family. This joy of labour is clearly rooted in the pleasure of what we
have called the indirect enjoyment of labour. The worker rejoices
because in his ability to work and in his skill he sees the basis of his
existence and of his social position. He rejoices because he has
attained a position better than that of others. He rejoices because he
sees in his ability to work the guarantee of future economic success.
He is proud because he can do something 'good', that is, something
society values and consequently pays for on the labour market.
Nothing raises self-respect higher than this feeling; which indeed is
often exaggerated to the ridiculous belief that one is indispensable.
To the healthy man, however, it gives the strength to console himself
for the unalterable fact that he is able to satisfy his wants only by
toil and pain. As people say: he makes the best of a bad job.
Of the three sources of that which we may call the 'joy of labour'
the first, arising from perversion of the true ends of the work, will
undoubtedly exist in the socialist community. As under capitalist
society it will naturally be :restricted to a narrow circle. The other
two sources of the joy of labour will presumably dry up completely.

STI MULUS TO LABOUR
labourer is dissolved, as it must be in socialist society, the individual
will always labour under the impression that proportionately too
much work has been piled on him. The over-heated, neurasthenic
dislike of work will develop which nowadays we can observe in
practically all government offices and public enterprises. In such
concerns where the pay depends upon rigid schedules, everyone
thinks he is overburdened, that just he is being given too much to
do and things which are too unpleasant - that his achievements are
not duly appreciated and rewarded. Out of these feelings grows a
sullen hate of work which stifles even the pleasure in completing it.
The socialist community cannot count on the �oy of labour' .

§4
The stimulus to labour
It is the duty of the citizen of the socialist commonwealth to work
'
for the community according to his powers and his ability: in return
he has a claim against the community for a share in the social
dividend. He who unjustifiably omits to perform his duty will be
recalled to obedience by the usual methods of state coercion. The
economic administration would exercise so great a power over
individual citizens that it is inconceivable that anyone could
permanently withstand it.
It is not sufficient however that citizens should arrive at their
tasks punctually and spend the prescribed number of hours at their
posts. They must really work while they are there.
In the capitalist system the worker receives the value of the pro­
duct of his labour. The static or natural wage-rate tends to such a
level that the worker receives the value of the product of his labour:
i.e. all that is attributable to his work. 1 The worker himself is there­
fore concerned that his productivity should be as great as possible.
This does not apply to work done for piece rates only. The level of
time rates is also dependent upon the marginal productivity of the
particular kind of work concerned. The technical form of wage pay­
ment which is customary does not alter the level of wages in the long
run. The wage rate has always a tendency to return to its static level,
and time rates are no exception.
But even so work done for time wages gives us an opportunity of

THE SOCIALIST COMMUNITY
observing how work is carried on when the worker feels that he is not
working for himself, because thet:e is no connection between his out­
put and his remuneration. Under time wages the more skilful worker
has no inducement to do more than the minimum expected from
every worker. Piece wages are an incentive to the maximum activity,
time wages to the minimum. Under Capitalism the graduation of
time wages for different kinds of work greatly mitigates these social
effects of the system of payment by time. The worker has a motive
in finding a position where the minimum work required is as great as
he can perform, because the wage increases with the rise in the
minimum requirements.
Only when we depart from the principle ofgraduating time wages
according to the work required does the time wage begin to affect
production adversely. This is particularly noticeable in the case of
state and municipal employment. Here, in the last few decades, not
only has the minimum required from the individual workers been
continually reduced, but every incentive to better work - for ex­

ample, different treatment of the various grades and rapid promotion
of industrious and capable workers to better-paid posts - has been
removed. The result of this policy has clearly vindicated the principle
that the worker only puts forth his best efforts when he knows that
he stands to gain by it.
Under Socialism the usual connection between work performed
and its remuneration cannot exist. All attempts to ascertain what the
work of the individual has produced and thereby to determine the
wage rate, must fail because of the impossibility of calculating the
productive contributions of the different factors of production. The
socialist community could probably make distribution dependent
upon certain external aspects of the work performed. But any such
differentiation would be arbitrary. Let us suppose that the minimum
requirement is determined for each branch of production. Let us
suppose this is done on the basis of Robdertus' proposal for a 'normal
working day'. For each industry there is laid down the time which a
worker with average strength and effort can continue to work and
the amount of work which an average worker of average skill and
industry can perform in this time. 1 We will completely ignore the

1 Rodbertus-Jagetzow, Briefe und sozialpolitische Au!sJtze, edited by R. Meyer,
Berlin ( 1 88 1), p. 553 et seq. We shall not enter here into Rodbertus' other proposals
for the normal working day. They are throughout based on the untenable view
Rodbertus has formed about the problem of value.

technical difficulties in the way of deciding, in any particular con­
crete example the question whether this minimum has been achieved
or not. Nevertheless it is obvious that any such general determina­
tion can only be quite arbitrary. The workers of the different
industries would never be made to agree on this point. Everyone
would maintain that he had been overtasked and would strive for a
reduction of the amount set to him. Average quality of the worker,
average skill, average strength, average effort, average industry ­
these are all vague conceptions that cannot be exactly determined.
Now it is evident that the minimum performance calculated for
the worker of average quality, skill, and strength will be achieved
only by a part - say one-half - of the workers. The others will do
less. How can the authorities ascertain whether a performance be­
low the minimum is due to laziness or incapacity? Either the unfpttp....pA rl

certain general criteria must be established. Doubtless, as a result,
the amount of work performed would be continually reduced.
Under Capitalism everybody who takes an active part in business
life is concerned that labour should be paid the whole product. The
employer who dismisses a worker who is worth his wage harms him­
self. The foreman who discharges a good worker and retains a bad
one, adversely affects the business results of the department under
his charge, and thereby indirectly himself. Here we do not need
formal criteria to limit the decisions of those who have to judge the
work performed. Under Socialism such criteria would have to be
established, because otherwise the powers entrusted to persons in
charge could be arbitrarily misused. And so then the worker
would have no further interest in the actual performance of
work. He would only be concerned to do as much as is pre­
scribed by the formal criteria in order to avoid punishment.
What kind of results will be achieved by workers who are not
directly interested in the product of the work, can be learnt from the
experience of a thousand years of slave labour. Officials and em­
ployees of state and municipal undertakings provide new examples.
An attempt may be made to weaken the argumentative force of the
first example by contending that these workers had no interest in the
result of their labour because they did not share in the distribution ;
in the socialist community everyone would realize that he was work­
ing for himself and that would spur him on to the highest activity.

1 75

THE S O C IA L I S T C O M M U N ITY
But this is just the problem. If the worker exerts himself more at the
work then he has so much the more labour disutility to overcome.
But he will receive only an infinitesimal fraction of the result of his
increased effort. The prospect of receiving a two thousand millionth
part of the result of his increased effort will scarcely stimulate him to
exert his powers any more than he needs. 1
Socialist writers generally pass over these ticklish questions in
silence or with a few inconsequential remarks. They only bring
forward a few sententious phrases and nothing else.' The new man
of Socialism will be free from base self-seeking ; he will be morally
infinitely above the man of the frightful age of private property and
from a profound knowledge of the coherency of things and from a
noble perception of duty he will devote all his powers to the general
welfare.
But closer examination shows that these arguments lead to only
two conceivable alternatives : free obedience to the moral law with
no compulsion save that of the individual conscience, or enforced
service under a system of reward and punishment. Neither will
achieve the end. The former supplies no sufficient incentive to per­
sist in overcoming the disutility of labour even though it is publicly
extolled on every possible occasion and proclaimed in all schools and
churches; the latter can only lead to a formal performance of duty,
never to performance with the expenditure of all one's powers.
The writer who has occupied himself most thoroughly with this
problem is John Stuart Mill. All subsequent arguments are derived
from his. His ideas are to be encountered everywhere in the litera­
ture of the subject and in everyday political discussion; they have
even become popular catchwords. Everyone is familiar with them
even if he is totally unacquainted with the author.a They have pro­
vided for decades one of the main props of the socialist idea, and have
contributed more to its popularity than the hate-inspired and
frequently contradictory arguments of socialist agitators.
One of the main objections, says Mill, that could be urged against
the practicability of the socialist idea, is that each person would be

1 76

STIMULUS TO LABOUR

incessantly occupied in evading his fair share of work. But those
who urge this objection forget to how great an extent the same diffi­
culty exists under the system under which nine-tenths of the business
of society is now conducted. The objection supposes that honest and
efficient labour is only to be had from those who are themselves
individually to reap the benefit of their own exertions. But under the
present system only a small fraction of all labour can do this. Time
rates or fixed salaries are the prevailing forms of remuneration. Work
is performed by people who have less personal interest in the execu­
tion of the task than the members of a socialist community, since,
unlike the latter, they are not working for an enterprise in which they
are partners. In the majority of cases they are not personally super­
intended and directed by people whose own interests are bound up
with the results of the enterprise. For employees paid by time carry
out even the supervisory, managing and technicai work. It may be
admitted that labour would be more productive in a system in which
the whole or a large share of the product of extra exertion belongs to
the labourer, but under the present system it is precisely this incentive
which is lacking. Even if communistic labour might be less vigorous
than that of a peasant proprietor, or a workman labouring on his
own account, it would probably be more energetic than that of a
labourer for hire, who has no personal interest in the matter at all .
One can easily see the cause of Mill's mistake. The last repre­
sentative of the classical school of economists, he did not survive to see
the transformation of economics by the subjective theory of value,
and he did not know the connection between wage rates and the
marginal productivity of labour. He does not perceive that the
worker has an interest in doing his utmost because his income de­
pends upon the value of the work which he performs. Without the
light of modern economic thought he sees only on the surface and
not into the heart of things. Doubtless the individual working for a
time wage has no interest in doing more than will keep his job. But
if he can do more, if his knowledge, capability and strength permit,
he seeks for a oost where more is wanted and where he can thus
increase his inc�me. It may be that he fails to do this out of laziness,
but this is not the fault of the system. The system does all that it can
to incite everyone to the utmost diligence, since it ensures to everyone
the fruits of his labour. That Socialism cannot do this is the great
difference between Socialism and Capitalism.
1 77

THE S O C IALIST C OMMUNITY

In the extreme case of obstinate perseverance in not performing
a due share of work, the socialist community, Mill thinks, would have
reserve powers which society now has at its disposal: it could submit
the workers to the rules of a coercive institution. Dismissal, the only
remedy at present, is no remedy when no other labourer who can be
engaged does any better than his predecessor. The power to dismiss
only enables an employer to obtain from his workman the customary
amount of labour; but that customary labour may be of any degree
of inefficiency.
The fallacy of this argument is plain. Mill does not realize that
the wage rate is adjusted according to this customary amount of
labour, and that the workers who wishes to earn more must do more.
It may be admitted straight away that wherever the time wage pre­
vails the individual worker is obliged to seek elsewhere for a job in
which the customary amount of iabour is greater because he has no
chance of increasing his income by doing more work if he remains
where he is. In the circumstances he must change over to piece
work, take up another occupation, or even emigrate. In this way
millions have emigrated from those European countries, where the
customary amount of labour is low, to Western Europe or to the
United States, where they have to work more but earn more. The
inferior workers remain behind, and are content to work less for
less wages.
If this is kept in mind it is also easy to understand the case of
supervisory and managerial work performed by employees. Their
activities, too, are paid according to the value of the service: they, too,
must do as much as they can if they wish to obtain the highest
possible income. They can and must be given authority in the name
of the entrepreneur to take on and dismiss workers without any fear
that they will abuse the power. They perform the social task incum­
bent upon them of securing that the worker obtains only as much
wages as his work is worth, apart from any other consideration what­
ever. 1 The system of economic calculation supplies a sufficient test
of the efficacy of their work. This distintruishes their work from the
kind of cont�ol which could be exercis�d under Socialism. They
harm themselves if from revengeful motives they treat a worker
worse than he deserves. (Naturally 'deserves' is not used here in any

ethical sense.) This authority to dismiss workers and fix their wages
which the employer possesses and deputes to subordinates, is con­
sidered by socialists to be dangerous in the hands of private indi­
viduals. But the socialists overlook the fact that the employer's
ability to exercise this power is limited, that he cannot dismiss and
mistreat arbitrarily because the result would be harmful to himself.
In endeavouring to purchase labour as cheaply as possible the em­
ployer is fulfilling one of his most important social tasks.
Mill admits that in the present state of society the neglect by the
uneducated classes of labourers for hire of the duties which they
engage to perform is flagrant. This, he thinks, can only be attributed
to a low level of education. Under Socialism, with universal educa­
tion, all citizens would undoubtedly fulfil their duty towards society
as zealously as the majority of those members of the upper and
middle classes who are in receipt of salaries, perform it to-day. It is
clear that Mill's thought repeatedly involves the same error. He does
not see that in this case too, there is a correspondence between pay­
ment and performance. Finally he is compelled to admit that, there
can be no doubt that remuneration by fixed salaries does not produce
the maximum of zeal in any class of functionaries. To this extent,
Mill says, objection could reasonably be made against the socialist
organization oflabour. Itis, however, according to Mill, by no means
certain that this inferiority will continue in a socialist community
as is assumed by those whose imaginations are little used to range
beyond the state of things with which they are familiar. It is not
impossible that under Socialism the public spirit will be so general
that disinterested devotion to the common welfare will take the
place of self seeking. Here Mill lapses into the dreams ofthe Utopians
and conceives it possible that public opinion will be powerful enough
to incite the individual to increased zeal for labour, that ambition
and self-conceit will be effective motives, and so on.
It need only be said that unfortunately we have no reason to
assume that human nature will be any different under Socialism from
what it is now. And nothing goes to prove that rewards in the shape
of distinctions, material gifts, or even the honourable recognition of

fellow citizens, will induce the workers to do more than the formal
execution of the tasks allotted to them. Nothing can completely
replace the motive to overcome the irksomeness of labour which is
given by the opportunity to obtain the full value of that labour.

1 79

THE SO CIALIST COMMUNITY
Many socialists of course think that this argument can be refuted
by appeal to the labour which in the past has been performed without
the incentive of a wage payment. They instance the case of the labours
of scientists and artists, of the doctor who exhausts himself at the sick­
bed, the soldier who dies the death of a hero , the statesman who
sacrifices all for his idea. But the artist and the scientist find their
satisfaction in the work itself, and in the recognition which they hope
to gain at some time, if only from posterity, even though material
gains are not forthcoming. The doctor and the professional soldier
are in the same position as many other workers whose work is
associated with danger. The supply of workers for these professions
reflects their lesser attractiveness, and the wage is adapted corre­
spondingly. But if, in spite of the danger, a man enters the profession
for sake of the higher remuneration and other advantages and
honours, he cannot evade the dangers without the greatest prejudice
to himself. The professional soldier who turned tail, the doctor who
refused to treat an infectious case, would endanger their future
careers to such an extent that they have virtually no choice in the
matter. It cannot be denied that there are doctors who are con­
cerned to do their utmost in cases where no one would detect remiss­
ness, and that there are professional soldiers who incur danger when
no one would reproach them for avoiding it. But in these exceptional
cases, as in the case of the staunch statesman who is ready to die for
his principles, man raises himself, as is given to few to do, to the
highest peak of manhood, to complete union of will and deed. In
his exclusive devotion to a single purpose which sets aside all other
desires, thoughts and feelings, removes the instinct of self-preserva- '
tion and makes him indifferent to pain and suffering, such a man
forgets the world, and nothing remains except the one thing to which
he sacrifices himself and his life. Of such men it used to be said,
according to the estimate set on their aims, that the spirit of the
Lord moved them, or that they were possessed of the devil - so
incomprehensible were their motives to the ordinary run of mankind.
It is certain that mankind would not have risen above the beasts
if it had not had such leaders; but it is certain that mankind does not
in the main consist of such men. The essential social problem is to
make useful members of society out of the general masses.
Socialist writers have for a long time ceased to exercise their
ingenuity on this insoluble problem.

PRO D U C T I V ITY O F L AB O U R

more than that habit and discipline will provide incentives to work
in the future. 'Capital has so accustomed the modern labourer to
work day in and day out that he cannot endure to be without his
work. There are even people who are so accustomed to work that
they do not know what to do with their leisure time and are unhappy
when they cannot work.' Kautsky does not seem to fear that this
habit could be shaken off more easily than other habits such as
eating and sleeping but he is not prepared to rely on this incentive
alone, and freely admits that 'it is the weakest'. He therefore recom­
mends discipline. Naturally not 'military discipline' nor 'blind
obedience to an authority imposed from above', but 'democratic
discipline - the free subjection to elected leadership'. But then
doubts arise and he endeav.)urs to dispel them with the idea that
under Socialism labour will be so attractive 'that it will be a pleasure
to work', but finally admits that this will not be sufficient at first,
and at last arrives at the conclusion that besides the attractiveness of
the work some other incentive must be brought to bear, 'that of the
wages of labour' 1
Thus even Kautsky, after many limitations and considerations,
arrives at this result, that the irksomeness of labour will only be
overcome if the product of labour, and only the product of his own
labour, accrues to the worker, in so far as he is not also an owner
or an employer. But this is to deny the feasibility of socialistic
organization of labour, since private property in the means of pro­
duction cannot be abolished without abolishing at the same time
the possibility of remunerating the labourer according to the product
of his labour.
.

§s
The productivity of labour
The old 'distributivist' theories were based on the assumption that
it only needed equal distribution for everyone to have if not riches,
at least a comfortable existence. This seemed so obvious, that hardly
any trouble was taken to prove it. At the beginning Socialism took
over this assumption in its entirety, and expected that comfort for
all would be achieved by an equal distribution of the social income.

1 Kautsky, Die so::iale Revolution, n, p.
J8J

IS et seq.

T H E S O C IAL IST C O M MU N I T Y
Only when the criticisms of their opponents drew their attention to
the fact that equal distribution of the income obtained by the whole
economic society would scarcely improve the conditions of the masses
at all, did they set up the proposition that capitalist methods of pro­
duction restrict the productivity of labour, and that Socialism would
remove these limitations and multiply production to ensure for
everyone a life in comfortable circumstances. Without troubling
about the fact that they had not succeeded in disproving the assertion
of the liberal school that productivity under Socialism would sink
so low that want and poverty would be general, socialist writers
began to promulgate fantastic assertions about the increase in pro­

ductivity to be expected under Socialism.
Kautsky mentions two ways of achieving increased production
by a transition from capitalistic to socialistic methods of production.
One is the concentration of all production in the best concerns and
the closing down of the less efficient. 1 That this is a means of
increasing production cannot be denied, but it is a means which
operates most effectively under the regime of an exchange-economy.
Competition ruthlessly eliminates all inferior productive under­
takings and concerns. That it does so is a constant source of com­
plaint from those involved, and because of it the weaker undertakings
demand State subsidies, special consideration in public contracts,
and in general restriction of freedom of competition in every possible
way. Kautsky is forced to admit that trusts formed by private enter­
prise exploit these means to the utmost, so as to obtain higher pro­
ductivity, and in fact he frankly regards them as the forerunners of
the social revolution. It is more than questionable whether the
socialist State would feel the same necessity to carry out similar
improvements in production. Would it not continue an unprofitable
undertaking rather than provoke local prejudice by its discontinu­
ance? The private entrepreneur closes down without much ado
undertakings that no longer pay; and in this way he compels the
worker to change his locality and sometimes even his occupation.
Undoubtedly this involves initial hardships for the people concerned,
but it is to the general advantage, since it makes possible a cheaper
and better provisioning of the market. Would the- Socialist State do
likewise? Would it not, on the contrary, be constrained for political
reasons to avoid local discontent? On most state railways all reforms

1 82

PRODUCTIVITY OF LABOUR
of this kind are frustrated by the attempt to avoid the harm to par­
ticular districts which would result from the elimination of super­
fluous branch offices, workshops, and power stations. Even the
army administration has encountered parliamentary opposition
when for military reasons it has been desired to withdraw a garrison
from a particular place.
His second method of achieving increased production, viz. ,
'economies of every description', o n his own admission, Kautsky
already finds operating under the trust of to-day. He particularly
mentions economies of materials, transport charges, advertisements
and publicity costs. 1 As far as economies in materials and transport

are concerned, experience shows that nothing is operated with less

economy and with more waste of labour and material of every kind
than public services and undertakings. Private enterprise on the
other hand naturally induces the owner to work with the greatest
economy in his own interest.
Of course the Socialist state would save all advertising expenses,
all the costs of commercial travellers and agents. But it is more than
probable that it would employ many more persons in the service of
the apparatus of distribution. Wartime experience has taught us
how cumbrous and expensive the social apparatus of distribution
can be. Were the costs of bread, flour, meat, sugar, and other cards
really less than the costs of advertisement? Has the enormous per­
sonnel required to run a rationing system been cheaper than the
expenditure on commercial travellers and agents?
Socialism would eliminate the small retailers. But in their place
it must set up distributive centres which would not be cheaper.
Co-operative stores do not employ less hands than the retail stores
organized on modern lines, and many of them, because of their
large expenses, could not compete with the latter if they were not
granted privileges of exemption from taxation.
Speaking generally, it must be said that it is inadmissible to pick
out special costs in capitalist society, and then at once to infer from
the fact that they would disappear in a socialist society, that the
productivity of the latter would surpass that of the former. It is
necessary to compare the total costs and the total yieids of both systems.
The fact that the electromobile needs no petrol is no proof that it is
cheaper to run than the petrol-driven car.

T H E S O C I ALIST COMMUN I TY
The weakness of Kautsky's argument is evident, when he asserts
that 'by the application of these two methods a proletarian regime
could raise production to such a high level that it would be possible
to increase wages considerably and at the same time reduce the hours
of labour' . Here he is making an assertion for which he offers no
proof whatever. 1
And it is no better with the other arguments that are often brought
forward to prove the supposed higher productivity of a socialistic
society. When for example people argue that under Socialism
everyone capable of work will have to work, they are sadly mistaken
as to the number of idlers under Capitalism.
So far as can be judged there is no convincing reason for sup­
posing that labour under Socialism would be more productive than
under Capitalism. On the contrary it can be asserted that under a
system which provides no incentive to the worker to overcome the
irksomeness of iabour and to strive his utmost, the productivity of
labour must inevitably decline. But the problem of productivity
cannot be dealt with only within the limits of a study of static con­
ditions. Incomparably more important than the question whether
the transition to Socialism would increase productivity is the question
whether, given the existence of a socialistic order, it would be able
further to increase production and to achieve economic progress.
This leads us to the problem of dynamics.
•

1 In the years of controlled economy we heard quite often of frozen potatoes, rotten
fruit, spoiled vegetables. Did such things not happen formerly? Certainly. But they
happened less often. The merchant whose fruit spoiled suffered monetary loss, and
that made him careful in the future. If he did not take better care he was ruined at
last. He ceased to direct production and was removed to a place in economic life
where he could do no more harm. But it is otherwise with the goods which the state
deals in. Here there is no individual interest behind the commodities. Here officials
trade, whose responsibility is so divided that no one gets particularly excited about a
small misfoltune.

CHAPTER

V

TH E POSITION OF TH E
INDIVIDUAL UNDER SOCIALISM

§I
Selectio11 ofpersonnel and choice of occupation

HE Socialist Community is a great authoritarian association in
T which orders are issued and obeyed. This is what is implied

by the words 'planned economy' and the 'abolition of the anarchy
of production'. The inner structure of a socialist community is best
understood if ,·,e compare it \\tith t..�e inner structure of an army.
Many socialists indeed prefer to speak of the 'army of labour' As
in an army, so under Socialism, everything depends on the orders
of the supreme authority. Everyone has a place to which he is ap­
pointed. Everyone has to remain in his place until he is moved to
another. It follows that men become the mere pawns of official
action. They rise only when they are promoted. They sink only
when they are degraded. It would be waste of time to describe such
conditions. They are the common knowledge of every citizen of a
bureaucratic state.
It is obvious that, in a state of this sort, all appointments should
be based upon personal capacity. Each position should be held by
the individual best fitted to hold it - always provided that he is not
required for more important work elsewhere. Such is the funda­
mental principle of all systematically ordered authoritarian organiza­
tions - of the Chinese Mandarinate equally with modern bureau­
cracies.
In giving effect to this principle the first problem that arises is the
appointment of the supreme authority. There are two ways to the
solution of this problem, the oligarchical-monarchical and the demo­
cratic, but there can be only one solution - the charismatic solution.
The supreme rulers (or ruler) are chosen in virtue of the grace with
which they are endowed by divine dispensation. They have super­
human powers and capacities lifting them above the other mortals.
To resist them is not only to resist the powers that be; it is to defY
185
.

THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER SOCIALISM
the commandments of the Deity. Such is the basis of theocracies
of clerical aristocracies or realms of 'the Lord's anointed' . But it is
equally the basis of the Bolshevist dictatorship in Russia. Summoned

-

by history to the performance of their sublime task, the Bolsheviks
pose as the representatives of humanity, as the tools of necessity, as
the consummators of the great scheme of things. Resistance to them
is the greatest of all crimes. But against their adversaries they may
resort to any expedients. It is the old aristocratic-theocratic idea in
a new form.
Democracy is the other method of solving the problem. Demo­
cracy places everything in the hands of the majority. At its head is
a ruler, or rulers, chosen by a majority decision. But the basis of this
is as charismatic as any other. Only in this case grace is regarded as
being granted in equal proportions to all and sundry. Everyone is
endowed with it. The voice of the people is the voice of God. This
is to be seen especially clearly in Tommaso CampaneUa's City of the
Sun. The Regent chosen by the national assembly is also priest and
his name is 'Hoh', that means : metaphysics. 1 In authoritarian
ideology, democracy is valued not for its social functions, but only
as a means for the ascertainment of the absolute. I
According to charismatic theory, in appointing officials the

supreme authority transmits to them the grace it possesses itself. An
official appointment raises ordinary mortals above the level of the
masses. They count for more than others. When on duty their
status is especially enhanced. No doubt of their capacity, or of their
fitness for office, is permissible. Office makes the man.
Apart from their polemical value, all these theories are purely
formal. They do not tell us anything about how such appointments
actually work. They are indifferent to origins. They do not inquire
whether the dynasties and the aristocracies concerned attained to
power by the chance of war. They give no idea of the mechanism
of the party system which brings the leaders of a democracy to the
helm. They tell nothing of the actual machinery for selecting officials.
But since only an omniscient ruler could do without them, special
arrangements for the appointment of the officials must be made.
Since the supreme authority cannot do everything, appointment to

ART AND L I TERATURE
lesser positions at least must be left to subordinate authorities. To
prevent this power from degenerating into mere licence, it must be
hedged about by regulations. In this way selection comes to be
based not on genuine capacity but on compliance with certain forms,
the passing of certain examinations, attendance at certain schools,
having spent a certain number of years in a subordinate position,
and so on. Of the shortcomings of such methods there can be only
one opinion. The successful conduct of business demands qualities
quite other than those necessary for passing examinations -- even if
the examinations deal with subjects bearing on the work of the posi­
tion in question. A man who has spent a certain time in a subordi­
nate capacity is far from being, for that reason, fitted for a higher
post. It is not true that one learns to command by first learning to
obey. Age is no substitute for personal capacity. In short, the system
is deficient. Its only justification is that nothing better is known to
put in its place.
Attempts have recently been made to invoke the aid of experi­
mental psychology and physiology, and many promise therefrom
results of the highest importance to Socialism.

There can be no

doubt that under Socialism, something corresponding to medical
examination for military service would have to be employed on a
larger scale and with more refined methods. Those who feigned
bodily deformities to escape difficult and uncongenial work would
have to be examined, as would those who attempted work for which
they were not properly developed. But the warmest advocates of
such methods could scarcely pretend that they could do more than
impose a very loose curb upon the grossest abuses of officialdom.
For all those kinds of work demanding something more than mere
muscular strength and a good development of particular senses they
are not applicable at all.

Art and Literature, Science and Joumalism
Socialist society is a society of officials. The way of living pre­
vailing in it, and the mode of thinking of its members, are determined
by this fact. People who are always expecting promotion, people
who had always a 'chief' on whom they depend, people who, because

THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER SOCIALISM

they receive a fixed salary, never understand the connection between
production and their own consumption - the last ten years has wit­
nessed the rise of this type everywhere in Europe. It is in Germany,
however, where it is especially at home. The whole psychology of
our time derives from it.
Socialism knows no freedom of choice in occupation. Everyone
has to do what he is told to do and to go where he is sent. Anything
else is unthinkable. We shall discuss later and in another connection
how this will affect the productivity of labour. Here we have to
discuss the position of art and science, literature and the press under
such conditions.
Under Bolshevism in Russia and Hungary, the artists, scientists
and writers, who were recognized as such by the selectors appointed
for this purpose, were exempted from the general obligation to work
and given a definite saiary. Aii such as were not recognized remained
subject to the general obligation to work and received no support
for other activity. The press was nationalized.
This is the simplest solution of the problem, and one which
harmonizes completely with the general structure of socialist society.
Officialdom is extended to the sphere of the spirit. Those who do not
please the holders of power are not allowed to paint or to sculpt or
to conduct an orchestra. Their works are not printed or performed.
And if the decision does not depend directly upon the free judgment
of the economic administration but is referred to the advice of an
expert council the case is not materially altered. On the contrary,
expert councils, which are inevitably composed of the old and the
established, must be admitted to be even less competent than laymen
to assist the rise of young talent with different views and perhaps
greater mastery than their own. Even if the choice were referred to
the whole nation the rise of independent spirits setting themselves
against traditional technique and accepted opinions would not be
facilitated. Such methods can only foster a race of epigoni.
In Cabet's Icaria, only such books which please the republic are
to be printed (Ies ouvrages briflres) . Writings of pre-socialistic times
are to be examined by the Republic. Those which are partially
useful are to be revised. Those which are regarded as dangerous or
useless are to be burnt. The objection, that this would be to do what
Omar did by burning the Alexandrian Library, Cabet held to be
quite untenable. For, said he, 'nous faisons en faveur de l'humanite

F.rom a point of view such as this, solution of the problem of tolera­
tion is impossible. Mere opportunists excepted, everyone is con­
vinced of the rightness of his opinions. But, if such a conviction by
itself were a justification for intolerance, then everyone would have a
right to coerce and persecute everyone else of another way of think­
ing. a In these circumstances, the demand for toleration can only be
a prerogative of the weak. With power comes the exercise of
intolerance. In such a case there must always be war and enmity
between men. Peaceful co-operation is out of the question. It is
because it desires peace that Liberalism demands toleration for
all opinions.
Under Capitalism the artist and the scientist have many alterna­
tives open to them. If they are rich they can follow their own
inclinations. They can seek out rich patrons. They can work as
public officials. They can attempt to live on the sale of their creative
work. Each of these alternatives has its dangers, in particular the
two latter. I t may well be that he who gives new values to mankind,
or who is capable of so giving, suffers want and poverty. But there
is no way to prevent this effectively. The creative spirit innovates
necessarily. It must press forward. It must destroy the old and set
the new in its place. It could not conceivably be relieved of this
burden. lfit were it would cease to be a pioneer. Progress cannot be
organized.' It is not difficult to ensure that the genius who has com­
pleted his work shall be crowned with laurel ; that his mortal remains
shall be laid in a grave of honour and monuments erected to his

memory. But it is impossible to smooth the way that he must tread

if he is to fulfil his destiny. Society can do nothing to aid progress.

If it does not load the individual with quite unbreakable chains, if it
does not surround the prison in which it encloses him with quite Ulil­
surmountable walls, it has done all that can be expected ofit. Genius
will soon find a way to win its own freedom.
The nationalization of intellectual life, which must be attempted
under Socialism, must make all intellectual progress impossible. It
is possible to deceive oneself about this because, in Russia, new kinds
of art have become the fashion. But the authors of these innovations
were already working, when the Soviet came into power. They sided
with it because, not having been recognized hitherto, they enter­
tained hopes of recognition from the new regime. The great ques­
tion, however, is whether later innovators will be able to oust them
from the position they have now gained.
In Bebel's Utopia only physical labour is recognized by society.
Art and science are relegated to leisure hours. In this way, thinks
Bebel, the society of the future 'will possess scientists and artists of all
kinds in countless numbers'. These, according to their several in­
clinations, will pursue their studies and their arts in their spare time. 1
Thus Bebel allows himself to be swayed by the manual labourer's
philistine resentment against all those who are not hewers of wood
and drawers of water. All mental work he regards as mere dilettant­
ism, as can be seen from the fact that he groups it with 'social inter­
course'. a But nevertheless we must inquire whether under these
conditions the mind would be able to create that freedom without
which it cannot exist.
Obviously all artistic and scientific work which demands time,
travel, technical education and great material expenditl�re, would
be quite out of the question. But we will assume that it is possible
to devote oneself to writing or to music, after the day's work is done.
We will assume further that such activities will not be hindered by

How Bebel pictured to himself life in a socialist community is shown by the
following: 'Here she (Woman) is active under the same conditions as the man. At one
moment a practical worker in some industry she is in the next hour educator, teacher,
nurse; in the third part of the day she exercises some art or cultivates a science; and
in the fourth part she fulfils some administrative function. She enjoys studies, pleasures
and amusement with her like or with men, just as she wishes and as the opportunity
offers. In love choice she is free and unfettered like the man. She woos or lets herself
be wooed, etc.' (Bebe1, op. cit., p. 243).

malicious intervention on the part of the economic administration by transferring unpopular authors to remote localities, for instance so that with the aid perhaps of devoted friends, an author or a com­
poser is able to save enough to pay the fee demanded by the state
printing works for the publication of a small edition. In this way he
may even succeed in bringing out a little independent periodical ­
perhaps even in procuring a theatrical production. 1 But all this
would have to overcome the overwhelming competition of the
officially supported arts, and the economic administration could at
any time suppress it. For we must not forget that as one could not
ascertain the cost of printing, the economic administration would be
free to decide the business conditions under which publication
could take place. No censor, no emperor, no pope, has ever possessed
the power to suppress intellectual freedom which would be possessed
by a socialist community.

§3
Personal liberry
It is customary to describe the position of the individual under
Socialism by saying that he would be unfree, that the socialist com�
munity would be a 'prison state'. This expression contains a judg�
ment of value which, as such, lies outside the sphere of scientific
thought. Science cannot decide whether freedom is a good or an
evil or a mere matter of indifference. It can only inquire wherein
freedom consists and where freedom resides.
Freedom is a sociological concept. It is meaningless to apply it
to conditions outside society: as can be well seen from the confusions
prevailing everywhere in the celebrated free-will controversy. The
life of man depends upon natural conditions that he has no power to
alter. He lives and dies under these conditions and, because they
are not subject to his will, he must subordinate himself to them.
Everything he does is subiect to them. If he throws a stone it follows
a co�rse c� nditioned by i'tature. If he eats and drinks the processes
within his body are similarly determined. We attempt to exhibit this
dependence of the process of events upon definite and permanent

functional relationship� by the idea of the conformity of all natural
occurrences to unerring and unchangeable laws. These laws
dominate man' s life; he is completely circumscribed by them. His
will and his actions are only conceivable as taking pl?ce within their
limits. Against nature and within nature there is no freedom.
Social life� too, is a part of nature and, within it� unalterable laws
of nature hold their sway. Action� and the results of action� are con­
ditioned by these laws. If, with the origin of action in will, and its
working out in societies� we associate an idea of freedom� this is not
because we conceive that such action takes place independently of
natural laws : the meaning ofthis concept offreedom is quite different.
It is not here a question of the problem of internal freedom. It is
the problem of external freedom with which we are concerned. The
former is a problem of the origin of willing, the latter of the working
out of action. Everv man is dependent upon the attitude of his fellow
·
men. He is affected by their �ctions in a multitude of ways. If he
has to suffer them to treat him as if he had no will of his own, if he
cannot prevent them from riding rough-shod over his wishes� he
must feel a one-sided dependence upon them and will say that he is
unfree. If he is weaker� he must accommodate himself to coercion
by them.
Under the social relations that arise from co-operation in common
work this one-sided dependence becomes reciprocal. In so far as
each individual acts as a member of society he is obliged to adapt
himself to the will of his fellows. In this way no one depends more
upon others than others depend upon him. This is what we understand
by external freedom. It is a disposition ofindividuals within the frame­
work of social necessity involving� on the one side� limitation of the
freedom of the individual in relation to others� and� on the other,
limitation of the freedom of others in relation to him.
An example should make this clear. Under Capitalism the
employer appears to have grea t power over the employee. Whether
he engages a man, how he employs him, what wages he gives him�
whether he dismisses him - all depend upon his decision. But this
freedom on his part and the corresponding unfreedom of the other
are only apparent. The conduct of the employer to the employee is
part of a social process. If he does not deal with the employee in a
�
manner appropriate to the social valuation of the employee s service�
then there arise consequences which he himself has to bear. He can�
1 92

PER SONAL LIBERTY
indeed, deal badly with the employee, but he himself must pay the
costs of his arbitrary behaviour. To this extent therefore the
employee is dependent upon him. But this dependence is not greater
that the dependence of each one of us upon our neighbopr. For even
in a state where the laws are enforced everybody of course who is
willing to bear the consequences of his action, is free to break our
windows or do us bodily harm.
Strictly speaking, of course, on this view there can be no social
action which is entirely arbitrary. Even the oriental despot, who to
all appearances is free to do what he likes with the life of the enemy
he captures, must consider the results of his action. But there are
differences of degree in the way in which the costs of arbitrary action
are related to the satisfactions arising therefrom. No laws can afford
us protection against the assaults of men whose enmity is such that
they are willing to bear all the consequences of their action. But if
the laws are sufficiently severe to ensure that, as a general rule, our
peace is not disturbed, then we feel ourselves independent of the
evil intentions of our fellows, at any rate to a certain extent. The
historical relaxation of the penal laws is to be attributed, not to an
amelioration of morals, or to decadence on the part of legislators,
but simply to the fact that so far as men have learnt to check resent­
ment by considering the consequences of action it has been possible
to abate the severity of punishments without weakening their
deterrent power. To-day the menace of a short term of imprison­
ment is more effective protection against crimes against the person
than the gallows were at one time.
There is no place for the arbitrary, where exact money reckoning
enables us completely to calculate action. If we allow ourselves to
be carried away by the current laments over the stony-heartedness
of an age which reckons everything in terms of shillings and pence,
we overlook that it is precisely this linking up of action with con­

siderations of money profit which is society's most effective means
of limiting arbitrary action. It is precisely arrangements of this
kind which makes the consumer on the one hand, the employer, the
capitalist, the landowner and the worker on the other - in short,
all concerned in producing for demands other than their own ­
dependent upon social co-operation. Only complete failure to
understand this reciprocity of relationship can lead anyone to ask
whether the debtor is dependent on the creditor, or the creditor on
1 93

THE

INDIVIDUAL UNDER

SOCIAL ISM

the debtor. In fact, each is dependent on the other, and the relation­
ship between buyer and seller, employer and employee, is of the

same nature. It is customary to complain that, nowadays, personal
considerations are banished from business life and that money rules
everything. But what really is here complained of is simply that, in
that department of activity which we call purely economic, whims
and favours are banished and only those considerations are valid
which social co-operation demands.
This, then, is freedom in the external life of man - that he is
independent of the arbitrary power of his fellows. Such freedom is no
natural right. It did not exist under primitive conditions. It arose in
the process of social development and its final completion is the work
of mature Capitalism. The man of pre-capitalistic days was subject
to a 'gracious lord' whose favour he had to acquire. Capitalism
recognizes no such relation, It no longer divide.s society into despotic
rulers and rightless serfs. All relations are material and impersonal,
calculable and capable of substitution. With capitalistic money
calculations freedom descends from the sphere of dreams to reality.
When men have gained freedom in purely economic relationships

they begin to desire it elsewhere. Hand in hand with the develop­
ment of Capitalism, therefore, go attempts to expel from the State
all arbitrariness and all personal dependence. To obtain legal
recognition of the subj ective rights of citizens, to limit the arbitrary
action of officials to the narrowest possible field - this is the aim and
object of the liberal movement. It demands not grace but rights.
And it recognizes from the outset that there is no other way of
realizing this demand than by the most rigid suppressing of the
powers of the State over the individual. Freedom, in its view, is
freedom from the State.
For the State - the coercive apparatus worked by the persons
forming the government - is scathless to freedom only when
its actions have to conform to certain clear, unequivocal, universal
norms, or when they obey the principles governing all work for
profit. The former is the case when it functions judicially; for the
judge is bound by iaws aHowing smaH piay for personal opinion. The
latter is the case when under Capitalism the State functions as an
entrepreneur working under the same conditions and subject to the
same principles as other entrepreneurs working for a profit. What it
does beyond this can neither be determined by law or in any other
1 94

PERSO NAL LIBERTY
way limited sufficie.tly to guard against arbitrary action. The
individual then has no defence against the decision of officials. He
cannot calculate what consequences his actions will have because he
cannot tell how they will be regarded by those on whom he depends.
This is the negation of freedom.
It is customary to regard the problem of external freedom as a
problem of the greater or less dependence of the individual upon
society. l But political freedom is not the whole of freedom. In order
that a man may be free it is not sufficient that he may do anything
unharmful to others without hindrance from the government or
from the repressive power of custom. He must also be in the position
to act without fearing unforeseen social consequences. Only
Capitalism guarantees this freedom by explicitly referring all
reciprocal relations to the cold impersonal principle of exchange

do ut des.

Socialists usually attempt to refute the argument for freedom by
contending that under Capitalism only the possessor is free. The
proletarian is unfree because he must work for his livelihood. It is
impossible to imagine a cruder conception of freedom. That man
must work, because his desire to consume is greater than that of the
beasts of the field, is part of the nature of things. That the possessor
is able to live without conforming to this rule is a gain derived from
the existence ofsociety which injures no one - not even the possession­
less. And the possessionless themselves benefit from the existence of
society, in that co-operation makes labour more productive.
Socialism could only lessen the dependence of the individual upon
natural conditions by increasing this productivity. If it cannot do
that, if on the contrary it diminishes productivity, then it will
diminish freedom.

CONDI T IONS

§I
The nature of the dynamic forces
HE idea of a stationary state is an aid to theoretical speculation.

T In the world ofreality there is no stationary state, for the conditions

under which economic activity takes place are subject to perpetual
alterations which it is beyond human capacity to limit.
The influences which maintain this perpetual change in the
economic system can be grouped into six great classes. First and
foremost come changes in external Nature. Under this heading must
be classified not only all those changes in climate and other specifically

natural conditions which take place independent of human actions,
but also changes arising from operations carried out within these
conditions, such as exhaustion of the soil, or consumption of standing
timber, or mineral deposits. Secondly come changes in the quantity
and quality of the popUlation, then changes in the quantity and
quality of capital goods, then changes in the technique of production,
then changes in the organization of labour, and finally changes in
demand. 1
Of all these causes of change the first is the most fundamentally
important. For the sake of argument let us assume that a socialist
community might be able so to regulate the growth of population and
demand for commodities as to avert danger to the economic equi­
librium from these factors. Were that so there are other causes of
change that could be avoided. But the socialist community would
never be able to influence the natural conditions of economic
activity. Nature does not adapt itself to man. Man must adapt
himseif to Nature. Even the sociaiist community win have to reckon
with changes in external nature; it will have to take account of the
consequences of elemental disturbances. It will have to take account
of the fact that the natural powers and resources at its disposal are

1 96

CHANGES IN POPULATION
not inexhaustible. Disturbances from without will intrude on its
peaceful running. No more than Capitalism will it be able to remain
stationary.

§2
Changes in population
For the naive socialist there i� quite enough in the world to make
everybody happy and contented. The dearth of goods is only the
result of a perverse social order which, on the one hand limits the
extension of productive powers, and on the other, by unequal
distribution, lets too much go to the rich and thus too little to the
poor. l
The Malthusian Law of Population and the Law of Diminishing
Returns put an end to these illusions. Ceteris Paribus the increase of
population beyond a certain point is not accompanied by a pro­
portional increase of wealth : if this point is passed, production per
head diminishes. The question whether at any given time production
has reached this point is a question offact which must not be confused
with the question of general principle.
In the light of this knowledge, socialists have adopted various
attitudes.

Some have simply rejected it.

During the whole of the

nineteenth century scarcely any author was so vigorously attacked as
Malthus. The writings of Marx, Engels, Diihring, and many others,
bristle with abuse of 'parson' Malthus.1 But they do not refute him.
To-day, discussion of the Laws of Population may be regarded as
closed. The Law of Diminishing Returns is not contested nowadays ;
it is therefore not necessary to deal with those authors who either
deny the doctrine or ignore it.
Other socialists imagine that it is possible to undermine such
considerations by pointing to the unprecedented increase in pro­
ductivity which will take place once the means of production are
socialized. It is not necessary at this point to discuss whether in fact
such an increase would take place; for even granted that it would,
this would not alter the fact that at any given time there is a definite
optimal size of population beyond which any increase in numbers

known verse of Heine.

1 97

S O C I A L I S M UNDER DYNA M I C COND I T I ONS
must diminish production per head. If it is desired to deny the
effectiveness of the Laws of Population and Diminishing Returns
under Socialism� then it must be proved that every child born into
the world beyond the existing optimum will at the same time bring
with it so great an increase of productivity that production per head
will not be diminished by its coming.
A third group of writers content themselves with the reflection
that with the spread of civilization and rational living� with the
increase of wealth and the desire for a higher standard of Iife� the
growth of population is slackening. But this is to overlook the fact
that the birth-rate does not fall because the standard of life is higher
but only because of 'moral restraint', and that the incentive to the
individual to refrain from procreation disappears the moment it is
possible to have a family without economic sacrifice because the
children are maintained by society. This is fundamentally the same
error that entrapped Godwin when he thought that there was 'a
principle in human society' which kept the population permanently
within the limits set by the means of subsistence. Malthus exhibited
the nature of this mysterious 'principle' . 1
Without coercive regulation of the growth of population� a
socialist community is inconceivable. A socialist community must
be in a position to prevent the size of the popUlation from mounting
above or falling below certain definite limits. It must attempt to
maintain the population always at that optimal number which
allows the maximum production per head. Equally with any oj:her
order of society it must regard both under- and over-population as
an evil. And since in it those motives� which in a society based on
private ownership of the means of production harmonize the
number of births with the limitations of the means of subsistence�
would not exist, it will be obliged to regulate the matter itself. How
it will accomplish this need not be here discussed. Nor is it relevant
to our purpose to inquire whether its measures will serve eugenic or
ethnological ideas. But it is certain that even if a socialist community
may bring 'free love' � it can in no way bring free birth. The right to
existence of every person born can be said to exist oniy when
undesirable births can be prevented. In the socialist community as
in any other, there will be those for whom 'at the great banquet of

1«/.

CHAN G E S IN DE MAND
Nature no place has been laid' and to whom the order must be given
to withdraw themselves as soon as may be. No indignation that these
words of Malthus may arouse can alter this fact.

§3
Changes in demand
It follows from the principles which the socialist community must
necessarily observe in the distribution of consumption goods, that
alterations of demand cannot be allowed free play. If economic
calculation and therewith even an approximate ascertainment of the
costs of production were possible, then within the limits of the total
consumption-units assigned to him, each individual citizen could be
allowed to demand what he liked, each would choose what was
agreeable to him. It would indeed be possible that as a result of
malicious intent on the part of the directors of production certain
commodities might be priced higher than they need b�. Either they
might be made to bear too high a proportion of overhead costs, or
they might be made dearer by uneconomic methods of production,
and the citizens who suffered would have no defence, except political
agitation, against the government. So long as they remained in a
minority they themselves would not be able either to rectify the
accounts or to improve the methods of production. But at any rate
the fact that at least the greater number of the factors concerned

could be measured and that, as a result of this, the whole question
could be relatively clearly put, would be some support for their point
of view.
Since, under Socialism, no such calculations are possible, all such
questions of demand must necessarily be left to the government. The
citizens as a whole will have the same influence on them as on other
acts of government. The individual will exercise this influence only
in so far as he contributes to the general will. The minority will have
to bow to the will of the majority. The system of proportional
representation, which by its very nature is suitable only for elections
and can never be used for decisions with regard to particular acts,
will not protect them.
The general will, i.e. the will of those who happen to be in
power, will take over those functions which in a free economic system
1 99

S O C IA L I S M U N D E R DYNA M I C C ON D I T I ON S
are discharged by demand. Not individuals but the government
would decide which needs are the most urgent and must therefore
be satisfied first.
For this reason demand will be much more uniform, much less
changeable than under Capitalism. The forces which under
Capitalism are continually bringing about alterations in demand
will be lacking under Socialism. How will innovations, .ideas
deviating from those traditionally accepted, obtain recognition? How
will innovators succeed in getting inert masses out of the rut? Will
the majority be willing to forsake the well beloved customs of their
forefathers for something better, which is yet unknown to them?
Under Capitalism where each individual within the limits of his
means can decide what he is to consume, it is sufficient for one
individual, or a few, to be brought to recognize that the new methods
satisfy their needs better than the old. Others will gradually follow
their exampie and this progressive adoption of new modes of satis­
faction is especially facilitated by the fact that incomes are not
equal. The rich adopt novelties and become accustomed to their use.
This sets a fashion which others imitate. Once the richer classes have
adopted a certain way of living, producers have an incentive to
improve the methods of manufacture so that soon it is possible for the
poorer classes to follow suit. Thus luxury furthers progress. Innova­
tion is the whim of an elite before it becomes a need of the public.
The luxury of to-day is the necessity of to-morrow'. 1 Luxury is the
roadmaker of progress : it develops latent needs and makes people
discontented. In so far as they think consistently, moralists who
condemn luxury must recommend the comparatively desireless
existence of the wild life roaming in the woods as the ultimate ideal of
civilized life.

§4
Changes in the amount of capital
The capital goods employed in production are sooner or later
used up. This is true, not only of those goods which constitute
circulating capital, but also of those which constitute fixed capital.

CHANGES I N THE A MOUNT OF CAPITAL
Those, too, sooner or later are consumed in production. In order that
capital may be maintained in the same proportions, or that it may
be increased, constant effort is necessary on the part of those
who supervise production. Care must be taken that the capital
goods used up in the process of production are replaced; and,
beyond that, that new capital is created. Capital does not reproduce
itself.
In a completely stationary economic system, this operation
demands no particular foresight.
Where everything remains
unchanged, it is not very difficult to ascertain what becomes used up,
and what must therefore be put aside to replace it. Under changing
conditions, it is quite otherwise. Here the direction of production
and the different processes involved are continually changing. Here
it is not enough to replace the used-up plant and the semi-manu­
factured oroducts consumed in similar a ualities and a uantities:
others - etter or at least better correspond ng to the new nditio s
of demand - have to take their place; or the replacement of capital
goods used in one branch of production has to be restricted in order
that another branch of production may be extended or commenced.
In order to carry out such complicated operations, it is necessary to
calculate. Without economic calculations capital calculations are
impossible. Thus in the face of one of the most fundamental problems
of economic activity, the socialist community - which has no means
of economic calculation - must be quite helpless. With the best will
in the world it will be quite unable to carry out the operations
necessary to bring production and consumption into such a balance,
that value of capital is at least maintained and only what is obtained
over and above this is consumed.
But apart from this, in itself, quite unsurmountable difficulty, the
carrying out of a rational economic policy in a socialist community
would encounter other difficulties.
To maintain and accumulate capital involves costs. It involves
sacrificing present satisfac(ions in order that greater satisfactions may
be obtained in the future. Under Capitalism the sacrifice that has to
be made is made by ,the possessors of the means of production, and
those, who, by limiting consumption, are on the way to being
possessors of �he means of production. The advantage which they
thereby procure for the future does indeed not entirely accrue to
them. They are obliged to share it with those whose incomes are

b

S O C IA L I S M U N D E R D YNA M I C C O N D I T I O NS
derived from work, since other things being equal, the accumulation
of capital increases the marginal productivity oflabour and therewith
wages. But the fact that in the main, the gain of not living beyond
their means (i.e. not consuming capital) , and saving (i.e. increasing
capital) does pay them, is a sufficient stimulus to incite them to
maintain and extend it. And this stimulus is the stronger the more
completely their immediate needs are satisfied. For the less urgent
are those present needs, which are not satisfied when provision is
made for the future, the easier it is to make the sacrifice. Under
Capitalism the maintenance and accumulation of capital is one of the
functions of the unequal distribution of property and income. Under
Socialism the maintenance and accumulation of capital are tasks for
the organized community - the State. The utility of a rational
policy is the same here as under Capitalism. The advantages will
be the same for all members of the community: the costs will be the
same also. Decisions upon matters of capital policy will be made by
the community - immediately by the economic administration,
ultimately by all the citizens. They will have to decide whether more
production goods or more consumption goods, shall be produced ­
whether methods of production which are shorter but which yield
a smaller product, or whether methods of production which are
longer but which yield a greater product shall be employed. It is
impossible to say how these majority decisions will work out.
It would be senseless to conjecture. The conditions under which
decisions will have to be made are different from what they are under
Capitalism. Under Capitalism the decision whether saving shall
take place is the concern of the thrifty and the well-to-do. Under
Socialism it is the concern of everybody, without distinction ­
therefore also of the idler and the spendthrift. Moreover, it must be
remembered that here the incentive which provides a higher standard
of life in return for saving wil1 not be present. The door would
therefore be open to demagogues. The opposition will always be
ready to prove that more could be assigneltto immediate satisfactions,
and the government will not be disinclined to maintain itself longer

Experience of the capital policy of public bodies dQes not inspire
much hope of the thriftiness of future socialist governments. In
general, new capital is created only when the necessary sums have
202

ELEMENT OF CHANGE
been raised by loans - that is from the savings of private citizens .
It is very seldom that capital is accumulated out of taxes or special
public income. On the other hand, numerous examples can be
adduced of cases in which the means of production owned by public
bodies have depreciated in value, because in order that present costs
may be relieved as much as possible, insufficient care has been taken
for the maintenance of capital.
It is true that the governments of the socialist or half-socialist
communities existing to-day are anxious to restrict consumption
for the sake of an expenditure which is generally considered as
investment and formation of new capital. Both the Soviet Govern­
ment in Russia and the Nazi Government in Germany are spending
great sums for the construction of works of a military character
and for the construction of industrial plants whose purpose it is to
make the country independent of foreign imports. A part of the
capita! \·vanted for this purpose has been provided by foreign loans ;
but the greater part has been provided by a restriction both of
home consumption and of investment of such a type which could
serve for the production of consumption goods wanted by the
people. Whether we may consider this policy as a policy of saving
and forming new capital, or not, depends on the way in which we
judge a policy whose aim it is to increase a country's military
equipment and to make its economic system independent of foreign
imports. The fact alone that consumption is restricted for the sake
of constructing big plants of different kinds is not evidence that
new capital is created. These plants will have to prove in the future
whether they will contribute to the better supply of commodities
wanted for the improvement of the economic situation of the
country.

§5
The element of change in the socialist economy
It should be already sufficiently clear from what has been said,
that under Socialism, as under any other system, there could be no
perfectly stationary state. Not only incessant changes in the natural
conditions of production would make this impossible; quite apart
20 3

S O C I A L I S M UNDER DYNA M I C C O N D I T I O N S
from these, incessant dynamic forces would be at work, in changes
in the size of the population, in the demand for commodities, and in
the quantity of capital goods. One cannot conceive these factors
eliminated from the economic system. It is thus unnecessary to
inquire whether these changes would also involve changes in the
organization of labour and the technical processes of production.
For, once the economic system ceases to be in perfect equilibrium it
is a matter of indifference whether actual innovations are thought of
and put into practice. Once everything is in a state of flux, every­
thing which happens is an innovation. Even when the old is repeated,
it is an innovation because, under new conditions, it will have
different effects. It is an innovation in its consequences.
But this is not in the least to say that the socialist system will be a
progressive system. Economic change and economic progress are by
no means ODe and the same thing. That an economic system is not
stationary is no proof that it is progressing. Economic change is
necessitated by the fact of changes in the conditions under which
economic activity takes place. When conditions change the economic
system must change also. Economic progress, however, consists only
in change which takes place in a quite definite direction, towards the
goal of all economic activity, e.g. the greatest possible wealth. (This
conception of progress is quite free from implications of subjective
judgment.) When more, or the same number of people are better
provided for, then the economic system is progressive. That tl?-e
difficulties of measuring value make it impossible to measure progress
exactly, and that it is by no means certain that it makes men
'happier', are matters which do not concern us here.
Progress can take place in many ways. Organization can be
improved.
The tech�ique of production can be made more
efficient, the quantity of capital can be increased. In short, many
paths lead to this goal. 1 Wowd socialist society be able to follow
them?
We may assume that it would entrust the most suitable people to
direct production. But, however talented they were, how would
they be able to act rationally if they were unable to reckon, to make
calculations?
On this difficulty alone Socialism must surely
founder.
1 On the difficulties a socialist economy must put in the way of the invention and,
even more, of the realization of technical improvements, see Dietzel, Technischer Fort­
IClrritt und Freiheit der Wirtschaft, Bonn and Leipzig 1922, p. 47 et I/lq.

S PECULAT I ON

§6
Speculation
In any economic system which is in process of change all economic
activity is based upon an uncertain future. It is therefore bound up
with risk. It is essentially speculation.
The great majority of people, not knowing how to speculate
successfully, and socialist writers of all shades of opinion, speak very
ill of speculation. The literateur and the bureaucrat, both alien to an
atmosphere of business activity, are filled with envy and rage when
they think of fortunate speculators and successful entrepreneurs. To
their resentment we owe the efforts of many writers on economics to
discover subtle distinctions between speculation on the one hand
and 'legitimate trade', 'value creating production', etc., on the other. 1
In reality all economic activity outside the stationary state is specula­
tion. Between the work of the humble artisan who promises to
deliver a pair of shoes within a week at a fixed price, and the sinking
of a coal mine based upon conjectures with regard to the disposal of
its products years hence, there is only a difference of degree. Even
those who invest in gilt-edged fixed-interest-bearing securities
speculate - quite apart from the risk of the debtor's inability to pay.
They buy money for future delivery - just as speculators in cotton
buy cotton for future delivery. Economic activity is necessarily
speculative because it is based upon an uncertain future. Speculation
is the link that binds isolated economic action to the economic
activity of society as a whole.
It is customary to attribute the notoriously low productivity of
government undertakings to the fact that the persons employed are
not sufficiently interested in the success of their labours. If once it
were possible to lift each citizen to such a plane that he could
1 See the pertinent criticism of these efforts which are evidence of good intentions
rather than of scientific sharpness of thought, in Michaelis, Volkswirtschaftlidre
Schriften, Berlin 1873 , p. 3 et seq., and by Petritsch, Zur Lehre von der UberwalflUng der
Steuern .mt besonderer Beziehung auf den BIi..senverkehr, Graz 1903, p. z8 et seq. Of
Adolf Wagner, Petritsch says that 'although he likes to call economic life an "organism"
and wants to have it considered as such, and although he always stresses the interest of
the community against that of individuals, yet in concrete economic problems he does
not get beyond the individuals and their more or less moral aims, and wilfully over­
looks the organic connection between these and other economic phenomena. Thus
he ends where, strictly speaking, should be the starting point, not the end, of every
economic investigation' (p. 59). The same is true of all writers who have thundered
against speculation.

S O C IA L I S M U N D E R D YN A M I C C O N D I T I O N S
realize the connection between his own efforts and the social income,
part of which belongs to him, if once his character could be so
strengthened that he would remain steadfast in the face of all
temptations to idle, then government undertakings would not be
less productive than those of the private entrepreneur. The problem
of socialization appears thus to be a problem of ethics. To make
Socialism possible it is only necessary to raise men sufficiently above
the state of ignorance and immorality to which they have been
degraded during the terrible epoch of Capitalism. Until this plane
has been reached bonuses and so on must be employed to make men
more diligent.
It has already been shown that, under Socialism, the lack of an
adequate stimulus to the individual to overcome the disutility of
labour must have the effect of lowering productivity. This difficulty
would arise even in a stationary state. Under dynamic conditions
there arises another, the difficulty of speculation.
In an economic system based upon private ownership of the
means of production, the speculator is interested in the result of his
speculation in the highest possible degree. If it succeeds, then, in the
first instance, it is his gain. If it fails, then, he is the first to feel the
loss. The speculator works for the community, but he himself feels
the success or failure of his action proportionately more than the
community. As profit or loss, they appear much greater in proportion
to his means than to the total resources of society. The more success­
fully he speculates the more means of production are at his disposal,
the greater becomes his influence on the business of society. The less
successfully he speculates the smaller becomes his property, the less
becomes his influence in business. If he loses everything by specula­
tion he disappears from the ranks of those who are called to the
direction of economic affairs.
Under Socialism it is quite different. Here the leader of industry
is interested in profit and loss only in so far as he participates in them
as a citizen - one among millions. On his actions depends the fate of
all. He can lead the nation to riches. He can just as well lead it to
poverty and want. His genius can bring prosperity to the race. His
incapacity, or his indifference, can bring it to destruction and decay.
In his hands lie happiness and misery as in the hands of a god. And
he must indeed be god-like to accomplish what he has to do. His
vision must include everything which is of significance to the
206

SPECULATION
community. His judgment must be unfailing; he must be able
rightly to weigh the conditions of distant parts and future centuries.
That Socialism would be immediately practicable if an omni­
potent and omniscient Deity were personally to descend to take in
hand the government of human affairs, is incontestable. But so long
as this event cannot definitely be counted upon, it is not to be
expected that men will be ready freely to grant such a position to any
one out of their midst. One of the fundamental facts of all social life,
which all reformers must take into account, is that men have their
own thoughts and their own wills. It is not to be supposed that they
would suddenly, of their own free will, make themselves for all time
the passive tools of Q1!1one out of their midst - even though he were
the wisest and best of them all.
But so long as the possibility of a single individual permanently
planning the direction of affairs is excluded, it is necessary to fall
back upon the majority decisions of committees, general assemblies
and, in the last resort, the whole enfranchised population. But there­
with arises the danger on which all collectivist undertakings inevit­
ably come to grief - the crippling of initiative and the sense of
responsibility. Innovations are not introduced because the majority
of the members of the governing body cannot be induced to consent
to them.
Things would not be made any better by the fact that the
impossibility of leaving all decisions to a single man, or a single
committee, would lead to the creation ofinnumerable sub-committees
by which decisions would be taken. All such sub-committees would
only be delegates of the one supreme authority which, as an economic
system working according to a unitary plan, is implied by the very
nature of Socialism. They would necessarily be bound by the
instructions of the supreme authority and this, in itself, would
breed irresponsibility.
We all know the appearance of the apparatus of socialist ad­
ministration: a countless multitude of office holders, each zealously
bent on preserving his position and preventing anybody from
intruding on his sphere of activity - yet at the same time anxiously
endeavoi'iring to throw all responsibili of action on to somebody else .
For all its officiousness, such a bureaucracy offers a classic
example of human indolence. Nothing stirs when no external
stimulus is present. In the nationalized concerns, existing within a

ty

207

SOCIALISM UNDER DYNAMIC CONDITIONS
society based for the most part on private ownership of the means of
production, all stimulus to improvements in process comes from those
entrepreneurs who as contractors for semi-manufactured articles and
machines hope to make a profit by them. The heads of the concern
itself seldom, if ever, make innovations. They content themselves
with imitating what goes on in similar privately-owned under­
takings. But where all concerns are socialized there will be hardly
any talk of reforms and improvements.

§7
Joint stock companies and the socialist economy
One of the current fallacies of socialism is that joint stock
companies are a preliminary stage of the socialist undertaking. The
heads ofjoint stock companies - it is argued - are not owners of the
means of production, and yet the undertakings flourish under their
direction. If, in place of the shareholders, society should assume the
function of ownership, things would not be altered. The directors
would not work worse for society than they would for the share­
holders.
This notion that in the joint stock company the entrepreneur­
function is solely the shareholder's, and that all the organs of the
company are active only as the shareholders' employees, pervades
also legal theory, and it has been attempted to make it the basis of
Company Law. It is responsible for the fact that the business idea,
which underlies the creation of the joint stock company, has been
falsified, and that up to to-day people have been unable to find for
the joint stock company a legal form which would enable it to
work without friction, and that the company system everywhere
suffers from grave abuses.
In fact there have never and nowhere been prosperous j oint stock
companies corresponding to the ideal etatistic jurists have created.
Success has always been attained only by those companies whose
directors have predominant personal interest in the prosperity of the
company. The vital force and the effectiveness of the joint stock
company lie in a partnership between the company's real managers
- who generally have power to dispose over part, if not the majority
of the share-capital - and the other shareholders. Only where
these directors have the same interest in the prosperity of the under-

208

S T O C K C O M P A N I E S S O C I A L IS T

ECONOMY

taking as every owner, only where their interests coincide with the
shareholder's interests, is the business carried on in the interests of the
joint stock company. Where the directors have interests other than
those of a part, or of the majority, or of all of the shareholders,
business is carried on against the company's interests. For in all
joint stock companies that do not wither in bureaucracy, those who
really are in power always manage business in their own interests,
whether this coincides with the shareholders' interests or not. It is
an unavoidable presupposition of the prosperity of the companies,
that those in power shall receive a large part of the profits of the
enterprise and that they shall be primarily affected by the mis­
fortunes of the enterprise. In all flourishing joint stock companies,
such men, immaterial of what their legal status is, wield the decisive
influence. The type of man to whom joint stock companies owe their
success is not the type of general manager who resembles the public
officiai in his ways of thought, himseif often an ex-public servant
whose most important qualification is good connection with those in
political power. It is the manager who is interested himself through
his shares, it is the promoter and the founder - these are responsible
for prosperity.
Socialist-etatistic theory of course will not admit this. It en­
deavours to force the joint stock company into a legal form in which
it must languish. It refuses to see in those who guide the company
anything except officials, for the etatist wants to think of the whole
world as inhabited only by officials. It is allied with the organized
employees and workers in their resentment-ridden fight against the
high sums paid to the management, believing that the profits of the
business arise of themselves and are reduced by whatever is paid to
the men in charge. Finally, it turns also against the share­
holder. The latest German doctrine does not want, 'in view of the
evolution of the concept of fair play', to let the shareholder's
self-interest decide, but rather 'the interest and well-being of the
enterprise, itself, namely its own economic, legal and sociological
value, independent of transient majorities of transient shareholders'.
It wants to create for the administration of the companies a position
of power, which should make them independent of the will of those
who have put up the majority of the share-capital. 1

That 'altruistic motives' or the like are ever decisive in the
administration of successful joint stock companies is a fable. Such
attempts to model Company Law after the illusory ideal of etatistic
politicians, have not succeeded in making the joint stock company
a piece of the illusory 'functional economy' ; they have however
damaged the joint stock company form of enterprise.

The fundamental problems of a socialist economy under conditions of change
HE preceding investigations have shown the difficulties confront­

T ing the establishment of a socialist order ofsociety.

In a socialist
community the possibility of economic calculations is lacking: it is
therefore impossible to ascertain the cost and result of an economic
operation or to make the result of the calculation the test of the
operation. This in itself would be sufficient to make Socialism
impracticable. But, quite apart from that, another insurmountable
obstacle stands in its way. It is impossible to find a form of organiza­
tion which makes the economic action of the individual independent
of the co-operation of other citizens without leaving it open to all the
risks of mere gambling. These are the two problems, and without
their solution the realization of Socialism appears impracticable
unless in a completely stationary state.
Too little attention has hitherto been given to these fundamental
questions. The first has generally been almost ignored. The reason
for this is that people have not been able to get rid of the idea that
labour time can afford an efficient measure of value. But even many
of those who recognize that the labour theory of value is untenable
continue to believe that value can be measured. The frequent
attempts which have been made to discover a standard of value
prove this. To understand the problem of economic calculation it
was necessary to recognize the true character of the exchange
relations expressed in the prices of the market.
The existence of this important problem could be revealed only
by the methods of the modern subjective theory of value. In actual
practice although the tendency has been all in the direction of
Socialism, the problem has not become so urgent as to attract general
attention.
It is quite otherwise with the second problem. The more
211

THE I M PRACTI CABILITY OF S O C I A L I S M
communal enterprise extends, the more attention is drawn to the
bad business results of nationalized and municipalized undertakings.
It is impossible to miss the cause of the difficulty: a child could see
where something was lacking. So that it cannot be said that this
problem has not been tackled. But the way in which it has been
tackled has been deplorably inadequate. Its organic connection
with the essential nature of socialist enterprise has been regarded as
merely a question of better selection of persons. It has not been
realized that even exceptionally gifted men of high character cannot
solve the problems created by socialist control of industry.

§2
Attempted solutions
As far as most socialists are concerned, recognition of these
problems is obstructed, not only by their rigid adherence to the
labour theory of value but also by their whole conception of economic
activity. They fail to realize that industry must be constantly
changing : their conception of the socialist community is always
static. As long as they are criticizing the capitalist order they deal
throughout with the phenomena of a progressive economy and they
paint in glaring colours the friction caused by economic change. But
they seem to regard all change and not only the friction caused by
it, as a peculiar attribute of the capitalist order. In the happy
kingdom of the future everything will develop without movement or
friction.
We can see this best if we think of the picture of the entrepreneur
which is generally drawn by socialists. In such a picture the entre­
preneur is characterized only by the special way he derives his
income. Clearly any analysis of the capitalist order must take as its
central point not capital nor the capitalists but the entrepreneur.
But Socialism, including Marxian Socialism, sees in the entre­
preneur someone alien to the process of production, someone whose
whole work consists in the appropriation of surplus value. It will be
sufficient to expropriate these parasites to bring about a socialist
society. The recollection of the liberation of the peasants and the
abolition of slavery hovers vaguely in Marx's mind and even more so
in the minds of many other socialists. But they fail to see that the
212

ATT E M PTED S O L UTI ONS
pOSitIOn of the feudal lord was quite different from that of the
entrepreneur. The feudal lord had no influence on production. He
stood outside the process of production : only when it was finished did
he step in with a claim to a share in the yield . But in so far as the
lord of the manor and the slave owner were also leaders of production
they retained their position even after the abolition of serfdom and
slavery. The fact that henceforward they had to give the workers the
value of their labour did not change their economic function. But
the entrepreneur fulfils a task which must be performed even in a
socialist community. This the Socialist does not see; or at least
refuses to see.
Socialism's misunderstanding of the entrepreneur degenerates
into idiosyncrasy whenever the word speculator is mentioned. Even
Marx, unmindful of the good resolutions which animated him,
proceeds entirely along 'petty bourgeois' lines in this connection and
his schooi has even surpassed him. Ali sociaiists overlook the fact
that even in a socialist community every economic operation must
be based on an uncertain future, and that its
remains uncertain even if it is

economic consequence
technically successful. They see in the

uncertainty which leads to speculation a consequence of the anarchy
of production, whilst in fact it is a necessary result of changing
economic conditions.
The great mass of people are incapable of realizing that in
economic life nothing is permanent except change. They regard the
existing state of affairs as eternal; as it has been so shall it always be.
But even if they were in a position to envision the 7tclV1'1X « PEL they
would be baffled by the problems to be solved. To see and to act
in advance, to follow new ways, is always the concern only of the
few, the leaders. Socialism is the economic policy of the crowd, of
the masses, remote from insight into the nature of economic activity.
Socialist theory is the precipitate of their views on economic matters
- it is created and supported by those who find economic life alien,
and do not comprehend it.
Among socialists only Saint Simon realized to some extent the
position of the entrepreneurs in the capitalistic economy. As a result
he is often denied the name of SoC'ialist. The others completely fail to
realize that the functions of entrepreneurs in the capitalist order
must be performed in a socialist community also. This is reflected
most clearly in the writings of Lenin. According to him the work

213

THE I MPRA CT I CA B I L I TY O F S O C I A L I S M
performed in a capitalist order by those whom he refused to designate
as 'working' can be boiled down to 'Auditing of Production and
Distribution' and 'keeping the records of labour and products' .
This could easily be attended to by the armed workers, 'by the whole
of the armed people'. 1 Lenin quite rightly separates these functions
of the 'capitalists and clerks' from the work of the technically trained
higher personnel, not however missing the opportunity to take a side
thrust at scientifically trained people by giving expression to that
contempt for all highly skilled work which is characteristic ofMarxian
proletarian snobbishness. 'This recording, this exercise of audit,'
he says, 'Capitalism has simplified to the utmost and has reduced to

extremely simple operations of superintendence and book-entry
within the grasp of anyone able to read and write. To control these
operations a knowledge of elementary arithmetic and the drawing of
correct receipts is sufficient.'1 It is therefore possible straightway to
enable all members of society to do these things for themselves.' This
is all, absolutely all that Lenin had to say on this problem; and no
socialist has a word more to say. They have no greater perception of
the essentials of economic life than the errand boy, whose only idea of
the work of the entrepreneur is that he covers pieces of paper with

letters and figures.
It was for this reason that it was quite impossible for Lenin to
realize the causes of the failure of his policy. In his life and his
reading he remained so far removed from the facts of economic life
that he was as great a stranger to the work of the bourgeoisie as a
Hottentot to the work of an explorer taking geographical measure­
ments. When he saw that his work could proceed no further on the
original lines he decided to rely no longer on references to 'armed
workers' in order to compel the 'bourgeois' experts to co-operate :
instead they were to receive 'high remuneration' for 'a short transition
period' so that they could set the socialist order going and thus render
themselves superfluous. He even thought it possible that this would
take place within a year.'
Those socialists who do not think of the socialist community as
the strongly centralized organization conceived by their more clear­
headed brethren and which alone is logically conceivable, believe

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS
that the difficulties confronting the management of industry can be
solved by democratic institutions inside undertakings. They believe
that individual industries could be allowed to conduct their opera­
tions with a certain degree of independence without endangering the
uniformity and the correct co-ordination of industry.

If every

enterprise were placed under the control of a workers' committee, no
further difficulties could exist. In all this there is a whole crop of
fallacies and errors.

The problem of economic management with

which we are here concerned lies much less in the work of individual
industries than in harmonizing the work of individual concerns in
the whole economic system. It deals with such questions as dissolving,
extending, transforming and limiting existing undertakings and
establishing new undertakings - matters which can never be decided
by the workers of one industry. The problems of conducting an
industry stretch far beyond the individual concern.
State and municipal Socialism have supplied enough unfavourable
experience to compel the closest attention to the problem of economic
control. But etatists in general have treated this problem no less
inadequately than those who have dealt with it in Bolshevik Russia.
General opinion seems to regard the main evil of communal under­
takings to be due to the fact that they are not run on 'business' lines.
Now rightly understood this catchword could lead to a correct view
on the problem. Communal enterprise does indeed lack the spirit
of the business man, and the very problem for Socialism here is to
create something to put in its place. But the catchword is not under­
stood in this way at all. It is an offspring of the bureaucratic mind :
that is to say it comes from people for whom all human activity
represents the fulfilment of formal official and professional duties.
Officialdom classifies activity according to the capacity for under­
taking it formally acquired by means of examinations and a certain
period of service. 'Training' and 'length of service' are the only
things which the official brings to the �ob'. If the work of a body of
officials appears unsatisfactory, there can be only one explanation:
the officials have not had the right training, and future appointments
must be made differendy. It is therefore proposed that a different
training should be required of fllture candidates. If only the officials
of the communal undertaking came with a business training, the
undertaking would be more business-like. But for the official who
cannot enter into the spirit of capitalist industry this means nothing
215

THE I M PRACT I CA B I L ITY O F S O C I A L I S M
more than certain external manifestations of business technique:
prompter replies to inquiries, the adoption of certain technical office
appliances, which have not yet been sufficiently introduced into the
departments, such as typewriters, copying machines, etc., the reduc­
tion of unnecessary duplication, and other things. In this way 'the
business spirit' penetrates into the offices of communal enterprise.
And people are greatly surprised when these men trained on these
lines, also fail, fail even worse than the much-maligned civil servants,
who in fact, show themselves superior at least in formal schooling.
It is not difficult to expose the fallacies inherent in such notions.
The attributes of the business man cannot be divorced from the
position of the entrepreneur in the capitalist order. 'Business' is not
in itself a quality innate in a person ; only the qualities of mind and
character essential to a business man can be inborn. Still less is it an
accomplishment which can be acquired by study, though the
knowledge and the accomplishments needed by a business man can
be taught and learned. A man does not become a business man by
passing some years in commercial training or in a commercial insti­
tute, nor by a knowledge of book-keeping and the jargon of
commerce, nor by a skill in languages and typing and shorthand.
These are things which the clerk requires. But the clerk is not a
business man, even though in ordinary speech he may be called a
'trained business man' .
When these obvious truths became clear in the end the experiment
was tried of making entrepreneurs, who had worked successfully for
many years, the managers of public enterprises. The result was
lamentable. They did no better than the others ; furthermore they
lacked the sense for formal routine which distinguishes the life-long
official. The reason was obvious. An entrepreneur deprived of his
characteristic role in economic life ceases to be a business man.
However much experience and routine he may bring to his new task
he will still only be an official in it.
It is just as useless to attempt to solve the problem by new
methods of remuneration. It is thought that if the managers of
public enterprises were better paid, competition for these posts wouid
arise and make it possible to select the best men. Many go even
further and believe that the difficulties will be overcome by granting
the managers a share in the profits. It is significant that these
proposals have hardly ever been put in practice, although they
216

CAPITALI S M

THE

ONLY

SOLUTION

appear quite practicable as long as public undertakings exist along­
side private enterprises, and as long as the possibility of economic

calculation permits the ascertainment of the result achieved by the
public enterprise which is not the case under pure Socialism. But
the problem is not nearly so much the question of the manager's
share in the profit, as of his share in the losses which arise through his
conduct of business. Except in a purely moral sense the property-less
manager of a public undertaking can be made answerable only for a

comparatively small part of the losses. To make a man materially
interested in profits and hardly concerned in losses simply encourages

a lack of seriousness. This is the experience, not only of public under­
takings but also of all private enterprises, which have granted to
comparatively poor employees in managerial posts rights to a

percentage of the profits.
It is an evasion of the problem to put one's faith in the hope that
the moral purification of mankind. which the socialists expect to
occur when their aims are realized, will of itself make eve thing
perfectly right. Whether Socialism will or will not ' have the moral

ry

effect expected from it may here be conveniently left undecided. But
the problems with which we are concerned do not arise from the

moral shortcomings of humanity. They are problems of the logic of
will and action which must arise at all times and in all places.

§3
Capitalism the onlY solution
But let us disregard the fact that up to now all socialist efforts have

been baffled by these problems, and let us attempt to trace out the
lines on which the solution ought to be sought.

Only by making

such an attempt can we throw any light on the question whether such

a solution is possible in the framework of a socialist order of society.
The first step which would be necessary would be to form sections
inside the socialist community to which the management of definite
branches of business would be entrusted. & long as the industry of a
socialist community is directed by one single authority which makes
all arrangements and bears all the responsibility, a solution of the
problems is inconceivable, because all the other workers are only

217

T H E I M P R A C T IC A B I L I T Y O F S O C I A L I S M
acting instruments without independent delimited spheres of opera­
tion and consequently without any special responsibility. What we
must aim at is precisely the possibility not only of supervising and
controlling the whole process, but of considering and judging
separately the subsidiary processes which take place within a
narrower sphere.
In this respect at least, our procedure runs parallel to all past
attempts to solve our problem. It is clear to everyone that the desired
aim can be achieved only if responsibility is built up from below. We
must therefore start from a single industry or from a single branch of
industry. It is quite immaterial which unit is taken as a convenient
basis. It makes no difference whether the unit with which we start
is large or small since the same principle which we have once used
for our division can be again used when it is necessary to divide too

often the division shall be made is the question how in spite of the
division of industry into parts we can preserve that unity of co­
operation without which a social economy is impossible.
We imagine then the economic order of the socialist community
to be divided into any number of parts each of which is put in the
charge of a particular manager. Every manager of a section is
charged with the full responsibility for his operations. This means
that the profit or a very considerable part of the profit accrues to
him; on the other hand the burden oflosses falls upon him, insomuch
as the means ofproduction which he squanders through bad measures
will not be replaced by society. If he squanders all the means of
production under his care he ceases to be manager of a section and is
reduced to the ranks of the masses.
If this personal responsibility of the section manager is not to be
a mere sham, then his operations must be clearly marked off from
that of other managers. Everything he receives from other section
managers in the form of raw materials or partly manufactured goods
for further working or for use as instruments in his section and all
the work which he gets performed in his section will be debited to
him; everything he delivers to other sections or for consumption win
be credited to him. It is necessary, however, that he should be left
free choice to decide what machines, raw materials, partly manufac­
tured goods, and labour forces he will employ in his section and what
he will produce in it. If he is not given this freedom he cannot be

218

CAPITA L I S M

THE

O N LY

burdened with any responsibility. For it would not be his fault if at
the command of the supreme controlling authority he had produced
something for which, under existing conditions, there was no
corresponding demand, or if his section was handicapped because it
received its material from other sections in an unsuitable condition,
or, what comes to the same thing, at too high a charge. In the first

event, the failure of his section would be attributable to the disposi­
tions of the supreme control, in the latter to the failures of the sections
which produced the material. But on the other hand the community
must also be free to claim the same rights which it allows to the
section manager. This means that it takes the products which he has
produced only according to its requirements, and only ifit can obtain
them at the lowest rate of charge, and it charges him with the labour,
which it supplies to him at the highest rate it is in a position to
obtain : that is to say it supplies the labour to the highest bidder.
Society as a production community now falls into three groups.
The supreme direction forms one. Its function is merely to supervise
the orderly course of the process of production as a whole, the
execution of which is completely detailed to the section managers.
The third group is the citizens who are not in the service of the
supreme administration and are not section managers. Between the
two groups stand the section managers as a special group : they have
received from the community once and for all at the beginning of the
regime an allotment of the means of production for which they have
had to pay nothing, and they continue to receive from it the labour
force of the members of the third group, who are assigned to the
highest bidders amongst them. The central administration which
has to credit each member of the third group with everything it has
received from the section managers for his labour power, or, in case

it employs him directly in its own sphere of operation, with every­
thing which it might have received from the section managers for his
labour power, will then distribute the consumption goods to the
highest bidders amongst the citizens of all three groups. The pro­
ceeds will be credited to the section managers who have delivered the
products.
.
By such an arrangement of the community, the section manager
can be made fully responsible for his doings. The sphere for which
he bears responsibility is sharply delimited from that for which others
bear the responsibility. Here we are no longer faced with the total

lUg

THE IMPRA C T I CAB I L ITY O F S O CIAL I S M
result of the economic activity of the whole industrial community in
which the contribution of one individual cannot be distinguished
from that of another. The 'productive contribution' of each indi­
vidual section manager is open to separate judgment, as is also that
of each individual citizen in the three groups.
It is clear that the section managers must be permitted to change,
extend or contract their section according to the prevailing course of
demand on the part of the citizens as indicated in the market for
consumption goods. They must therefore be in a position to sell
those means of production in their section which are more urgently
required in other sections, to these other sections : and they ought to
demand as much for them as they can obtain under the existing
conditions. . . .
But we need not carry the analysis further. For what are we
cor£ronted vY1L� but the capitalist order of societ'f
the only form of
economy in which strict application of the principle of the personal
responsibility of every individual citizen is possible. Capitalism is
that form of social economy in which all the deficiencies of the
socialist system described above are made good. Capitalism is the
only conceivable form of social economy which is appropriate to the
fulfilment of the demands which society makes of any economic
organization.

The spatial extent of the socialist communiry
ARI.V Socialism is marked by its predilection for a return to the

E simpler modes of production of primitive times.

Its ideal is the

self-sufficing village, or, at most, the self-sufficing province - a town
around which a number of villages are grouped. Being averse to all
trade and commerce, its protagonists regard foreign trade as some­
thing entirely evil which must be abolished. Foreign Trade intro­
duces superfluous commodities into the country. Since it was once
possible to do without them, it is obvious that they are unnecessary,
and that only the extreme ease with which they can be procured is
responsible for the unnecessary expenditure upon them. Foreign
Trade undermines morality and introduces foreign ideas and customs.
In Utopia the stoic ideal of self-mastery was transmuted into the
economic ideal of self-sufficiency. Plutarch found it an admirable
thing in Lycurgusan Sparta - as romantically conceived in his day
- that no merchant ship ever entered her harbours. 1
This attachment to the ideal of economic self-sufficiency, and their
complete incapacity to understand the nature of trade and com­
merce, led the Utopians to overlook the problem of the territorial
limits of the ideal state. Whether the borders of fairyland are to be
wider or narrower in extent does not enter into their considerations.
In the tiniest village there is space enough to realize their plans. In
this way it was possible to think of realizing Utopia tentatively in
small instalments. Owen founded the New Harmony community
in Indiana. Cabet founded a small Icaria in Texas. Considerant
founded a model phalanstery in the same state. 'Duodecimo editions
of the New Jerusalem,' jeers the communist manifesto.
It was only gradually that socialists came to perceive that the self1 Poehlmann, Geschichte der sozialen Frage und des Sozialismus in der antiken Welt,

sufficiency of a small area could provide no foundation for Socialism.
Thompson, a disciple of Owen, remarked that the realization of
equality among the members of one community was far from
signifying the realization of equality between the members of dif­
ferent communities. Under the influence of this discovery, he turned
to centralized Socialism. 1 St. Simon and his school were thorough
centralizers. Pecqueur's schemes of reform claimed to be national
and universal. I
Thus emerges a problem pecqliar to Socialism. Can Socialism
exist within limited areas of the earth's surface? Or is it necessary
that the entire inhabited world should constitute a unitary socialistic
community?

§2
Marxian treatment of this problem
For the marxian, there can be only one solution of this problem ­
the recumenical solution.
Marxism, indeed, proceeds from the assumption that by an inner
necessity, Capitalism has already set its mark upon the whole world.
Even to-day Capitalism is not limited to a single nation or to a small
group of nations. Even to-day it is international and cosmopolitan.
' Instead of the old local and national isolation and self-sufficiency,
world trade has developed and the interdependence of nations.'
The cheapness of their commodities is the 'heavy artillery' of the
bourgeoisie. With the aid of this it compels all nations, on pain of
extinction, to adopt bourgeois methods of production. 'It forces
them to adopt so-called civilization, i.e. to become bourgeois. In a
word, it creates a world after its own image.' And this is true not
only of material but also of intellectual production. 'The intellectual
productions of one nation become the common property of all.
National nan'owness and exclusiveness become daily more impossible,
and out of the many national and local literatures a world literature
arises."
It follows, therefore, from the logic of the materialist interpreta­
tion of history hat Socialism too can be no national, but only an

international phenomenon. It is a phase not merely in the history

of a single nation, but in the history of the whole human race. In
the logic of Marxism the question whether this or that nation is
'ripe' for Socialism cannot even be asked. Capitalism makes the

world ripe for Socialism, not a single nation or a single industry. The
expropriators, through whose expropriation the last step towards

Socialism must be taken, must not be conceived save as major

capitalists whose capital is invested throughout the whole world.
For the marxian, therefore, the socialistic experiments of the
'Utopians' are just as senseless as Bismarck's facetious proposal to

introduce Socialism experimentally into one of the Polish districts of

the Prussian State. 1 Socialism is an historical process.

therefore, the problem of the autarky ofa socialist community cannot

Later marxians have, indeed, recognized that, at any rate for a

time, the existence of many independent socialist communities side

by side must be anticipated.2 But, once this is conceded one must
go further and also take into account the possibility of one or more

socialist communities existing within a world which, for the most

part, is still capitalistic.

§3
Liberalism and the problem of the frontiers
When Marx and, with him, the majority of recent writers on
Socialism consider Socialism only as realized in a unitary world

state, they overlook powerful forces that work against economic

unification.
The levity with which they dispose of all these problems may not
unreasonably be attributed to what, as we shall see, was an entirely
unjustifiable acceptance of an attitude with regard to the future
political organization of the world, which was prevalent at the time

SOCIALISM

when Marxism was taking form. At that time, liberals held that all
regional and national divisions could be regarded as political
atavisms. The liberal doctrine of free trade and protection had been
propounded - irrefutable for all time. It had been shown that all
limitations on trade were to the disadvantage of all concerned : and,
arguing from this, it had been attempted with success to limit the
functions of the state to the production of security. For Liberalism
the problem of the frontiers of the state does not arise. If the func­
tions of the state are limited to the protection of life and property
against murder and theft, it is no longer of any account to whom this
or that land belongs. Whether the state extended over a wider or a
narrower territory, seemed a matter of indifference to an age which
was shattering tariff barriers and assimilating the legal and
administrative systems of single states to a common form. In the
middle of the nineteenth century, optimistic liberals could regard
the idea of a League of Nations, a true world-state, as practicable in
the not too far distant future.
The liberals did not sufficiently consider that greatest of
hindrances to the development of universal free trade - the problem
of races and nationalities. But the socialists overlooked completely
that this constituted an infinitely greater hindrance to the deVelop­
ment of a socialistic society. Their incapacity to go beyond Ricardo
in all matters of economics, and their complete failure to understand
all questions of nationalism, made it impossible for them even to
conceive this problem .

MigratIOn and di.fJl�rences in national conditions

F trade were completely free, production would only take place
I under the most suitahle conditions. Raw materials would be pro­
duced in those parts which, taking everything into account, would
yield the highest product.

Manufacture would be localized where

the transport charges, including those necessary to place the com­
modities in the hands of the ultimate consumer, were at a minimum.

As labour settles around the centres of production, the geographical
distribution of population would necessarily adapt itself to the
natural conditions of production.
Natural conditions, however, are unchanging only in a stationary
economic system. The forces of change are continually transforming
them. In a changing economy men migrate continually from the
places where conditions are le�s favourable to places where they are
more favourable for production. Under Capitalism the stress of
competition tends to direct labour and capital to the most suitable
places. In a closed socialist community the same result would have
to be achieved by administrative decree. In both cases the principle
would be the same: men would have to go where the conditions of
life were most favourable. 1

These migrations have the closest bearing upon the condition of
the different nations. They cause citizens of one nation, the natural
conditions of which are less favourable, to move into the territory of
other nations more favourably endowed. If the conditions under
which migration takes place are such that the immigrants are
assimilated to their new surroundings then the nation from which
they came is, to that extent, weakened in numbers. If they arc such

M I GRATION UNDER S O C I A L I S M
that the immigrants preserve their nationality in their new home -

still more if they assimilate the original inhabitants - then the nation
receiving them will find immigration a menace to its national
position.
To be a member of a national minority involves multitudinous
political disadvantages. 1 The wider the functions of the political
authority the more burdensome are these disadvantages. They are

smallest in the state which is founded upon purely liberal principles.
They are greatest in the state which is founded upon Socialism. The
more they are felt, the greater become the efforts of each nation to
protect its members from the fate of belonging to a national minority.
To wax in numbers, to be a majority in rich and extensive territories

these become highly desirable political aims. But this is nothing but
Imperialism.' In the last decades of the nineteenth century, and the

first decades of the twentieth, the favourite weapons of Imperialism
were commercial weapons- protective tariffs, prohibitions ofimports,
premiums on exports, freight discriminations, and the like. Less
attention was paid to the use of another powerful imperialistic
weapon - limitations on emigration and immigration. This is
becoming more significant now. The

ultima ratio

of imperialism is,

however, war. Beside war, all other weapons that it may use appear
merely insufficient auxiliaries.
Nothing justifies us in assuming that under Socialism the dis­

advantages of belonging to a national minority would be diminished.
On the contrary. The more the individual depended on the State ­
the more importance political decisions had for the life of the

individual - the more would the national minority feel the political
impotence to which it was condemned.

But when we are considering migration under Socialism we need

not give special attention to the friction which would arise there­
from between nations. For under Socialism there must arise, even

between members of one and the same nation, points of difference
which make the division of the surface of the earth - which is a
matter of indifference to Liberalism - a problem of cardinal
importance.

§2
The tendency towards decentralization under Socialism
Under Capitalism, capital and labour move until marginal
utilities are everywhere equal. Equilibrium is attained when the
marginal productivity of all capital and labour is the same.
Let us leave the movement of capital on one side and consider
first the movement of labour. The migrating workers depress the
marginal productivity of labour wherever they betake themselves.
The fact that wages, their income, sink, directly damages the workers
who were employed in centres of migration before the incursion of
:new workers took place. They regard the 'immigrants' as the
enemy of high wages. Their particular interest would be served by a
prohibition of 'immigration'. It becomes a cardinal point of the
parti<:ularist policy of all such particular groups of workers to keep
newcomers out.
It has been the task of Liberalism to show who bear the costs of
such a policy. The first to be injured are the workers in the less
favourably situated centres of production, who, on account of the
lower marginal productivity of their labour in those centres, have to
content themselves with lower wages. At the same time, the owners of
the more favourably situated means of production suffer through not
being able to obtain the product which they might obtain could they
employ a larger number of workers. But this is not the end of the
matter. A system which protects the immediate interests of particular
groups limits productivity in general and, in the end, injures every�
body - even those whom it began by favouring, How protection
finally affects the individual, whether he gains or loses, compared
with what he would have got under complete freedom of trade,
depends on the degrees of protection to him and to others. Although,
under protection, the total produce is lower than it would have been
under free trade, so that the average income is necessarily lower, it is
still quite possible that certain individuals may do better than they
would under free trade. The greater the protection afforded to
particular interests, the greater the damage to the community as a
whole, and to that extent the smaller the probability that single
individuals gain thereby more than they lose.
As soon as it is possible to forward private interests in this way and
22 9

MIGRATION UNDER SO CIALISM
to obtain special privileges, a struggle for pre-eminence breaks out
among those interested. Each tries to get the better of the other.
Each tries to get more privileges so as to reap the greater private gain.
The idea of perfectly equal protection for all is the fantasy of an ill­
thought out theory.

For, if all particular interests were equally

protected, nobody would reap any advantage : the only result would
be that all would feel the disadvantage of the curtailment of pro·,
ductivity equally. Only the hope of obtaining for himself a degree of
protection, which will benefit him as compared with the less pro­
tected, makes protection attractive to the individual. It is always
demanded by those who have the power to acquire and preserve
especial privileges for themselves.
In exposing the effects of protection, Liberalism broke the
aggressive power of particular interests. It now became obvious that,
at best. onlv a few could lZain absolutelv' bv protection and privile�es
and that the great majority must inevitab l lose. This d�monst;a­

y

tion deprived such systems of the support of the masses. Privilege
fell because it lost popularity.
In order to rehabilitate protection, it was necessary to destroy
Liberalism. This was attempted by a double attack : an attack from
the point of view of nationalism, and an attack from the point of
view of those special interests of the middle and working classes
which were menaced by Capitalism. The one served to mature the
movement towards territorial exclusiveness, the other the growth
of special privileges for such employers and workmen as are not
equal to the stress of competition. Once Liberalism has been com­
pletely vanquished, however, and no longer menaces the protective
system, there remains nothing to oppose the extension of particular
privilege. It was long thought that territorial protection was
limited to national areas, that the re-imposition of internal tariffs,
limitation of internal migration, and so on, was no longer con­
ceivable. And this is certainly true so long as any regard at all is
preserved for Liberalism. But, during the war, even this was
abandoned in Germany and Austria, and there sprang up overnight
all kinds of regional barriers. In order to secure a lower cost of
living for their own population, the districts producing a surplus of
agricultural produce cut themselves off from the districts that could
support their population only by importing foodstuffs. The cities
and industrial areas limited immigration in order to counteract the
2 30

D E C EN T R A L I ZAT I ON
rise in the price of foodstuffs and rents. Regional particularism
broke up that unity of economic area on which national neo­
merchantilism had based all its plans.
Even granting that Socialism is at all practicable, the develop ­
ment of a unitary world socialism would encounter grave difficulties .
It is quite possible that the workers in particular districts, or parti­
cular concerns, or particular factories, would take the view that the
instruments of production which happened to lie within their area
were their own property, and that no outsider was entitled to profit
by them. In such a case World Socialism would split up into numer­
ous self-independent socialist communities - if, indeed, it did not
become completely syndicalized. For Syndicalism is nothing less
than the principle of decentralization consistently applied.

CHAPTER III
FOREIGN TRADE UNDER SOCIALISM

I

§
Autarky and Socialism

SOCIALIST community, which did not include the whole of man­
Akind, would have no reason to remain isolated from the rest of the
world. It is true, that it might be disquieting for the rulers of such a
state that foreign ideas would come over the frontiers with foreign
products. They might fear for the permanence of their system, if their
subjects were able to compare their position with that of foreigners
who were not citizens ofa socialist community. But these are political
considerations, and do not appiy if the foreign states are also
socialistic. Moreover, a statesman who is convinced of the desir­
ability of Socialism must expect that intercourse with foreigners will
make them also socialists :. he will not fear lest it undermine the
socialism of his own compatriots.
The theory of Free Trade shows how the closing of the frontiers of
a socialist community against the import of foreign commodities
would injure its inhabitants. Capital and labour would have to be
applied under relatively unfavourable conditions yielding a lower
product than otherwise would have been obtained. An extreme
example will make this clear. At the expense of an enormous outlay
of capital and labour a socialist Germany could grow coffee in
greenhouses. But it would obviously be more advantageous to pro­
cure it £i'om Brazil in exchange for products for whose production
conditions in Germany were more favourable. 1

§2
Foreign trade under Socialism
Such considerations indicate the principles on which a socialist
community would have to base its commercial policy. In so far as
1 It is superfluous to dispute with the autarky plans, which have been most zealously
argued by the naive litterateurs of the 'Tat' circle (Fried, Das Ende des Kapitalismus,
Jena 193 I). Autarky would probably depress the standard of life of the German people
incomparably more than could the Reparations burden multiplied a hundred-fold.
232

F O R E I GN INVESTM ENT
it aspired to let its actions be guided purely by economic considerations
it would have to aim at securing just what under complete freedom of
trade would be secured by the unrestricted play of economic forces.
The socialist community would limit its activities to the production
of those commodities it could produce under comparatively more
favourable conditions than existed abroad, and it would exploit each
single line of production only so far as this relative advantage
justified. It would procure all other commodities from abroad by
way of exchange.
This fundamental principle holds good whether or not trade
with abroad is carried out by recourse to a general medium of
exchange - by recourse to money - or not. In foreign trade, just
as in internal trade - there is no difference between them - no
rational production could proceed without money reckoning and the
formation of prices for the means of production. On this point, we
have nothing to add to what we have said already. But here we wish
to consider a socialist community, existing in a world not otherwise
socialistic. This community could estimate and compute in money
in exactly the same way as a state railway, or a city waterworks,
existing in a society otherwise based upon private ownership of the
means of production.

§3
Foreign investment
No one can regard what his neighbour does as a matter of mere
indifference. Everyone is interested in raising the productivity of
labour by the widest division of labour possible under given circum­
stances. I too am injured if some people maintain a state of economic
self-sufficiency: for, if they were to relax their isolation, the division
of labour could be made even more comprehensive. If the means of
production are in the hands of relatively inefficient agents, the
damage is universal.
Under Capitalism the profit-seeking of individual entrepreneurs
harmonizes the interests of the individual with those of the com­
munity. On the one hand, the entrepreneur is always seeking for
new markets, and underselling with cheaper and better wares the
dearer and inferior products of less rationally organized production.
233

FOREIGN TRADE UNDER S O C IALISM
On the other, he is always seeking cheaper and more productive
sources of raw materials and opening up more favourable sites for
production. This is the true nature of that expansive tendency of
Capitalism, which neo-marxian propaganda so completely misrepre­
sents as the 'Verwertungsstreben des Kapitals', and so amazingly
involves into an. explanation of modern Imperialism.
The old colonial policy of Europe was mercantilistic, militaristic,
and imperialistic. With the defeat of mercantilism by liberal ideas,
the character of colonial policy completely changed. Of the old
c.olonial powers, Spain, Portugal and France had lost the greater part
of their former possessions. England, who had become the greatest
of the colonial powers, managed her possessions according to the
principles offree trade theory. It was not cant for English free traders
to speak of England's vocation to elevate backward people to a state
of civilization. England has shown by acts that she has regarded her
position in India, in the Crown Colonies, and in the Protectorates,
as a general mandatory of European civilization. It is not hypocrisy
when English liberals speak of England's rule in the colonies as
being not less useful for the inhabitants and for the rest of the world
than it is for England. The mere fact that England preserved Free
Trade in India shows that she conceived her colonial policy in a
spirit quite different from that of the states who entered, or re-entered
the sphere of colonial policy in the last decades of the nineteenth
century - France, Germany, the United States, Japan, Belgium and
Italy. The wars waged by England during the era of Liberalism to
extend her colonial empire and to open up territories which refused
to admit foreign trade, laid the foundations of the modern world
economy. 1 To measure the true significance of these wars one has
only to imagine what would have happened if India and China and
their hinterland had remained closed to world commerce. Not only
each Chinese and each Hindu, but also each European and each

1 In judging the English policy for opening up China, people constantly put in the
foreground the fact that it was the opium trade which gave the direct, immediate
occasion for the outbreak of war complications. But in the wars which the English and
French waged against China between 1839 and 1 860 the stake was the general freedom
of trade and not only the freedom of the opium trade. That from the Free Trade point
of view no barriers ought to be put in the way even of the trade in poisons, and that
everyone shouid abstain by his own impulse from enjoyments harmfui to his organism,
is not so base and mean as socialist and anglophobe writers tend to represent. Rosa
Luxemburg (Die Akkumulation des Kapitals, Berlin 1913, p. 363 et seq.) reproaches the
English and French that it was no heroic act to defeat with European weapons the
Chinese, who were provided only with out of date arms. Ought the French and
English also to have taken the field only with ancient guns and spears?
2 34

American, would be considerably worse off. Were England to lose
India to-day, and were that great land, so richly endowed by nature,
to sink into anarchy, so that it no longer offered a market for inter­
national trade - or no longer offered so large a market - it would be
an economic catastrophe of the first order.
Liberalism aims to open all doors closed to trade. But it no way
desires to compel people to buy or to sell. Its antagonism is confined
to those governments which, by imposing prohibition and other
limitations on trade, exclude their subjects from the advantages of
taking part in world commerce, and thereby impair the standard of
life of all mankind. The Liberal policy has nothing in common with
Imperialism. On the contrary, it is designed to overthrow
Imperialism and expel it from the sphere of international trade.
A socialist community would have to do the same. It, too, would
not be able to allow areas lavishly endowed by nature to be per_

refrain from exchange. But here Socialism would encounter a
problem which can only be solved under Capitalism - the problem
of ownership of capital abroad.
Under Capitalism, as Free Traders would have it, frontiers
would be without significance. Trade would flow over them
unhindered. They would prohibit neither the movement of the
most suitable producers towards immobile means of production,
nor the investment of mobile means of production in the most
suitable places. Ownership of the means of production would be
independent of citizenship. Foreign investment would be as easy
as investment at home.
Under Socialism the situation would be different. It would be
impossible for a socialist community to possess means of production
lying outside its own borders. It could not invest capital abroad even
if it would yield a higher product there. A socialist Europe must
remain helpless, while a socialist India exploits its resources ineffi­
ciently, and thereby brings fewer goods to the world market than it
would otherwise have done. New supplies of capital must be utilized
under less favourable conditions in Europe, while in India, for want
of new capital, more favourable conditions of production are not fully
exploited. Thus independent socialist communities existing side by
side and exchanging commodities only, would achieve a nonsensical
position. Quite apart from other considerations the very fact of
2 35

F O R EI GN TRADE UNDER S O C IAL I S M
their independence would lead to a state of affairs under which

productivity would necessarily diminish.

These difficulties could not be overcome so long as independent

socialist communities existed side by side. They could only be
surmounted by the amalgamation of the separate communities into
a unitary socialist state comprehending the whole world.

SOCIALISM

§I
The Nature of Socialism

HE essence of Socialism is this : All the means of production are
T in the exclusive control of the organized community. This and

this alone is Socialism. All other definitions are misleading.
It is possible to believe that Socialism can only be brought about
under quite definite political and cultural conditions. Such a belief
however is no justification for confining the term to one particular
form of Socialism and withholding it from all other conceivable ways
of reaiizing the sociaiist ideal. :Marxian socialists have been very
zealous in commending their own particular brand of Socialism as
the only true Socialism and in insisting that all other socialist ideals
and methods of realizing Socialism have nothing to do with genuine
Socialism. Politically this attitude of the socialists has been extremely
astute. It would have greatly increased the difficulties of their
campaign if they had been prepared to admit that their ideal had
anything in common with the ideals advocated by the leaders of other
parties. They would never have rallied millions of discontented
Germans to their banners if they had openly admitted that their
aims were not fundamentally different from those of the governing
classes of the Prussian state. If a marxian had been asked before
October 1 9 1 7 in what way his Socialism differed from the Socialism
of other movements, especially from that of the Conservat;ves, he
would have replied that under Marxian Socialism, Democracy and
Socialism were indissolubly united, and moreover that Marxian
Socialism was a stateless Socialism because it intended to abolish the
State.
We have seen already how much these arguments are worth, and
as a matter of fact, since the victory of the Bolsheviks, they have
rapidly disappeared from the list of Marxian commonplaces. At
any rate the conceptions of democracy and statelessness which the
Marxians hold to-day are quite different from those which they held
previously .

239

PAR T I C ULAR FORMS OF S O C I A L I S M
But the Marxians might have answered the question another
way. They might have said that their Socialism was revolutionary,
as opposed to the reactionary and conservative Socialism of others.
Such an answer leads much sooner to a recognition of the difference
between Marxian social democracy and other socialist movements.
For to a Marxian, revolution does not merely signifY a forcible
alteration of the existing state of affairs, but, as befits his peculiar
fatalism, a process which brings mankind nearer the fulfilment of its
destiny. l For him the impending social revolution which will bring
about Socialism is the last step to eternal salvation. Revolutionaries
are those whom history has chosen to be the instruments for the
realization of its plan. The revolutionary spirit is the sacred fire
which has descended upon them and enables them to accomplish
this great work. In this sense the Marxian socialist regards it as the
most notable characteristic of his party that it is a revolutionary
party. In this sense he regards all other parties as a singie, uniform,
reactionary mass because they are opposed to his methods of achiev­
ing ultimate bliss.
It is obvious that all this has nothing to do with the sociological
concept of the socialist community. It is certainly a remarkable
thing that a group of persons should claim to be the only people
elected to bring us to salvation; but when these persons know of no
other road to salvation than one which many others have believed in,
the assertion that they exclusively are ordained for the task is not
sufficient to differentiate their aim fundamentally from that of others.

§2
State Socialism
To understand the concept of State Socialism it is not sufficient to
explain the term etymologically. The history of the word reflects
only the fact that State Socialism was the Socialism professed by the
authorities of the Prussian and other German states. Because they
identified themselves with the State and with the form taken by the
State and with the idea of the State generally, it suggested calling the
Socialism which they adopted State Socialism. The more Marxian

1 On the other meanings which the term Revolution has for the Marxists see
above, p. 81 et seq.

STATE SOCIALISM
teaching about the class character of the State and the decay of the
State obscured the fundamental idea of the State, the easier it became
to use the term.
Marxian Socialism was vitally concerned in making a distinction
between nationalization and socialization of the means of production.
The slogans of the social democratic party would never have become
popular if they had represented nationalization of the means of
production as the ultimate aim of socialist change. For the state
known to the people among whom Marxism found its widest
acceptance was not such as to inspire much hope from its incursions
into economic activity. The German, Austrian and Russian di:;ciples
of Marxism lived in open feud with the powers which to them
represented the State. In addition they had t�e opportunity of
gauging the results of nationalization and municipalization; and,
with the best will in the world, they could not overlook the great
shortcomings of state and municipal enterprise. It was quite
impossible to arouse enthusiasm for a programme aiming at national­
ization. A party of opposition was bound above all things to attack
the hated authoritarian state; only in this way could it win over the
discontented. From this need of political agitation arose the marxian
doctrine of the withering away of the state. The liberals had de­
manded the limitation of the authority of the state and the transfer
of government to the representatives of the people; they had
demanded the free state. Marx and Engels tried to outbid them by
unscrupulously adopting the anarchistic doctrine of the abolition of
all state authority regardless of the fact that Socialism would not
mean the abolition, but rather the unrestricted expansion of the
power of the state.
Equally untenable and absurd as the doctrine ef the withering
away of the state under Socialism is the academic distinction
between nationalization and socialization which is closely bound up
with it. The Marxians themselves are so conscious of the weakness of
their line of argument that they usually avoid discussing this point
and confine themselves to talking of the socialization of the means of
production, without any further elaboration of the idea, so as to
create the impression that socialization is something different from
the nationalization with which everybody is acquainted. When they
cannot avoid discussing this ticklish point they are obliged to admit
thatthe nationalization of undertakings is a 'preliminary stage in the
24 1

PART I CULAR F ORMS O F S O C IALISM
acquisition of all productive powers by society itself' l or 'the natural
jumping-off point in the process leading to the socialist community' S
Thus Engels finally contents himself with entering a caveat
against accepting without further ado 'every' form of nationalization
as socialistic. He would not in the first place describe as 'steps
towards Socialism', nationalization carried out for purposes of state
finance, such as might be adopted 'chiefly to provide new sources of
revenue independent of Parliamentary sanction' . Nevertheless for
these reasons nationalization would also mean, in the marxian
language, that in one branch of production, the appropriation of
'
surplus value by the capitalist was abolished. The same is true of
nationalization carried out for political or military reasons which
Engels also refused to accept as socialistic. He regards it as the cri­
terion of socialistic nationalization that the means of production
and trade taken over 'should have actually out-grown the direction
by joint stock companies, so that nationalization has become
economically inevitable'. This necessity arises first in the case of
'the large scale communications: posts, telegraphs and railways' .'
But it is precisely the largest railways in the world - the North
American - and the most important telegraphs lines - the deep sea
cables - that have not been nationalized, whilst small unimportant
lines in the etatistic countries have long been nationalized. The
nationalization of the postal service moreover was primarily for
political reasons and that of the railways for military ones. Can it
be said that these nationalizations were 'economically inevitable?'
And what on earth does 'economically inevitable' mean?
Kautsky, too, contents himself with rejecting the view 'that
every nationalization of an economic function or of an economic
enterprise is a step towards Socialism and that this can be brought
about by a general nationalization of the whole economic machine
without the need for a fundamental change in the nature of the
State' .' But no one has ever disputed that the fundamental nature
of the State would be greatly changed if it were transformed into a
socialist community through the nationalization of the whole
economic apparatus. Thus Kautsky is unable to say anything more
'
'
than that ' �s long as the possessing classes are the governing classes'
.

complete nationalization is impossible. It will be achieved when
'the workers become the governing classes in the state'. Only when
the proletariat has seized political power will it 'transform the state
into a great fundamentally self-sufficient economic society'. 1 The
main question - the question which alone needs an answer ­
whether complete nationalization carried out by another party than
the socialist one would also constitute Socialism, Kautsky carefully
avoids.
There is, of course, a fundamental distinction of the highest
importance between the nationalizati�n or municipalization of
individual undertakings which are publicly or communally run in a
society otherwise maintaining the principle of private property in the
means of production, and the complete socialization which tolerates
no private ownerships by individuals in the means of production
alongside that of the socialist community. "A..s long as only a few
undertakings are run by the State, prices for the means of production
will be established in the market, and it is thus still possible for State
undertakings to make calculations. How far the conduct of the
undertakings would be based on the results of these calculations is
another question; but the very fact that to a certain extent the results
of operations can be quantitatively ascertained provides the business
administration of such undertakings with a gauge which would not
be available to the administration of a purely socialist community.
The way in which State undertakings are run may justifiably be
called bad business but it is still business. In a socialist community,
as we have seen, economy in the strict sense of the word, cannot
exist.»
Nationalization of all the means of production involves complete
Socialism. Nationalization of some of the means of production is a
step towards complete Socialism. Whether we are to remain satisfied
with the first step or whether we desire to proceed further does not
alter its fundamental character. In the same way, if we wish to
transfer all undertakings to the ownership of the organized com­
munity we cannot do otherwise than nationalize every single under­
taking, simultaneously or successively.
The obscurity thrown by Marxism on the idea of socialization
was strikingly illustrated in Germany and Austria when the social1

democrats came into power in November 1 9 18. A new and hitherto
almost unheard slogan became popular overnight: Sucialization
(Sozialisierung) was the solution. This was merely the paraphrasing
of the German word Vergesellschaftung into a fine-sounding foreign
word. The idea that Sozialisierung was nothing more than
nationalization or municipalization could not occur to anybody;
anyone who maintained this was simply believed to know nothing
about it, since it was thought that between the two things yawned an
abysmal gap. The Socialization Commissions set up soon after the
social-democrats acquired power were set the problem of defining
Sozialisierung in such a way that, ostensibly at least, it could be
distinguished from the nationalization and municipalization of the
previous regime.
The first report issued by the German commission dealt with the
socialization of the coal industry, and in rejecting the idea of achiev­
ing this by the nationalization of the coal mines and the coal trade
it emphasized in a striking manner the shortcomings of a national
coal industry. But nothing was said as to how socialization differed
actually from nationalization. The report professed the opinion
that 'an isolated nationalization of the coal industry cannot be
considered as socialization while capitalist enterprise continues in
other branches of production: it would only mean the replacement
of one employer by another' . But it left open the question whether
an isolated 'socialization' such as it intended and proposed could
mean anything else under the same conditions. 1 It would have been
understandable if the commission had gone on to say that in order to
fulfil the happy results of a socialist order of society it was not
sufficient to nationalize one branch of production, and had recom­
mended that the State should take over all undertakings at one
blow, as the Bolsheviks in Russia and Hungary had done and as the
Spartacists in Germany wanted to do. But it did not do this. On
the contrary, it elaborated proposals for socialization which
advocated the isolated nationalization of various branches of pro­
duction, beginning with coal production and distribution. That the
commission avoided using the term nationalization makes no
difference. It was mere juristic hair-splitting when the commission

proposed that the owners of the socialized German coal industry
should not be the German State but a 'German public coal trust'
and when it went on to assert that this ownership should be con­
ceived 'only in a formal juristic sense', but that 'the material position
of the private employer and thereby the possibility of exploiting
workers and consumers' is denied to this public trust, 1 the commission
was using the emptiest of gutter catchwords. Indeed the whole
report is nothing but a collection of all the popular fallacies about the
evils of the capitalist system. The only way in which the coal
industry, socialized in accordance with the proposals of the majority,
would differ from other public undertakings is the composition of its
directorate. At the head of the coal mines there should be no single
official but a committee constituted in a certain way. Parturiunt

State Socialism, therefore, is not distinguished by the fact that
the State is the pivot of the communal organization, since Socialism
is quite inconceivable otherwise. If we wish to understand its nature
we must not look to the term itself. This would take us no further
than would an attempt to grasp the concept of metaphysics from an
examination of the meaning of the parts that make up the word. We
must ask ourselves what ideas have been associated with the expression
by those who are generally regarded as the followers of the state
socialistic movements, that is, the out-and-out etatists.
Etatistic Socialism is distinguished from other socialist systems in
two ways. In contradistinction to many other socialist movements
which contemplate the greatest possible measure of equality in the
distribution of the social income between individuals, Etatistic
Socialism makes the basis of distribution the merit and rank of the
individual. It is obviously superfluous to point out that judgment of
merit is purely subjective and cannot in any way be tested from a
scientific view of human relations. Etatism has quite definite views
about the ethical value of individual classes in the community. It is
imbued with a high esteem for the monarchy, the nobility, big land­
owners, the clergy, professional soldiers, especially the officer class,
and officials. With certain reservations it also allots a privileged
position to savants and to artists. Peasants and small tradesmen are
in a special class and below them come the manual labourers. At

the bottom are the unreliable elements which are discontented with
the sphere of action and the income allotted to them by the etatist
plan and strive to improve their material position. The etatist
mentally arranges a hierarchy of the members composing his future
state. The more noble will have more power, more honours and
more income than the less noble. What is noble and what is ignoble
will be decided above all by tradition. To the etatist the worst
feature of the capitalist system is that it does not assign income
according to his valuation of merit. That a milk dealer or a manu­
facturer of trouser buttons should draw a larger income than the
sprig of a noble family, than a privy councillor or a lieutenant,
strikes him as intolerable. In order to remedy this state of affairs the
capitalist system must be replaced by the etatistic.
This attempt on the part of the etatists to maintain the traditional
social order of rank and the ethical valuation of different classes, in
no way contemplates transferring ail property in the means of
production to the formal ownership of the State. This indeed, in the
etatistic view, would be a complete subversion of all historical rights.
Only the large undertakings would be nationalized, and even then
an exception would be made in favour of large scale agriculture,
especially inherited family property. In agriculture and in small and
medium-sized industries private property is to continue in name at
least. In the same way the free professions will be allowed scope, with
certain limitations. But all enterprises must become essentially state
undertakings. The agriculturist will retain the name and title of
owner, but he will be forbidden 'egoistically to look merely to
mercantile profit' ; he has the 'duty to execute the aims of the State'. 1
For agriculture, according to the etatist, is a public office. 'The
agriculturist is a state official and must cultivate for the needs of the
State according to his best knowledge and conscience, or according
to state orders. If he gets his interest and sufficient to maintain
himself he has everything he is entitled to demand.' 2 The same
applies to the artisan and the trader. For the independent entre­
preneur with free control over the means of production there is as

STATE SOCIALISM
little room in State Socialism as in any other Socialism. The
authorities control prices and decide what and how much shall be
produced and in what way. There will be no speculation for
'excessive' profit. Officials will see to it that no one draws more than
the appropriate 'fair income', that is to say an income ensuring him a
standard of life appropriate to his rank. Any excess will be 'taxed
away'.
Marxian writers are also of the opinion that to bring Socialism
about, small undertakings need not necessarily be transferred directly
to public ownership. Indeed they have regarded this as quite
impossible; the only way in which socialization can be carried out
for these small undertakings is to leave them in the formal possession
of their owners and simply subject them to the all-embracing super­
vision of the State. Kautsky himself says that 'no socialist worthy of
serious consideration has ever demanded that peasants should be
expropriated, let alone their property confiscated;. 1 Neither does
Kautsky propose to socialize small producers by expropriating their
property, 2 The peasant and the craftsman will be fitted into the
machinery of the socialist community in such a way that their pro­
duction and the valuation of their products will be regulated by the
economic administration whilst nominally the property will remain
theirs. The abolition of the free market will transform them from
independent owners and entrepreneurs into functionaries of the
socialist community, distinguished from other citizens only by the
form of the remuneration.' It cannot therefore be regarded as a
peculiarity of the etatistic socialist scheme that in this way remnants
of private property in the means of production formally persist.
The only characteristic peculiarity is the extent to which this method
of arranging the social conditions of production is applied. It has
already been said that etatism in general proposes in the same way to
leave the large landowners - with the exception perhaps of the
latifundia owners - in formal possession of their property. What is
still more important is that it proceeds upon the assumption that
the greater part of the population will find work in agriculture and
small concerns, and that comparatively few will enter the direct
service of the State as employees in large undertakings. Not only is

etatism opposed to orthodox Marxists, as represented by Kautsky,

through its theory that small scale agriculture is not less productive

than large scale agriculture, but it is also of the opinion that in
industry too, small scale undertakings have a great scope for opera­
tion at the side of the large concerns. This is the second peculiarity
which distinguishes State Socialism from other socialist systems,
especially social-democracy.

It is perhaps unnecessary further to elaborate the picture of the
ideal State drawn by the state socialists. Over a large part of Europe
it has been for decades the tacit ideal of millions, and everyone knows

it even if no one has clearly defined it. It is the Socialism of the
peaceful loyal civil servant, of the land-owner, the peasant, the small
producer and of countless workers and employees. It is the Socialism
of the professors, the famous 'socialists of the chair' - the Katheder

Sozialismus

-

it is the Socialism of artists, poets, writers in an epoch

of the history of art plainly bearing all the signs of decay. It is the
Socialism supported by the churches of all denominations. It is the
Socialism of Caesarism and of Imperialism, the ideal of the so-called
'social monarchy' . It is this that the policy of most European states,

especially the German states, envisaged as the distant goal of man's
endeavours. It is the social ideal of the age which prepared the
Great War and perished with it.
A Socialism which allots the shares of individuals in the social

dividend according to merit and rank can be conceived only in the
form of State Socialism. The hierarchy on which it bases its distribu­

tion is the only one popular enough not to arouse overwhelming
opposition. Although it is less able to withstand rationalist criticism
than many others that might be suggested, nevertheless it has the
sanction of age. In so far as State Socialism attempts to perpetuate
this hierarchy and to prevent any change in the scale of social

relationships, the description 'conservative socialism', sometimes
applied to it, is justified. 1 In fact it is imbued more than any other
form of Socialism with ideas that credit the possibility of complete
crystallization and changelessness of economic conditions : its

followers regard every economic innovation as- superfluous and even

harmful. And corresponding to this attitude is the method by which
Etatism wishes to attain its ends. If Marxian Socialism is the social

ideal of those who expect nothing except through a radical subversion
of the existing order by bloody revolutions, State Socialism is the
ideal of those who call in the police at the slightest sign of trouble.
Marxism relies upon the infallible judgment of a proletariat filled
with the revolutionary spirit, Etatism upon the infallibility of the
reigning authority. They both agree in beliefin a political absolutism
which does not admit the possibility of error.
In contrast to State Socialism, Municipal Socialism presents no
special form of the socialist ideal. The municipalization of under­
takings is not regarded as a general principle on which to base a
new arrangement of economic life. It would affect only undertakings
with a market limited in space. In a rigorous system of State
Socialism the municipal undertakings would be subordinated to the
chief economic administration and would be no freer to develop
than the agricultural and industrial undertakings nominally
remaining in private hands.

§3
Military Socialism
Military Socialism is the Socialism of a state in which all institu­
tions are designed for the prosecution of war. It is a State Socialism
in which the scale of values for determining social status and the
income of citizens is based exclusively or preferably on the position
held in the fighting forces. The higher the military rank the greater
the social value and the claim on the national dividend.
The military state, that is the state of the fighting man in which
everything is subordinated to war purposes, cannot admit private
ownership in the means of production. Standing preparedness for
war is impossible ii aims other than war influence the life of
individuals. All warrior castes whose members have been supported
by the assignment of manorial rights or of grants of land, or even by
industries based on a supply of unfree labour, have in time lost their
warlike nature. The feudal lord became absorbed in economic
activity and acquired other interests than waging war and reaping
military honours. All over the world the feudal system demilitarized
the warrior. The knights were succeeded by thejunkers. Ownership
turns the fighting man into the economic man. Only the exclusion
of private property can maintain the military character of the State.

249

PAR T I C U L A R F O R M S O F S O C I A L I S M
Only the warrior who has no other occupation apart from war than
preparation for war, is always ready for war. Men occupied in
affairs may wage wars of defence but not long wars of conquest.
The military state is a state of bandits. It prefers to live on booty
and tribute. Compared with this source of income the product of
economic activity plays only a subordinate role ; often it is completely
lacking. And if booty and tribute accrue from abroad it is clear that
they cannot go direct to individuals but only to the common
treasury, which can distribute them only according to military rank.
The army which alone assures the continuance of this source of
income would not tolerate any other method of distribution. And
this suggests that the same principle of distribution should be applied
to the products of home production, which similarly accrue to
citizens as the tribute and yield of serfdom.
In this way the communism of the Hellenic pirates of Lipara and
all other robber states can be explained . 1 It is the 'communism of
robbers and freebooters', S arising from the application of military
ideas to all social relationships. Caesar relates of the Suebi, whom he
calls gens longe bellicosissima Germanorum omnium, that they sent
warriors over the borders every year for plunder. Those who
remained behind carried on economic activity for those in the field;
in the following year the roles were exchanged. There was no land
in the exclusive ownership of individuals.8 Only by each sharing in
the product of the military and economic activity carried on with a
common purpose and subject to a common danger, can the warrior
state make every citizen a soldier and every soldier a citizen . Once
it allows some to remain soldiers and others to remain citizens
working with their own property the two callings will soon stand out
in contrast. Either the warriors must subjugate the citizens and in
that case it would be doubtful if they could set out on plundering
expeditions leaving an oppressed population at home - or the
citizens will succeed in gaining the upper hand. In the latter event
the warriors will be reduced to mercenaries and forbidden to set out
in search of plunder because, as a standing danger, they cannot be
allowed to grow too powerful. In either case the state must lose its

purely military character. Therefore any weakening of 'communistic'
institutions involves a weakening of the military nature of the state,
and the warrior society is slowly transformed into an industrial one. l
The forces driving a military state to Socialism could be clearly
observed in the Great War. The longer the war lasted and the more
the states of Europe were transformed into armed camps, the more
politically untenable seemed the distinction beween the fighting man,
who had to endure the hardships and danger of the war, and the man
who remained at home to profit from the war boom. The burden
was distributed too unequally. If the distinction had been allowed
to persist and the war had continued longer the countries would
infallibly have been split into two factions and the armies would have
finally turned their weapons against their own kinsmen. The
Socialism of conscript armies demands for its complement the
Socialism of conscript labour at home.
The fact that they cannot preserve their military character with­
out a communistic organization does not strengthen the warrior states
in the war. Communism is for them an evil which they must
accept ; it produces a weakness by which they eventually perish.
Germany in the first years of the war trod the path to Socialism
because the military etatistic spirit, which was responsible for
the policy leading to the war, drove it towards State Socialism.
Towards the end of the war socialization was more and more ener­
getically carried out because, for the reasons just stated, it was
necessary to make conditions at home similar to those at the front.
State Socialism did not alleviate the situation in Germany, however,
but worsened it; it did not stimulate production but restricted it; it
did not improve the provisioning of the army and those at home but
made it worse" And needless to say it was the fault of the etatistic
spirit that in the tremendous convulsions of the war and the subse­
quent revolution not one strong individual arose from the German
people.
The lesser productivity of communistic methods of economic
activity is a disadvantage to the communistic warrior state when it
comes into clash with the richer and therefore better armed and
provisioned members of nations which acknowledge the principle of

private property. The destruction of initiative in the individual,
unavoidable under Socialism, deprives it in the decisive hour of
battle of leaders who can show the way to victory, and subordinates
who can carry out their instructions. The great military communist
state of the Incas 1 was easily overthrown by a handful of Spaniards.
If the enemy against which the warrior state has to fight is to be
found at home then we can speak of a communism of overlords.
'Casino communism' was the name given by Max Weber to the
social arrangements of the Dorians in Sparta because of their habits
of eating together. 2 If the ruling caste, instead of adopting com­
munistic institutions assigns land together with its inhabitan� to the
ownership of individuals sooner or later it will be ethnically absorbed
by the conquered. It becomes tranformed into a land-owning
nobility, which eventually draws even the conquered into military
service. In this way the state loses the character based upon the
waging of war. Thi� development took place in the kingdonis of the
Langobards, the West Goths and the Franks and in all the regions
where the Normans appeared as conquerors.

Christian Socialism
A theocratic organization of the state demands either a self­
sufficing family economy or the socialist organization of industry. It
is incompatible with an economic order which allows the individual
free play to develop his powers. Simple faith and economic rational­
ism cannot dwell together. It is unthinkable that priests should
govern entrepreneurs.
Christian Socialism, as it has taken root in the last few decades
among countless followers of all Christian churches, is merely a
variety of State Socialism. State Socialism and Christian Socialism are
so entangled that it is difficult to draw any clear line between them, or
to say of individual socialists whether they belong to the one or the

other. Even more than etatism, Christian Socialism is governed by
the idea that the economic system would be perfectly stationary if the
desire for profit and personal gain by men directing their efforts
solely to the satisfaction of material interests did not disturb its
smooth course. The advantage of progressive improvements in
methods of production is admitted, if only with limitations; but the
Christian socialist does not clearly understand that it is just these
innovations which disturb the peaceful course of the economic
system. In so far as this is recognized, the existing state of affairs is
preferred to any further progress. Agriculture and handicraft, with
perhaps small shopkeeping, are the only admissible occupations. Trade
and speculation are superfluous, injurious, and evil. Factories and
large scale industries are a wicked invention of the 'Jewish spirit'; they
produce only bad goods which are foisted on buyers by the large
stores and by other monstrosities of modern trade to the detriment of
purchasers. It is the duty of legislation to suppress these eXCesSeS of
the business spirit and to restore to handicraft the place in produc­
tion from which it has been displaced by the machinations of big
capital. 1 Large transport undertakings that cannot be abolished
should be nationalized.
The basic idea of Christian Socialism that runs through all the
teachings of its representatives is purely stationary in outlook. In
the economic system which they have in mind there is no entre­
preneur, no speculation, and no 'inordinate' profit. The prices and
wages demanded and given are 1ust'. Everyone is satisfied with his
lot because dissatisfaction would signify rebellion against divine and
human laws. For those incapable of work Christian charity will
provide. This ideal it is asserted was achieved in medieval times.
Only unbelief could have driven mankind out of this paradise. If it
is to be regained mankind must first find the way back to the Church.
Enlightenment and liberal thought have created all the evil which
afflicts the world to-day.
The protagonists of Christian social reform as a rule do not
regard their ideal Society of Christian Socialism as in any way
socialistic. But this is simply self-deception. Christian Socialism
appears to be conservative because it desires to maintain the existing

order of property, or more properly it appears reactionary because it
wishes to restore and then maintain an order of property that pre..
vailed in the past. It is also true that it combats with great energy the
plans ofsocialists of other persuasions for a radical abolition of private
property, and in contradistinction to them asserts that not Socialism
but social reform is its aim. But Conservatism can only be achieved
by Socialism. Where private property in the means of production
exists not only in name but in fact, income cannot be distributed
according to an historically determined or an any other way per­
manently established order. Where private property exists, only
market prices can determine the formation of income. To the degree
in which this is realized, the Christian social reformer is step by step
driven to Socialism, which for him can be only State Socialism. He
must see that otherwise there cannot be that complete adherence to
the traditional state of affairs which his ideal demands. He sees that
fixed prices and wages cannot be maintained, unless deviations from
them are menaced by threats of punishment from a supreme
authority. He must also realize that wages and prices cannot be
arbitrarily determined according to the ideas of a world improver,
because every deviation from market prices destroys the equilibrium
of economic life. He must therefore progressively move from a
demand for price regulation to a demand for a supreme control over
production and distribution. It is the same path that practical
etatism has followed. At the end in both cases, is a rigid Socialism
which leaves private property only in name, and in fact transfers all
control over the means of production to the State.
Only a part of the Christian socialist movement has openly sub­
scribed to this radical programme. The others have shunned an open
declaration. They have anxiously avoided drawing the logical
conclusions of their premises. They give one to understand that they
are combating only the excrescences and abuses of the capitalist
order; they protest that they have not the slightest desire to abolish
private property; and they constantly emphasize their opposition to
Marxian Socialism. But they characteristically perceive that this
opposition mainly consists in differences of opinion as to the way in
which the best state of society can be attained. They are not revolu­
tionary and expect everything from an increasing realization that
reform is necessary. For the rest they constantly proclaim that they
do not wish to attack private property. But what they would retain
254

CHRISTIAN SO CIAL I S M
is only the name of private property. If the control of private
property is transferred to the State the property owner is only an
official, a deputy of the economic administration.
I t can be seen at once how the Christian Socialism of to-day
corresponds to the economic ideal of the medieval Scholastics. The
starting point, the demand for �ust' wages and prices, that is, for a
definite historically attained distribution of income, is common to
both. Only the realization that this is impossible if the economic
system retains private property in the means of production, forces the
modern Christian reform movement towards Socialism. In order to
achieve their demands, they must advocate measures which, even if
formally retaining private property, lead to the complete socializa­
tion of society.
It will be shown later that this modern Christian Socialism has
nothing to do with the suppositious but often cited Communism of the
Early Christians. The socialist idea is new to the Church. This is not
altered by the fact that the most recent development of Christian
social theory has led the Church 1 to recognize the fundamental
rightfulness of private property in the means of production, whereas
the early Church teaching, in view of the command of the gospels
condemning all economic activity, had avoided unconditionally
accepting even the name of private property. For we must under­
stand what the Church has done in recognizing the rightfulness of
private property, only as opposition to the efforts of the socialists to
overthrow the existing order forcibly. In reality the Church desires
nothing but State Socialism of a particular colour.
The nature of socialistic methods of production is independent
of the concrete methods involved in the attempt to realize it. Every
attempt at Socialism, however brought about, must founder on the
impracticability of setting up a purely socialistic economy. For that
reason, and not because of deficiencies in the moral character of
mankind, Socialism must fail.
1 In the above text we have always spoken only of the Church in general, without
considering the differences between the various denominations. This is quite admis­
sible. The evolution towards Socialism is common to all denominations. In
Catholicism. Leo XIII's encvclical. 'Rerum Novarum'. of 1 80- 1 . has recolffi
- ized the
origin of private property in Natural Law; but simultaneously the Church laid down
a series of fundamental ethical principles for the distribution of incomes, which could
be put into practice only under State Socialism. On this basis stands also Pius Xl 's
encyclical, 'Quadragesimo anno' of 1 93 1 . In German Protestantism the Christian
Socialist idea is so tied up with State Socialism that the two can hardly be dis­
tinguished.

It may be granted, that the moral qualities required of the
members of a socialist community could best be fostered by the
Church. The spirit which must prevail in a socialist community is
most akin to that of a religious community. But to overcome the
difficulties in the way of establishing a socialist community would
require a change in human nature or in the laws of the nature by
which we are surrounded, and even faith cannot bring this to pass.

§5
The planned economy

The so-called planned economy (Planwirtschafl) is a more recent
variety of Socialism.
Every attempt to realize Socialism comes up Quickly allainst
insurmo�mtable . difficulties. This is what happen�d to ' P�ssian
State Socialism. The failure of nationalization was so striking that it
could not be overlooked. Conditions in government undertakings
were not such as to encourage further steps along the road to state
and municipal control. The blame for this was thrown upon the
officials. It had been a mistake to exclude the 'business man'. In
some way or other the abilities of the entrepreneur must be brought
to the service of Socialism. From this notion came the arrangement of
'mixed' enterprise. Instead of complete nationalization or munici­
palization we have the private undertaking in which the state or
municipality is interested. In this way, on the one side, regard is
paid to the demand of those who think it is not right that the state
and municipalities should not share in the yield of undertakings
carried on under their august sway. (Of course the State might get
and gets its share more effectively by taxation without exposing the
public finances to the possibility of loss.) On the other hand it is
thought by this system to bring all the active powers of the entre­
preneur into the service of the common enterprise - a gross error.
For as soon as representatives of the government take part in adminis­
tration all the hindrances which cripple the initiative of public
officials come into play. The 'mixed' form of undertaking makes it
possible to exempt emp10yees and workers from the regulations
applying to public officials and thereby to mitigate slightly the
harmful effects which the official spirit exerts upon the profitability
2 56

THE PLANNED E C ON O MY

of undertakings. The mixed undertakings have certainly turned out
better on the whole than the purely governmental undertakings. But
this no more shows that Socialism is practicable than do the good
results occasionally shown by individual public undertakings. That
it is possible under certain favourable circumstances to carry on a
public enterprise with some success in the midst of an economic society
otherwise based on private property in the means of production
does not prove that a complete socialization of society is practicable.
During the Great War the authorities in Germany and Austria
tried, under war Socialism, to leave to the entrepreneurs the direction
of nationalized undertakings. The haste with which socialist
measures were adopted under very difficult war conditions and the
fact that at the outset no one had any clear idea of the fundamental
implications of the new policy, nor of the lengths to which it was to
be carried, left no other means open. The direction of individual
branches of production was made over to compuisory associations
of employers, who were put under government supervision. Price
regulation on the one hand and drastic taxation of profits on the other
hand were to ensure that the employer was no more than an
employee sharing the yield. 1 The system worked very badly.
Nevertheless it was necessary to adhere to it, unless all attempts at
Socialism were to be abandoned, because no one knew anything
better to put in its place. The memorandum of the German
Economic Ministry (May 7th, 19 19) , drawn up by Wissell and
Moellendorff, states in plain words, that there was nothing else for a
socialist government to do but to maintain the system known during
the war as 'war economy'. 'A socialist government' it says 'cannot
ignore the fact that, because of a few abuses, public opinion is being
poisoned by interested criticisms against a systematic planned
economy; it may improve the planned system; it may reorganize
the old bureaucracy; it may even in the form of self-government
make over the responsibility to the people concerned in the business;
but it must proclaim itself an adherent of the compulsory planned
economy: that is to say an adherent of the most unpopular concepts
of duty and coercion."
Planned economy is a scheme of a socialist community that

attempts to solve in a particular way the insoluble problem of the
responsibility of the acting organ. Not only is the idea on which this
attempt is based deficient, but the solution itself is only a sham, and
that the creators and supporters of this scheme should overlook this,
is particularly characteristic of the mental attitude of officialdom.
The self-government granted to individual areas and to individual
branches of production is important only in minor matters, for the
centre of gravity of economic activity lies in the adjustment between
individual areas and individual branches of production. This
adjustment can only proceed uniformly; if this is not provided for,
the whole plan would have to be regarded as syndicalist. In fact
Wissel and Moellendorff envisage a State Economic Council which
has 'supreme control of the German economic system in co-operation
with the highest competent organs of the State.' 1 In essence, there­
fore, the whole proposal comes to nothing more than that responsi­
bility for the economic administration is to be shared between the
ministers and a second authority.
The Socialism of the planned economy is distinguished from the
State Socialism of the Prussian State under the Hohenzollerns
chiefly by the fact that the privileged position in business control and
in the distribution of income, which the latter allotted to the Junkers
and the bureaucrats, is here assigned to the ci-devant entrepreneur.
This is an innovation dictated by the change in the political situation
resulting from the catastrophe which has overwhelmed the Crown,
the nobility, the bureaucracy and the officer class; apart from this
it is without significance for the problem of Socialism.
In the last few years, a new word has been found for that which
was covered by the expression 'planned economy' : State Capitalism, and
no doubt in the future many more proposals for the salvaging of
Socialism will be brought forward. We shall learn many new names
for the same old thing. But the thing, not its names, is what matters,
and all schemes of this sort will not alter the nature of Socialism.
§6
Guild Socialism
In the first years after the World War, people in England and on
the Continent looked on Guild Socialism as the panacea. It has long

since been forgotten.

Nevertheless, we must not pass it over in

silence, when discussing socialist projects; for it represents the one

contribution to modern socialist plans made by the Anglo-Saxons,
in economic matters the most advanced of peoples. Guild Socialism

is another attempt to surmount the insoluble problem of a socialist
direction of industry. It did not need the failure of state socialistic
activities to open the eyes of the English people, preserved by the
long reign of liberal ideas from that over-valuation of the State which
has been prevalent in modern Germany. Socialism in England has

never been able to overcome the mistrust of the government's
capacity to regulate all human affairs for the best. The English have
always recognized the great problem which other Europeans before
191 4 had scarcely grasped.
In Guild Socialism three different things must be distinguished.

It establishes the necessity for replacing the capitalist system by a
socialist one; this thoroughly eclectic theory need not worry us

further. It also provides a way by which Socialism may be realized ;
this is only important for us inasmuch as it could very easily lead to
Syndicalism instead of Socialism. Finally it draws up the programme
ofa future socialist order ofsociety. It is with this that we are concerned.

The aim of Guild Socialism is the socialization of the means of
production. We are therefore justified in calling it socialism. Its
unique feature is the particular structure which it gives to the
administrative organization of the future socialist state. Production

ductions. They elect foremen, managers and other business leaders,

and they regulate directly and indirectly the conditions oflabour and
order the methods and aims of production. 1 The Guilds as organiza-

1 'Guildsmen are opposed to private ownership of industry, and strongly in favour of
public ownership. Of course, this does not mean that they desire to see industry
bureaucratically administered by State departments. They aim at the control of
industry by National Guilds including the whole personnel of the industry. But they
do not desire the ownership of any industry by the workers employed in it. Their
aim is to establish industrial democracy by placing the administration in the hands of
the workers, but at the same time to eliminate profit by placing the ownership in the
hands of the public. Thus the workers in a Guild will not be working for profit: the
prices of their commodities and, indirectly at least, the level of their remuneration will
be subject to a considerabie measure of public control. The Guild system is one of
industrial partnership between the workers and the public, and is thereby sharply
distinguished from the proposals described as "Syndicalist" . . . The governing idea
of National Guilds is that of industrial self-government and democracy. Guildsmen
hold that democratic principles are fully as applicable to industry as to politics. '

tions of the producers in the individual branches of industry, face the
State as the organization of the consumers. The State has the right
to tax the Guilds, and is thus able to regulate their price - and
wages-policy. 1
Guild Socialism greatly deceives itself if it believes that in this
way it could create a socialist order of society which would not
endanger the freedom of the individual and would avoid all those
evils of centralized Socialism which the English detest as Prussian­
ism.' Even in a guild socialist society the whole control of production
belongs to the State. The State alone sets the aim of production
and determines what must be done in order to achieve this aim.
Directly or indirectly through its taxation policy, it determines the
conditions of labour, moves capital and labour from one branch of
industry to another, makes adjustments and acts as intermediary
between the guilds themselves and between producers and consumers.
These tasks falling to the State are the only important ones and they
constitute the essence of economic control. What is left to the
individual guilds, and, inside them, to the local unions and individual
concerns is the execution of work assigned to them by the State. The
whole system is an attempt to translate the political constitution of
the English State into the sphere of production; its model is the
relation in which local governments stands to central government.
Guild Socialism expressly describes itself as economic Federalism.
But in the political constitution of a liberal state it is not difficult to
concede a certain independence to local government. The necessary
co-ordination of the parts within the whole is sufficiently ensured by
the compulsion enforced on every territorial unit to manage its
affairs in accordance with the laws. But in the case of production

much bread is to be made; it is one thing to build houses, another to decide where the
houses are to be built. This list of opposites can be lengthened indefinitely, and no
amount of democratic fervour will destroy them. Faced with these facts, the Guild
Socialist says that there is need for iocai and centrai authorities whose business it shaii
be to watch over that important part of life that lies outside production. A builder
may think it advisable to be for ever building, but the same man lives in some locality
and has a right to say whether this purely industrial point of view shall have absolutely

this is far from sufficient. Society cannot leave it to the workers
themselves in individual branches of production to determine the
amount and the quality of the labour they perform and how the
material means of production thereby involved shall be applied. 1
If the workers of a guild work less zealously or use the means of
production wastefully, this is a matter which concerns not only them
but the whole society. The State entrusted with the direction of
production cannot therefore refrain from occupying itself with the
internal affairs of the guild. If it is not allowed to exercise direct
control by appointing managers and works directors, then in some
other way - perhaps by the means which lie at hand in the right of
taxation, or the influence it has over the distribution of consumption
goods - it must endeavour to reduce the independence of the guilds
to a meaningless fac;:ade. It is the foremen who are in daily and
hourly contact with the individual worker to direct and supervise his
work who are hated most by the worker. Social reformers, who take
over naively the sentiments of the workers, may believe it possible to
replace these organs of control by trustworthy men chosen by the
workers themselves. This is not quite as absurd as the belief of the
anarchists that everyone would be prepared without compulsion to
observe the rules indispensable for communal life; but it is not much
better. Social production is a unity in which every part must perform
exactly its function in the framework of the whole. It cannot be left
to the discretion of the part to determine how it will accommodate
itself to the general scheme. If the freely chosen foreman does not
display the same zeal and energy in his supervisory work as one not
chosen by the workers, the productivity of labour will fall.
Guild Socialism therefore does not abolish any of the difficulties
in the way of establishing a socialist order of society. It makes
Socialism more acceptable to the English spirit by replacing the
word nationalization, which sounds disagreeable in English ears, by
1 Tawney (The Acquisitive Society, London 192 1 , p. I Z2) considers that the advan­
tage of the Guild System for the worker is that it puts an end to 'the odious and degrad­
ing system under which he is thrown aside like unused material whenever his services
do not happen to be required'. But just this reveals the gravest defect of the system
rec.onunended. If one needs no more building because relatively su..fficient buildings
exist, yet must build so as to occupy the workers in the building trades who are un­
willing to change over to other branches of production that suffer from a comparative
scarcity of labour, the position is uneconomic and wasteful. The very fact that Capital­
ism forces men to change their occupations is its advantage from the standpoint of
the General Best, even though it may directly disadvantage the special interests of small
groups.

the catchword 'Self-Government in Industry' . But in essence it does
not offer anything different from what continental socialists recom­
mend to-day, namely, the proposal to leave the direction of produc­
tion to committees of the workers and employees engaged in pro­
duction, and of consumers. We have already seen that this brings us
no nearer to solving the problem of Socialism.
Guild Socialism owes much of its popularity to the syndicalistic
elements which many of its adherents believe are to be found in it.
Guild Socialism as its literary representatives conceive it, is doubtless
not syndicalistic. But the way in which it proposes to attain its end
might very easily lead to Syndicalism. If, to begin with, national
guilds were established in certain importan� branches of production
which would have to work in an otherwise capitalist system, this
would mean the syndicalization of individual branches of industry.
As everywhere else, so here too, what appears to be the road to
Socialism can in fact easily prove to be really the path to Syndicalism.

CHAPTER II
P S E U D O - S O C IALIST

SYSTEMS

§I
Solidarism

N recent decades few have managed to remain uninfluenced by the
I success of the socialist criticism of the capitalist social order. Even

those who did not want to capitulate to Socialism, have tried in
many ways to act according to its criticism of private ownership in
the means of production. Thus they have originated systems, ill­

thought-out, eClectic in theory and weak in politics, which attempted
to reconcile the contradictions. They were soon forgotten. Only one
of these systems has spread - the system which calls itself Solidarism.
This is at home above all in France; it has been called, not unjustly,

the official social philosophy of the Third Republic. Outside of
France, the term 'Solidarism' is less well known, but the theories

which make Solidarism are everywhere the social-political creed of
all those religiously or conservatively inclined who have not joined
Christian or State Socialism. Solidarism is distinguished neither
by the depth of its theory, nor the number of its adherents. That
which gives it a certain importance is its influence on many of the

best and finest men and women of our times.
Solidarism starts by saying that the interests of all members of
society harmonize. Private ownership in the means of production is
a social institution the maintenance of which is to the interest of all,
not merely of the owners; everyone would be harmed were it replaced

by a common ownership endangering the productivity of social
labour. So far, Solidarism goes hand in hand with Liberalism. Then,
however, their ways separate. For solidarist theory believes that the
principle of social solidarity is not realized simply by a social order
based on private ownership in the means of production. It denies ­

without, however, arguing this more closely or bringing to light ideas
not put forward before by the socialists, especially the non-marxists
- that merely acting for one's own property-interests within a legal
263

PSEUDO-SOCIALIST SYSTEMS

order guaranteeing liberty and property ensures an interaction of
the individual economic actions corresponding to the ends of social
co-operation. Men in society, by the very nature of social co­
operation, within which alone they can exist, are reciprocally
interested in the well-being of their fellow men; their interests are
'solidary,' and they ought therefore to act with 'solidarity'. But mere
private ownership in the means of production has not achieved
solidarity in the society dividing labour. To do so special, provisions
must be made. The more etatistically inclined wing of Solidarism
wants to bring about 'solidary' action by State action: laws shall
impose obligations on the possessors in favour of the poorer people
and in favour of the public welfare. The more ecclesiastically
inclined wing of Solidarism wants to achieve the same thing by
appeals to the conscience; not by State laws, but by moral prescrip­
tions: Christian love will make the individual fulfil his social
duties.
The representatives of Solidarism have laid down their social­
philosophic views in brilliantly written essays, which reveal all the
splendour of the French spirit. No one has been better able to paint in
beautiful words the mutual dependence of men in society. At the
head of them all is Sully Prudhomme. In his famous sonnet he
shows the poet on awaking from a bad dream in which he has seen
himself, as division of labour has ceased and no one will work for
him, seul, abandonne de tout le genre humain. This leads him to the
knowledge:
' . . . qu'au siecle OU nous sommes
Nul ne peut se vanter de se passer des hommes;
Et depuis ce jour-la, je les ai tous aimes,'
They have also known well how to state their case firmly, either by
theological ' or juristic arguments. But all this must not blind us to
the inner weakness of the theory. Solidarist theory is a foggy eclecti­
cism. It demands no special discussion. It interests us here
1 Here one must name before all the Jesuit Pesch (Lehrbuch der Nationallikonomie,
I

Vol. I, :md Edition, Freiburg 1914, pp. 392-438). In France there is a conflict between
catholic and freethinking solidarists - about the relation of the Church to the State
and to society, rather than about the real. principles of social theory and policy ­
which makes Church circles suspicious of the term 'solidarism'. See Haussonville,

S O L IDARISM

much less than its social ideal, which claims 'to avoid the faults of
the individualist and socialist systems, to maintain that which is
right in both'. 1
Solidarism proposes to leave the private ownership in the means
of production. But it places above the owner an authority - indif­
ferent whether Law and its creator, the State, or conscience and its
counsellor, the Church - which is to see that the owner uses his
property correctly. The authority shall prevent the individual from
exploiting 'unrestrainedly' his position in the economic process;
certain restrictions are to be imposed on property. Thus State or
Church, law or conscience, become the decisive factor in society.
Property is put under their norms, it ceases to be the basic and ulti­
mate element in the social order. It continues to exist only as far as
Law or Ethics allow, that is to say, ownership is abolished, since the
owner, in administering his property, must follow principles other
than those imposed on him by his property interests. To say that,
under all circumstances, the owner is bound to follow the prescrip­
tion of Law and Ethics, and that no legal order recognizes ownership
except within limits drawn by the norms, is by no means a reply. For
if these norms aim only at free ownership and to prevent the owner
from being disturbed in his right to keep his property as long as it
does not pass to others on the basis of contracts he has made, then
these norms contain merely recognition of private ownership in the
means of production. Solidarism, however, does not regard these
norms as alone sufficient to bring together fruitfully the labour of
members of society. Solidarism wants to put other norms above them.
These other norms thus become society's fundamental law. No longer
private property but legal and moral prescription of a special kind,
are society's fundamental law. Solidarism replaces ownership by
a 'Higher Law' ; in other words, it abolishes it.
Of course, the solidarists do not really want to go as far. They
want, they say, only to limit property, but to maintain it in principle.
But when one has gone so far as to set up for property limits other
than those resulting from its own nature, one has already abolished

not be allowed to lead to 'the decay of the middle-class' or to the
'oppression of the weak'. 1 This merely means that a given condition
of social production is to be preserved, even though it would vanish
under private property. The owner is told what and how and how
much he shall produce and at what conditions and to whom he shall
sell. He thus ceases to be owner; he becomes a privileged member of
a planned economy, an official drawing a special income.
Who shall decide in every single case, how far Law or Ethics go
in limiting the owner's rights? Only the Law or Ethics itself.
Were Solidarism itself clear about the consequences of its postu­
lates, it would certainly have to be called a variety of Socialism. But
it is far from clear. It believes itself fundamentally different from
State Socialism, ' and the majority of its supporters would be
horrified, were they to recognize what their ideal really was. There­
fore its social ideal may still be counted one of the pseudo-socialist
systems. But it must be realized that what separates it from Socialism
is one single step. Only the mental atmosphere of France, generally
more favourable to Liberalism and Capitalism, has prevented the
French Solidarists and the Jesuit Pesch, an economist under French
influence, from overstepping decisively the boundary between
Solidarism and Socialism. Many, however, who still call themselves
solidarists, must be counted complete etatists. Charles Gide, for
example, is one of these.

Various proposals Jor expropriation

Precapitalist mov ements for the reform of property generally
culminate in the demand for equality in wealth. All shall be equally
rich; no one shall possess more or less than the others. This equality
is to be achieved by redividing the land and to be made lasting by
prohibiting sale or mortgage of land. Clearly, this is not Socialism,
though it is sometimes called agrarian-Socialism.

PROPOSALS FOR EXPROPRIATION

All such proposals therefore, which aim only to expropriate the means
of production are not to be regarded as Socialism; at best, they can
be only proposals for a way to Socialism.
If, for example, they proposed a maximum amount to which one
and the same person may own private property, they could be
regarded as Socialism only if they intend to make the wealth thus
accruing to the State the basis of socialist production. We should
then have before us a proposal for socialization. It is not difficult to
see that this proposal is not expedient. Whether the amount of the
means of production which could thus be socialized is a greater or
smaller one will depend on the extent to which private fortunes are
still permitted. If this is fixed low, the proposed system is little
different from immediate socialization. If it is fixed high, the action
against private property will not do much to socialize the means of
production. But anyway a whole series of unintended consequences
must occur. For just the most energetic and active entrepreneurs
will be prematurely excluded from economic activity, whilst those
rich men whose fortunes approach the limit will be tempted to
extravagant ways of living. The limitation of individual fortunes
may be expected to slow down the formation of capital.
Similar considerations apply to proposals, which one hears in
various quarters, to abolish the right of inheritance. To abolish
inheritance and the right to make donations intended to circumvent

the prohibition, would not bring about complete Socialism, though
it would, in a generation, transfer to society a considerable part of
all means of production. But it would, above all, slow down the
formation of new capital, and a part of the existing capital would be
consumed.

§3
Profit-sharing
One school of well-meaning writers and entrepreneurs recom­
mends profit-sharing with wage earners. Profits shall no longer
accrue �xclusively to-the entrepreneur; they shall be divided between
the entrepreneurs and the workers. A share in the profits of the
undertakings shall supplement the wages of the workers. Engel
expects from this no less than 'a settlement, satisfYing both parties, of
267

PSEUDO-SOCIALIST SYSTEMS

the raging fight, and thus, too, a solution of the social question.' 1
Most protagonists of the profit-sharing system attach no less import­
ance to it.
The proposals to transfer to the worker a part of the entrepreneur's
profits proceed from the idea that, under Capitalism, the entre­
preneur deprives the worker of a part of that which he could really
claim. The basis for the idea is the obscure concept of an inalienable
right to the 'full' product of labour, the exploitation theory in its
popular, most naive, form, here expressed more or less openly. To
its advocates the social question appears as a fight for the entre­
preneur's profit. The socialists want to give this to the workers; the
entrepreneurs Claim it for themselves. S'Jmebody comes along and
recommends that the fight be ended by a compromise: each party
shall have part of his claim. Both will thus fare well : the entre­
preneurs, because their claim is obviously unjust, the workers because
they get, without fighting, a considerable increase of income. This
train of thought, which treats the problem of the social organization
oflabour as a problem of rights, and tries to settle a historical dispute
as if it were a quarrel between two tradesmen, by splitting the
difference, is so wrong that there is no purpose in going into it more
closely. Either private ownership in the means of production is a
necessary institution of human society or it is not. If it is not, one
can or must abolish it, and there is no reason to stop half-way out of
regard for the entrepreneur's personal interests. If, however, private
property is necessary, it needs no other justification for existing, and
there is no reason why, by partially abolishing it, its social effective­
ness should be weakened.
The friends of profit-sharing think it would spur the worker on to
a more zealous fulfilment of his duties than can be expected from a
worker not interested in the yield of the undertaking. Here too, they
err. Where the efficiency of labour has not been diminished by all
kinds of socialist destructionist sabotage, where the worker can be
dismissed without difficulty and his wages adjusted to his achieve­
ments without regard to collective agreements, no other spur is
necessary to make him industrious. There, in such conditions, the

Jahrg., 1 867, pp. 1 29-1 54). A survey of the German literature on profit sharing is

PROF IT-SHARING

worker works fully conscious of the fact that his wages depend on
what he does. But where these factors are lacking, the prospect of
getting a fraction of the net profit of the undertaking would not
induce him to do more than just as much as is formally necessary.
Though of a different order of magnitude, it is the same problem we
have already considered in examining the inducements in a socialist
community to overcome the disutility of labour. Of the product of
the extra labour, the burden of which the worker alone has to carry,
he receives a fraction not sufficiently large to reward the extra
effort.
If the workers' profit-sharing is carried out individually, so that
each worker participates in the profits of just that undertaking he
happens to be working for, there are created without any evident
reason, differences in income which fulfil no economic function,
appear to be utterly unjustified, and which all must feel unjust.
'It is inadmissible that the turner in one works should earn twenty
marks and receive ten marks more as a share of profits, while a turner
in a competing works, where business is worse, perhaps worse
directed, gets only twenty marks. This means either that a 'rent' is
created and perhaps that jobs connected with this 'rent' are sold or
that the worker tells his entrepreneur: 'I don't care from what fund
you pay the thirty marks; if my colleague receives it from the compe­
tition I demand it too.' Individual profit-sharing must lead straight
to Syndicalism, even if it is a Syndicalism where the entrepreneur still
keeps part of the entrepreneur's profit.
However, another way could be tried. Not the individual workers
participate in the profits, but all the citizens; a part of the profits of
all undertakings is distributed to all without distinction. This is
already realized in taxation. Long before the war, joint stock
companies in Austria had to surrender to the State and to other
tax-levying authorities from twenty to forty per cent of their net
profits; in the first years of the peace this grew from sixty to ninety
per cent and more. The 'mixed' public enterprise is the attempt to
find a form for the community's participation, which makes the
community share the management of the concern, in return for
which it has to share in the providing of capital. Here, too, there is
no reason why one should be content with half abolishing private

property, if society could abolish the institution completely without
injuring the productivity of labour. If, however, to abolish private
property is disadvantageous, then the half abolition is disad­
vantageous too. The half-measure may, in fact, be hardly less
destructive than the clean sweep. Advocates usually say that the
'mixed' undertaking leaves scope for the entrepreneur. However, as
we have already shown, state or municipal activity hampers the
freedom of the entrepreneur's decisions. An undertaking forced to
collaborate with civil servants is not able to utilize the means of
production in such ways as profit making demands. 1

Syndicalism
As political tactics Syndicalism presents a particular method of
attack by organized labour for the attainment of their political ends.
This end may also be the establishment of the true Socialism, that is
to say, the socialization of the means of production. But the term
Syndicalism is also used in a second sense, in which it means a socio­
political aim of a special kind. In that sense Syndicalism is to be
understood as a movement whose object is to bring about a state of
society in which the workers are the owners of the means of produc­
tion. We are concerned here with Syndicalism only as an aim; with
Syndicalism as a movement, as political tactics, we need not deal.
Syndicalism as an aim and Syndicalism as political tactics do
not always go hand in hand. Many groups which have adopted the
syndicalist 'direct action' as the basis of their proceedings are striving
for a genuinely socialist community. On the other hand the attempt
to realize Syndicalism as an end can be carried on by methods other
than those of violence recommended by Sore!'

In the minds of the great bulk of workers who call themselves

socialists or communists, Syndicalism presents itself, at least as
vividly as Socialism, as the aim of the great revolution. The 'petty
bourgeois' ideas which Marx thought to overcome are very wide­
spread - even in the ranks of the marxian socialists. The great mass
desire not the genuine Socialism, that is, centralized Socialism but
Syndicalism. The worker wishes to be the lord of the means of

SYND ICALISM

production which are employed in his particular undertaking. The
social movement round about us shows more clearly every day that
this and nothing else is what the worker desires. In contradistinction
to Socialism which is the result of armchair study, syndicalist ideas
spring direct from the mind of the ordinary man, who is always hostile
to 'unearned' income obtained by someone else. Syndicalism like
Socialism aims at the abolition of the separation of worker from the
means of production, only it proceeds by another method. Not all
the workers will become the owners of all the means of production;
those in a particular industry or undertaking or the workers engaged
in a complete branch of production will obtain the means of pro­
duction employed in it. The railways to the railway men, the mines
to the miners, the factories to the factory hands - this is the slogan.
We must ignore every freak scheme for enacting Syndicalist ideas
and take a thoroughly consistent application of the main principle to
the whole economic order as the starting point of our examination.
This is not difficult. Every measure which takes the ownership of
all the means of production from the entrepreneurs, capitalists, and
landlords without transferring it to the whole of the citizens of the
economic area, is to be regarded as Syndicalism. It makes no
difference in this case, whether in such a society more or less of these
associations are formed. It is unimportant whether all branches of
production are constituted as separate bodies or only single under­
takings, just as they happen to have evolved historically, or single
factories or even single workshops. In essence the scheme is hardly
affected if the lines drawn through the society are more or less,
horizontal or vertical. The only decisive point is that the citizen of
such a community is the owner of a share of certain means of pro­
duction and the non-owner of other means of production, and that in
some cases, for example, when he is unable to work, he may own no
property at all. The question whether the workers' incomes will, or
will not, be noticeably increased, is unimportant here. Most workers
have absolutely fantastic ideas about the increase of wealth they
could expect under syndicalist arrangements of property. They
believe that just the mere distribution of the share which landlords,
capitalists and entrepreneurs draw under capitalist industry must
considerably increase the income of each of them. Apart from this
they expect an important increase in the product of industry, because
they, who regard themselves as particularly expert, will themselves
27 1

PSEUDO-SOCIALIST SYSTEMS
conduct the enterprise, and because every worker will be personally
interested in the prosperity of the undertaking. The worker will no
longer work for a stranger but for himself. The liberal thinks quite
differently about all this. He points out that the distribution of rent
and profit incomes among the workers would bring them an insig­
nificant increase in incomes. Above all he maintains that enterprises
which are no longer directed by the self-interest of entrepreneurs
working on their own account but by labour leaders unfitted for the
task will yield less, so that the workers will not only earn no more
than under a free economy, but considerably less.
If syndicalist reform merely handed over to the workers the
ownership of the means of production and left the system of property
of the capitalist order otherwise unchanged, the result would be no
more than a primitive redistribution of wealth. The redistribution
of goods with the obiect of restoring the equality of property and
we;lth is at the back of the mind of the ordfnary man whenever he
thinks of reforming social conditions, and it forms the basis for all
popular proposals for socialization. This is not incomprehensible in
the case of land workers, to whom the object of all ambition is to
acquire a homestead and a piece of land large enough to support him
and his family; in the village, redistribution, the popular solution of
the social problem, is quite conceivable. In industry, in mining, in
communications, in trade and in banking where a physical redistribu­
tion of the means of production is quite inconceivable, we get instead
a desire for the division of the property rights while preserving the
unity of the industry or enterprise. To divide in this simple way
would be, at best, a method of abolishing for the moment the
inequality in the distribution of income and poverty. But after a
short time, some would have squandered their shares, and others
would have enriched themselves by acquiring the shares of the less
economically efficient. Consequently there would have to be constant
redistributions, which would simply serve to reward frivolity and
waste - in short every form of uneconomic behaviour. There will be
no stimulus to economy if the industrious and thrifty are constantly
compelled to hand over the fruits of their industry and thrift to the
lazy and extravagant.
Yet even this result - the temporary achievement of equality of
income and property - could not be accomplished by syndicaliza­
tion. For syndicalization is by no means the same for all workers.
2 72

SYNDICALISM

The value of the means of production in different branches of pro­
duction is not proportional to the number of workers employed. It is
unnecessary to elaborate the fact that there are products which
involve more of the productive factor, labour, and less of the pro­
ductive factor, Nature. Even a division of the means of production
at the historical commencement of all human production would have
led to inequality; much more so if these means are syndicalized at a
highly progressive stage of capital accumulation in which not only
natural factors of production but produced means of production
are divided. The values of the shares falling to individual workers in
a redistribution of this kind would be very different: some would
obtain more, others less, and as a result some would draw a larger
income from property - unearned income - than others. Syndi­
calization is in no way a means of achieving equality of incomes. It
abolishes the existing inequality of incomes and property and
repiaces it by another. It may be that this syndicalistic inequality is
regarded as more just than that of the capitalistic order - but on
this point science can give no judgment.
If syndicalist reform is to mean more than the mere redistribution
of productive goods, then it cannot allow the property arrangements
of Capitalism to persist in regard to the means of production. It
must withdraw productive goods from the market. Individual
citizens must not dispose of the shares in the means of production
which are allotted to them; for under Syndicalism these are bound
up with the person of the owner in a much closer way than is the
case in the liberal society. How, in different circumstances, they
may be separated from the person can be regulated in various
ways.
The naive logic of the advocates of Syndicalism assumes without
any further ado a completely stationary condition of society, and
pays no attention to the problem, how the system will adapt itself to
changes of economic conditions. If we assume that no changes occur
in the methods of production, in the relations of supply and demand,
in technique, or in population, then everything seems to be quite in
order. Each worker has only one child, and departs out of this world
at the moment his successor and sole heir becomes capable of work;
the son promptly steps into his place. We can perhaps assume that
a change of occupation, a transfer from one branch of production to
another or from one independent undertaking to another by a
2 73

PSEUDO-SOCIALIST SYSTEMS

voluntary simultaneous exchange of positions and of shares in the
means of production will be permitted. But for the rest the syndicalist
state of society necessarily assumes a strictly imposed caste system
and the complete end of all changes in industry and, therefore, in
life. The mere death of a childless citizen disturbs it and opens
up problems which are quite insoluble within the logic of the
system.
In the syndicalist society the income of a citizen is made up of the
yield from his portion of property and of the wages from his labour;
If the shares in the property in the means of production can be
freely inherited, then in a very short time differences in property
holding will arise even if no changes occur among the living. Even
if at the beginning of the syndicalist era the separation of the worker
from the means of production is overcome, so that every citizen is an
entrepreneur as well as a worker in his undertaking, it may so happen
that later on citizens who do not belong to a particular undertaking
inherit shares in it This would very quickly drive the syndicalist
society to a separation oflabour and property, without the advantages
of the capitalist order of society. 1
Every economic change immediately creates problems on which
Syndicalism would inevitably be wrecked. If changes in the direc­
tion and extent of demand or in the technique of production cause
changes in the organization of the industry, which require the transfer
of workers from one concern to another or from one branch of pro­
duction to another, the question immediately arises what is to be
done with the shares of these workers in the means of production.
Should the workers and their heirs keep the shares in those industries
.

to which they happened to belong at the actual time of syndicaliza­

tion and enter the new industries as simple workers earning wages,
without being allowed to draw any part of the property income? Or
should they lose their share on leaving an industry and in return
receive a share per head equal to that possessed by the workers
already occupied in the new industry? Either solution would quickly
violate the principle of Syndicalism. If, in addition, men were per­
mitted to dispose of their shares. conditions would gradually return
to the state prevailing before the reform. But if the worker on his
departure from an industry loses his share and on entering another

done in Nation, Staat und Wirtschaft, p. 164.

2 74

PAR T I A L S O C I AL I S M
industry acquires a share in that, those workers who stood to lose by
the change would, naturally, oppose energetically every change in
production. The introduction of a process making for greater pro­
ductivity of labour would be resisted ifit displaced workers or might
displace them. On the other hand the workers in an undertaking or
branch of industry would oppose any development by the introduc­
tion of new workers if it threatened to reduce their income from
property. In short, Syndicalism would make every change in pro­
duction practically iinpossible. Where it existed there could be no
question of economic progress.
As an aim Syndicalism is so absurd, that speaking generally, it
has not found any advocates who dared to write openly and clearly
in its favour. Those who have dealt with it under the name of co­
partnership have never thought out its problems. Syndicalism
has never been anything else than the ideal of plundering
hordes.

Partial Socialism
Natural ownership of the means of production is divisible. In
capitalist society, it generally is divided. 1 But the power to dispose
which belongs to him who directs production and which alone we call
ownership, is indivisible and illimitable. It may belong to several
people jointly, but cannot be divided in the sense that the power of
disposing itself can be decomposed into separate rights of command.
The power to dispose of the use of a commodity in production can
only be unitary; that this could in any way be dissolved into elements
is unthinkable. Ownership in the natural sense cannot be limited ;
wherever one speaks of limitation, one means either a curtailment of
a too-widely drawn juristic definition or recognition of the fact that
ownership in the natural sense belongs concretely to someone other
than the person whom the iaw recognizes as owner.
All attempts to abolish by a compromise the contrast between
common property and private ownership in the means of production
1 See above. p. 40 et seq.
2 75

PS E U D O - S O C I A L I S T S YS T E MS

are therefore mistaken. Ownership is always where the power to
dispose resides. 1 Therefore State Socialism and planned economies,
which want to maintain private property in name and in law, but
in fact, because they subordinate the power of disposing to State
orders, want to socialize property, are socialist systems in the full
sense. Private property exists only where the individual can deal
with his private ownership in the means of production in the way he
considers most advantageous. That in doing so he serves other
members of society, because in the society based on division of labour
everyone is the servant of all and all the masters of each, in no way
alters the fact that he himself looks for the way in which he can best
perform this service.
It is not possible to compromise, either, by putting part of the
means of production at the disposal of society and leaving the re­
mainder to individuals. Such systems simply stand unconnected, side
by side, and operate fully only within the space they occupy. Such
mixture of the social principles of organization must be considered
senseless by everyone. No one can believe that the principle which he
holds to be right should not be carried through to the end. Nor can
anyone assert that one or the other of the systems proves the better
only for certain groups of the means of production. Where people
seem to be asserting this, they are really asserting that we must
demand the one system at least for a group of the means ofproduction
or that it should be given at most for a group. Compromise is always
only a momentary lull in the fight between the two principles, not the
result of a logical thinking-out of the problem. Regarded from the
stand-point of each side, half-measures are a temporary halt on the
way to complete success.
The best known and most respected of the systems of compromise
believes indeed that it can recommend half-measures as a permanent
institution. The land-reformers want to socialize the natural factors
of production, but for the rest to leave private ownership in the means
of production. They hereby proceed from the assumption, regarded
as self-evident, that common property in the means of production
gives a higher yield than private property. Because they regard land
as the most important means of production, they wish to transfer it
to society. With the breakdown of the thesis that public ownership

2 76

PARTIAL SOCIALISM
could achieve better results than private ownership, the idea of land
reform also falls to the ground. Whoever regards land as the most
important means of production must certainly advocate the private
ownership of land, if he considers private ownership the superior
economic form.

CH ILIASM

The origin of chiliasm

OCIALISM derives its strength from two different sources. On the one
S hand it is an ethical, political, and economico-political challenge.
The socialist order of society, fulfilling the claims of higher morality,
is to replace the 'immoral' capitalist economy; the 'economic rule'
of the few over the many is to give way to a co-operative order which
alone can make true democracy possible; planned economy, the only
rational system working according to uniform principles, is to sweep
away the irrational private economic order, the anarchical produc­
tion for profit. Socialism thus appears as a goal towards which we
ought to strive because it is morally and rationally desirable. The
task therefore of men of good will is to defeat the resistance to it which
is inspired by misunderstanding and prejudice. This is the basic
idea of that Socialism which Marx and his school call Utopian.
On the other hand, however, Socialism is made to appear as the
inevitable goal and end of historical evolution. An obscure force
from which we cannot escape leads humanity step by step to higher
planes of social and moral being. History is a progressive process of
purification, with perfection, in the form of Socialism, at the end.
This train of thought does not run counter to the ideas of Utopian
Socialism. Rather it includes them, for it presupposes, as obviously
self-evident, that the socialist condition would be better, nobler, and
more beautiful than the non-socialist. But it goes farther; it sees the
change to Socialism - envisioned as progress, an evolution to a higher
stage - as something independent of human will. A necessity of
Nature, Socialism is the inevitable outcome of the forces underlying
social life: this is the fundamental idea of evolutionary socialism,
which, in its Marxist form, has taken the proud name of 'Scientific'
Socialism.
In recent times scholars have been at pains to prove that the
main notions of the materialist or economic conception of history
281

SOCIALISTIC CHILIASM
had been set forth by pre-marxian writers, among them some of those
whom Marx and his supporters contemptuously call Utopians.
These researches and the critique of the materialist conception of
history which accompany them, however, tend to set the problem in
much too narrow a perspective. They concentrate on the peculi­
arities of the Marxist theory of evolution, its specifically economic
nature, and the importance it gives to the class war, and they forget
that it is also a doctrine of perfection, a theory of progress and
evolution.
The materialist conception of history contains three eleme�ts,
which, though they combine to form a closed system, have each a
special significance for the marxian theory. First, it involves a
special method of historical and sociological research. As such it
tries to explain the relation between the economic structure and the
whole life of a period. Secondly, it is a sociological theory, since it
sets up a definite concept of class and class war as a sociological
element. Finally, it is a theory of progress, a doctrine of the destiny
of the human race, of the meaning and nature, purpose and aim of
human life. This aspect of the materialist conception of history has
been less noticed than the other two, yet this alone concerns socialist
theory as such. Merely as a method of research, an heuristic principle
for the cognition of social evolution, the materialist conception of
history is obviously in no position to talk about the inevitability of a
socialistic order of society. The conclusion that our evolution is
tending towards Socialism does not of necessity follow from the study
of economic history. The same is true of the theory of the class-war.
Once the view has been adopted that the history of all previous
society is the history of class struggles, it becomes difficult to see why
the struggle of classes should suddenly disappear. Might it not be
supposed that what had always been the substance of history will
continue to be so to the very end? Only as a theory of progress can
the materialist conception of history concern itself with the final goal
of historical evolution and assert that the decay of Capitalism and
the victory of the proletariat are alike inevitable. Nothing has helped
the spread of socialist ideas more than this belief that Socialism is
inevitable. Even the opponents of Socialism are for the most part
bewitched by it: it takes the heart out of their resistance. The
educated person is afraid of appearing unmodern if he does not show
that he is actuated by the 'social' spirit, for already the age of

282

ORIGIN OF CHILIASM
Socialism, the historic day of the Fourth Estate, is supposed to have
dawned and everyone who still clings to Liberalism is in conse­
quence a reactionary.

Every triumph of the socialist idea which

brings us nearer to the socialist way of production is counted as
progress; every measure which protects private property is a set­
back. The one side looks on with sadness or an even deeper emotion,
the other with delight, as the age of private property passes with the
changing times, but all are convinced that history has destined it to
irrevocable destruction.
Now as a theory of progress, going beyond experier�ce and what
can be experienced, the materialist conception of history is not
science but metaphysics. The essence of all metaphysics of evolution
and history is the doctrine of the beginning and end, the origin and
purpose ofthings. This is conceived either cosmically, embracing tAe
whole universe, or it is anthropocentric and considers man alone.
It can be religious or philosophic. The anthropocentnc metaphysical
theories of evolution are known as the philosophy of history. The
theories of evolution which are of a religious character must always
be anthropocentric, for the high significance religion attaches to
mankind can be justified only by an anthropocentric doctrine. These
theories are based generally on the assumption of a paradisiac origin,
a Golden Age, from which man is moving farther and farther away,
only to return finally to an equally good, or, if possible, even better,
age of perfection. This generally includes the idea of Salvation. The
return of the Golden Age will save men from the ills which have
befallen them in an age of evil. Thus the whole doctrine is a message
of earthly salvation. It must not be confused with that supreme
refinement of the religious idea of Salvation developed in those
doctrines which transfer salvation from Man's earthly life into a
better world Beyond. According to these doctrines the earthly life
of the individual is never the final end. It is merely preparation for a
different, better and painless existence which may even be found in
a state of non-existence, in dissolution in the All, or in Destruction.
For our civilization the message of salvation of the Jewish
prophets came to have a special importance. The Jewish Prophets
promise no salvation in a better world beyond, they proclaim a King­
dom of God on Earth. 'Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that
the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes
him that soweth the seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine,
283

SOCIALISTIC CHILIASM

and all the hills shall melt.' 1 'The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the
young lion and the fading together; and a little child shall lead them.
And the cow and the bear shall feed, their young ones shall lie down

together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the suckling
child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put
his hand on the cockatrice's den. They shall not hurt or destroy in
all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea'.' Only when such a message
of salvation is promised for the immediate future will it be joyfully
accepted. And in fact Isaiah says that only 'yet a little while'
separates men from the promised hour.' But the longer they have to
wait the more impatient must the faithful become. What good to
them is a Kingdom of Redemption which they will not live to enjoy!
The nromise of salvation therefore. must necessarilv exnand into a
doctrine of the Resurrection of the Dead, a R�ur;ection that
brings every individual before the Lord, to be judged good or evil.
Judaism is full of these ideas at the time when Jesus appears
among his people as the Messiah. He comes not only to proclaim an
imminent salvation but also, in fulfilment of the prophecy, as the
bringer of the Kingdom of God.' He walks among the people and
preaches, but the world goes its way as of old. He dies on the cross,
but everything remains at it was. At first this shakes the faith of the
disciples profoundly. For the time being they go all to pieces and the
first little congregation scatters. Only belief in the Resurrection of
Christ crucified reinspires them, fiijing them with fresh enthusiasm
and giving them the strength to win new adherents to their doctrine
of salvation.' The message of salvation they preach is the same that
was preached by Christ: the Lord is near and with him the great
Day ofJudgment, when the world shall be renewed and the Kingdom
of God founded in place of the Kingdoms of the world. But as
expectation of an imminent Return of Christ vanished and the
growing congregations began to settle down to a longer period of
waiting, the belief in salvation had also to undergo a change. No
lasting world-religion could have been built up on the belief that the

ORIGIN OF CHILIASM

Kingdom of God was imminent. Each day that left the prophecy
unfulfilled would have impaired the Church's prestige. The funda­
mental idea of primitive Christianity that the Kingdom of God was
at hand had to be transformed into the Christian cult: into the belief
that the heavenly presence of their risen Lord entered into the
congregation, and into belief in the salvation of the sinful world by
Him. Only thus could the Christian Religious Community be
founded. From the moment of this transformation Christian
doctrine ceases to expect a Kingdom of God on, Earth. The idea of
salvation is sublimated into the doctrine that by baptism the faithful
become part of the Body of Christ. 'Already in Apostolic times the
Kingdom of God becomes merged in the Church, and all that is
left for the Coming ofthe Kingdom is the glorification of the Church,
the shattering of the earthly vessel, and the liberation of the shining
treasure from its mortal frame. For the rest, the Kingdom of God is
replaced by the eschatology ef Heaven, Hell and Purgatory,
Immortality and the Beyond - a contrast to the Gospels which is of
the highest significance. But even this end recedes, until at last the
Millennium came to mean the Church.' 1
There was, however, another way of meeting the difficulties
which arose when fulfilment of the promise had been postponed
longer than was originally expected. The faithful could take refuge
in the belief which had once sustained the Prophets. According to
this doctrine an earthly Kingdom of Salvation lasting one thousand
years would be set up. Condemned by the Church as heresy, this
doctrine of the Visible Return of Christ is continually revived not
only as a religious and political belief, but above all as an idea of social
and economic revolution.
From Christian Chiliasm, which runs through the centuries
constantly renewing its strength, a single step leads to the philosophic
Chiliasm which in the eighteenth century was the rationalist re­
interpretation of Christianity; and thence, through Saint Simon,
Hegel, and Weitling to Marx and Lenin.' Curiously enough, it is
this particular Socialism, derived in this way from mystical ideas
whose origin is lost in the darkness of history, which has called itself
scientific Socialism, while it has tried to disqualify as 'Utopian' the

Socialism that is derived from the rational considerations of the
philosophers.
The philosophical anthropocentric metaphysics of evolution
resembles the religious in every essential. In its prophecy of salva­
tion is found the same strange mixture of ecstatically extravagant
phantasy with uninspired commonplace and coarse materialism
as is found in the most ancient messianic prophecies. Like Christian
literature which seeks to interpret the apocalypse, it tries to prove
itself applicable to life by interpreting concrete historical events. In
these attempts it often makes itself ridiculous, rushing in on every
great occasion with a doctrine which both meets the case and
embraces the history of the universe. How many of these philosophies
of history arose during the World War!

§2
Chiliasm and social theory
The metaphysical philosophy of history must be clearly distin­
guished from the rational. The latter is built up solely on experience,
seeking results which are based on logic and empiricism. Wherever
rational philosophy has to go beyond this, it tries hypotheses, but it
never forgets where experience ceases and hypothetical interpreta­
tions begin. Where experience is possible it avoids using conceptual
fictions; it never tries to supplant experimental science. Its only
aim is to unify our view of social events and of the course of historical
evolution. Only thus is it able to establish a law which governs
changes in social conditions. By indicating, or attempting to indicate,
the force which determines the growth of society, it endeavours to
reveal the principle determining social evolution. This principle is
assumed to be eternally valid, that is, it is active so long as there is
any society at all. Were it otherwise, a second principle would have
to be placed next to this one, and it would be necessary to show under
which conditions the first ruled and under which the second. But
this only means that the law governing the interchange of the two
principies wouid be the uitimate Law of Social Life.
To define a principle according to which society grows, and
changes in social conditions take place, is a different thing from
defining the course which social evolution takes. Such a course is

286

CHILIASM AND SOCIAL THEORY

necessarily limited. It has a beginning and an end. The reign of a
law is necessarily unlimited, without beginning or end. It is con­
tinuity, not an occurrence. The law is imperfect if it defines only a
part of social evolution and leaves us in the lurch after a certain
point. In this case it would cease to be a law. The end of social
evolution can be no other than that of society itself.
The teleological view describes the course of evolution in all its
windings and deviations. Thus it is typically a theory of stages. It
shows us the successive stages of civilization until one is reached
which must necessarily be the last, because no other follows it. When
this point has been reached it is impossible to see how history is to
proceed. 1
The chiliastic philosophy of history takes the 'standpoint of
Providence, which lies beyond all human wisdom' ; it aims at
prophesying as only 'the eye of a God' could prophesy.' Whether
we call its teaching Poetry, Prophecy, Faith, Hope or anything else
whatever, there are two things it can never be: Science or Knowledge.
Nor may it be called hypothesis, any more than the utterances of a
clairvoyant or a fortune-teller may be called hypotheses. It was an
unusually clever trick on the part of the Marxists to call their
chiliastic teachings science. Such a step was bound to be effective in
an age when people relied on nothing but science, and rejected
metaphysics (though, admittedly, only to surrender themselves
uncritically to the naive metaphysics of BUchner and Moleschott) .
The law of social evolution tells us much less than the meta­
physics ofevolution. It limits its statements a priori in admitting that its
sway can be frustrated by the co-existence offorces other than those it
1 Wundt, Ethik, 4th Edition, Stuttgart, Vo!. 11, p. 246. One sees in Engels' survey of
the history of warfare a characteristic example of how ready the representatives of this
movement are to see the end of all evolution attained . Engels there - 1 878 - expresses
the opinion that, with the Franco-German war, 'a turning point of quite other import­
ance than all previous ones had occurred' in the history of warfare. 'Weapons are so
perfected that a fresh process of any revolutionary influence is no longer possible.
When one has guns which can hit a battalion as far as the eye can see and rifles which
can do the same with a single person as aim, with which loading takes less time than
firing, then all further advances are more or less indifferent in field war. Thus the era
of evolution on this side is essentially closed. ' (Herrn Eugen Diihrings Umwalzung tier
Wissenschajt, p. 1 76.) In judging other views, Marx understands well how to find out
the weaknesses of the theory of stages. According to their teachings, says Marx,
'a history has existed but none exists any longer'. (Das Elend der Philosophie, German
translation by Bernstein und Kautsky, 8th Edition, Stuttgart 1 920, p. 1 04). He
merely does not notice that the same will be true of his teachings on the day when the
means of production will have been socialized .

describes. On the other hand, it admits no limits to its applicability.
It claims eternal validity, it is without beginning and without end.
But it does not evoke a dark fate whose 'will-less and impotent
bearers' we are. It discloses only the inner driving power of our own
will, revealing how it conforms to natural laws and why its existence
is necessary. This is insight, not into man's destiny, but into man's
doings.
In so far as 'scientific' Socialism is metaphysics, a chiliastic
promise of salvation, it would be vain and superfluous to argue
scientifically against it. It serves no useful purpose to fight mystical
dogmas with reason. There is no teaching fanatics. They must
break their heads against the wall. But Marxism is not merely
chiliasm. It is sufficiently influenced by the scientific spirit of the
nineteenth century to attempt to justify its doctrine rationally. With
these attempts, and these only, we shall deal in the following
chapters.

§I
The nature of sociery
HE idea of human destiny dominates all the more ancient views

T ofsocial existence.

Society progresses towards a goal fore-ordained
by the deity. Whoever thinks in this way is logically correct if, in
speaking of progress and retrogression, of revolution and counter­
revolution, of action and reaction he lays on these concepts the
emphasis adopted by so many historians and politicians. History is
judged according as it brings mankind nearer to the goal or carries
it farther away.
Social science, however, begins at the point where one frees
oneself from such habits, and indeed from all valuation. Social
science is indeed teleological in the sense in which every causal study
of the will must be. But its concept of purpose is wholly comprised in
the causal explanation. For social science causality remains the
fundamental principle of cognition, the maintenance of which must
not be impaired even by teleology. l Since it does not evaluate
purposes, it cannot speak of evolution to a higher plane, in the sense
let us say, of Hegel and Marx. For it is by no means proved that all
evolution leads upwards, or that every later stage is a higher one.
No more, of course, can it agree with the pessimistic philosophers of
history, who see in the historical process a decline, a progressive
approach to a bad end. To ask what are the driving forces of
historical evolution is to ask what is the nature of society and the
origin and causes of the changes in social conditions. What society
is, how it originates, how it changes - these alone can be the
problems which scientific sociology sets itself.
That the social life of men resembles the biological process is an
observation of ancient date. It lies at the basis of the famous legend
of Menenius Agrippa, handed down to us by Livy. Social science
did itself little good when, inspired by the triumph of Biology in

the nineteenth century, voluminous works developed this analogy
to the point of absurdity. What is the use of calling the products of
human activity 'social intercellular substance' l? Who was en­
lightened when scholars disputed which organ of the social body

corresponded to the central nervous system? The best comment on
this form of sociological study was the remark of an economist, to the
effect that anyone who compared money with blood and the circula­
tion of money with the circulation of blood would be making the
same contribution to economics as would be made to biology by a
man who compared blood with money and the blood-circulation
with the circulation of money. Modern biology has borrowed from
social science some ofits most important concepts - that of evolution,
of the division of labour, and of the struggle for existence. But it has
not stopped short at metaphorical phrases and conclusions by
analogy; rather has it proceeded to make profitable use of what it
had gained. On the other hand biological-sociology did nothing
but play a futile word-spinning game with the ideas it borrowed
back. The romantic movement, with its 'organic' theory of the
state has done even less to clear up our knowledge of social inter­
relations. Because it deliberately cold-shouldered the most important
achievement of social science up to that date - the system of classical
Political Economy - it was unable to utilize the doctrine of the
division of labour, that part of the classical system which must be the
starting point of all sociology, as it is of modern biology.2
Comparison with the biological organism should have taught

sociology one thing: that the organism can only be conceived as a
system of organs. This, however, merely means that the essence of
the organism is the division of labour. Only division oflabour makes
the parts become members ; it is in the collaboration of the members
1 As is done by Lilienfield (La pathologie sociale, Paris 1 896, p. 95). When a govern­
ment takes a loan from the House of Rothschild organic sociology conceives the process
as ,{ollows: 'La maison Rothschild agit, dans cette occasion, parfaitement en analogie
avec I'action d'un groupe de cellules qui, dans le corps humain, cooperent a la produc­
tion du sang necessaire a I'alimentation du cerveau dans I 'espoir d 'en etre indemnisees
par une reaction des cellules de la substance grise dont ils ont besoin pour s'activer de
nouveau et accurnuler de nouvelles energies.' (Ibid. p. 104.) This is the method
which claims that it stands on 'firm Ilround' and explores 'the Becominll of Phenomena
step by step, proceeding from the-simpler to the more complex. ' (See Lilienfield,
Zur Verteidigung der organischen Methode in der Soziologie, Berlin 1 898, p. 75).
I It is characteristic that just the romantics stress excessively society's organic
character, whereas liberal social philosophy has never done so. Quite understandably.
A social theory which was genuinely organic did not need to stress obtrusively this
attribute of its system.

NAT U R E O F S O C I E TY

that we recognize the unity of the system, the organism. 1 This is
true of the life of plants and animals as well as of society. As far as the
principle of the division of labour is concerned, the social body may
be compared with the biological. The division of labour is the
tertium comparationis of the old simile.
The division of labour is a fundamental principle of all forms of
life.· It was first detected in the sphere of social life when political
economists emphasized the meaning of the division of labour in the
social economy. Biology then adopted it, at the instigation in the first
place of Milne Edwards in 1 82 7 . The fact that we can regard the
division oflabour as a general law must not, however, prevent us from
recognizing the fundamental differences between division oflabour in
the animal and vegetable organism on the one hand and division of
labour in the social life of human beings on the other. Whatever we
imagine to be the origin, evolution, and meaning of the physiological
division of iabour, it dearly does not shed any light on the nature of
the sociological division of labour. The process that differentiates
and integrates homogeneous cells is completely different from that
which led to the growth of human society out of self-sufficient
individuals. In the second process, reason and will play their part
in the coalescence, by which the previously independent units form
a larger unit and become parts of a whole, whereas the intervention
of such forces in the first process is inconceivable.
Even where creatures such as ants and bees come together in
'animal communities', all movements and changes take place
instinctively and unconsciously. Instinct may very well have
operated at the beginning and in the earliest stages of social forma­
tion also. Man is already a member of a social body when he appears
as a thinking, willing creature, for the thinking man is inconceivable
as a solitary individual. 'Only amongst men does man become a
man' (Fichte) . The development of human reason and the develop­
ment of human society are one and the same process. All further
growth of social relations is entirely a matter of will. Society is the
product of thought and will. It does not exist outside thought and
will. Its being lies within man, not in the outer world. It is
projected from within outwards.

Society is co-operation; it is community in action.
To say that Society is an organism, means that society is division
of labour. 1 To do justice to this idea we must take into account all
the aims which men set themselves and the means by which these are
to be attained. It includes every inter-relation of thinking and willing
man. Modern man is a social being, not only as one whose material
needs could not be supplied in isolation, but also as one who has
achieved a development of reason and of the perceptive faculty
that would have been impossible except within society. Man is
inconceivable as an isolated being, for humanity exists only as a
social phenomenon and mankind transcended the stage of animality
only in so far as co-operation evolved the social relationships between
the individuals. Evolution from the human animal to the human
being was made possible by and achieved by means of social co­
operation and by that alone. And therein lies the interpretation of
Aristotle;s dictum that man is the

§2
The division of labour as the principle of social development
We are still far from understanding the ultimate and most
profound secret of life, the principle of the origin of organisms. Who
knows whether we shall ever discover it? All we know to-day is that
when organisms are formed, something which did not exist before is
created out of individuals. Vegetable and animal organisms are
more· than conglomerations of single cells, and society is more than
the sum of the individuals of which it is composed. We have not yet
grasped the whole significance of this fact. Our thoughts are still
limited by the mechanical theory of the conservation of energy and
of matter, which is never able to tell us how one can become two.
Here again, if we are to extend our knowledge of the nature of life,
understanding of the social organization will have to precede that
of the biological.
Historically division of labour originates in two facts of nature:
the inequality of human abilities and the variety of the external
conditions of human life on the earth. These two facts are really
one: the diversity of Nature, which does not repeat itself but creates
1

292

DIVIS ION OF LABOUR

the universe in infinite, inexhaustible variety. The special nature of
our inquiry, however, which is directed towards sociological know­
ledge, justifies us in treating these two aspects separately.
It is obvious that as soon as human action becomes conscious and
logical it must be influenced by these two conditions. They are
indeed such as almost to force the division of labour on mankind. 1
Old and young, men and women co-operate by making appropriate
use of their various abilities. Here also is the germ of the geographical
division of labour; man goes to the hunt and woman to the spring to
fetch water. Had the strength and abilities of all individuals and the
external conditions of production been everywhere equal the idea of
division of labour could never have arisen. Man would never of
himself have hit upon the idea of making the struggle for existence
easier by co-operation in the division of labour. No social life could
have arisen among men of equal natural capacity in a world which
was geographically uniform.' Perhaps men would have joined
together to cope with tasks which were beyond the strength of
individuals, but such alliances do not make a society. The relations
they create are transient, and endure only for the occasion that
brings them about. Their only importance in the origin of
social life is that they create a rapproachement between men
which brings with it mutual recognition of the difference in the
natural capacities of individuals and thus in turn gives rise to the
division of labour.
Once labour has been divided, the division itself exercises a
differentiating influence. The fact that labour is divided makes
possible further cultivation of individual talent and thus co-operation
becomes more and more productive. Through co-operation men are
1 Durkheim (De la division du tt'avail social, Paris 1893, p. 294 et seq.) endeavours
(following Comte and against Spencer) to prove that the division of labour prevails
not because, as the economists think, it increases output but as a result of the struggle
for existence. The denser the social mass the sharper the struggle for existence. This
forces individuals to specialize in their work, as otherwise they would not be able to
maintain themselves. But Durkheim overlooks the fact that the division of labour
makes this possible only because it makes labour more productive. Durkheim comes
to reject the theory of the importance of the greater productivity in the division of
labour through a false conception of the fundamental idea of utilitarianism and of the
law of the satiation of wants (op. cit., 2 1 8 et seq., 257 et seq.). His view that civilization is
called forth by changes in the volume and density of society is untenable. Population
grows because labour becomes more productive and is able to nourish more people, not
vice versa.
• On the important part played by the local variety of productive conditions in the
origin of the division of labour see von der Steinen, Unter den Naturoolkern Ze1ltral­
brasiliens, 2nd Edition, Berlin 1 897, p. 196 et seq.

S O C I ETY
able to achieve what would have been beyond them as individuals,
and even the work which individuals are capable of doing alone is
made more productive. But all this can only be grasped fully when
the conditions which govern increase of productivity under co-opera­
tion are set out with analytical precision.
The theory of the international division of labour is one of the
most important contributions of Classical Political Economy. It
shows that as long as - for any reasons - movements of capital and
labour between countries are prevented, it is the comparative, not
the absolute, costs of production which govern the geographical
division of labour. 1 When the same principle is applied to the
personal division of labour it is found that the individual enjoys an
advantage in co-operating not only with people superior to himself
in this or that capacity but also with those who are inferior to
himself in every relevant way. If, through his superiority to B, A
needs three hours' labour for the production of one unit of com­
modity p compared with B's five, and for the production of
commodity q two hours against B's four, then A will gain if he
confines his labour to producing q and leaves B to produce p. If each
gives sixty hours to producing both p and q, the result of A's labour
is 20P + 30q, of B's I 2P + I 5q, and for both together 32P + 45q. If
however, A confines himself to producing q alone he produces
sixty units in 1 20 hours, whilst B, if he confines himself to producing
p, produces in the same time twenty-hour units. The result of the
activity is then 24P + 60q, which, as p has for A a substitution value
of 3 :2q and for B one of 5 :4q, signifies a larger production than
32P + 45q. Therefore it is obvious that every expansion of the
personal division of labour brings advantages to all who take part
in it. He who collaborates with the less talented, less able, and less
industrious individuals gains an advantage equally as the man who
associated with the more talented, more able, and more industrious.
The advantage of the division of labour is mutual; it is not limited to
the case where work is done which the solitary individual could never
have carried out.
The �reater productivity of work under the division of labour is a
unifYing influence. It leads men to regard each other as comrades

in a joint struggle for welfare, rather than as competitors in a struggle
for existence. It makes friends out of enemies, peace out of war,
society out of individuals. 1

Organism and organization
Organism and organization are as different from each other as
life is from a machine, as a flower which is natural from one which is
artificial. In the natural plant each cell lives its own life for itself
while functioning reciprocally with the others. What we call living
is just this self-existence and self-maintenance. In the artificial plant
the separate parts are members of the whole only as far as the will of
he who united them, has been effective. Only to the extent to which
this will is effective are the parts within the organization inter-related.
Each part occupies only the place given to it, and leaves that place,
so to speak, only on instructions. Within this framework the parts
can live, that is, exist for themselves, only in so far as the creator has
put them alive into his creation. The horse which the driver has
harnessed to the cart lives as a horse. In the organization, the 'team',
the horse is just as foreign to the vehicle as is an engine to the car it
drives. The parts may use their life in opposition to the organization,
as, for instance, when the horse runs away with the carriage or the
tissue out of which the artificial flower is made disintegrates under
chemical action. Human organization is no different. Like society
it is a result of will. But in this case the will no more produces a living
social organism than the flower-maker produces a living rose. The
organization holds together as long as the creating will is effective,
no longer. The parts which compose the organization merge into the
whole only so far as the will of the creator can impose itself upon them
and their life can be fixed in the organization. In the battalion on
parade there is one will, the will of the commander. Everything else
so far as it functions within the organization is lifeless machinery. In
this destruction of the will, or that portion of it which does not serve

however, is nothing more than a technical aid of the division of labour. On the division
of labour in the sociology of Thomas Aquinas see Schreiber. Die volkwirtschaftlichen

the purposes of the body of troops, lies the essence of military drill.
The soldier in the phalangial order, fighting in line, in which the
body of troops must be nothing more than an organization - is
drilled. Within the mass there is no life. Whatever life the individual
lives is by the side of, or outside the body of troops - against it
perhaps, but never in it. Modern warfare, based on the skirmisher's
personal enterprise, has to make use of the individual soldier, of his
thought and his will. So the army no longer simply drills the soldier.
It seeks to educate him.
Organization is an association based on authority, organism is
mutuality. The primitive thinker always sees things as having been
organized from outside, never as having grown themselves, organically.
He sees the arrow which he has carved, he knows how it came into
existence and how it was set in motion. So he asks of everything he
sees, who made it and who sets it in motion. He inquires after the
creation of every form of iife, the authors of every change in nature,
and discovers an animistic explanation. Thus the Gods are born.
Man sees the organized community with its contrast of rulers and
ruled, and, accordingly, he tries to understand life as an organization,
not as an organism. Hence the ancient conception of the head as the
master of the body, and the use of the same term 'head' for the
chief of the organization.
In recognizing the nature of the organism and sweeping away the
exclusiveness of the concept of organization, science made one of its
great steps forward. With all deference to earlier thinkers one may
say that in the domain of Social Science this was achieved mainly in
the eighteenth century, and that Classical Political Economy and its
immediate precursors played the chief part. Biology took up the
good work, flinging off all animistic and vitalistic beliefs. For
modern biology the head is no longer the crown, the ruler of the
body. In the living body there is no longer leader and followers, a
contrast of sovereign and subjects, of means and purpose. There are
only members, organs.
To seek to organize society is just as crazy as it would be to tear
a living plant to bits in order to make a new one out of the dead
parts. An organization of mankind can oniy be conceived after the
living social organism has been killed. The collectivist movements
are therefore fore-doomed to failure. It may be possible to create an
organization embracing all mankind. But this would always be
2 96

T H E I N D I V I D U A L A ND S O C I E T Y
merely an organization, side by side with which social life would
continue. It could be altered and destroyed by the forces of social
life, and it certainly would be destroyed from the moment it tried to
rebel against these forces. To make Collectivism a fact one must first
kill all social life, then build up the collectivist state. The Bolshevists
are thus quite logical in wishing to dissolve all traditional social ties,
to destroy the social edifice built up through countless centuries, in
order to erect a new structure on the ruins. Only they overlook the
fact that isolated individu�ls, between whom no kind of social
relations exist, can no longer be organized.
Organizations are possible only as long as they are not directed
against the organic or do it any injury. All attempts to coerce the
living will of human beings into the service of something they do not
want must fail. An organization cannot flourish unless it is founded
on the will of those organized and serves their purposes.

§4
The individual and society
Society is not mere reciprocity. There is reciprocity amongst
animals, for example when the wolf eats the lamb or when the wolf
and she-wolf mate. Yet we do not speak of animal societies or of a
society of wolves. Wolf and lamb, wolf and she-wolf, are indeed
members of an organism - the organism of Nature. But this
organism lacks the specific characteristic of the social organism: it is
beyond the reach ofwill and action. For the same reason, the relation
between the sexes is not, as such, a social relation. When a man and
a woman come together they follow the law which assigns to them
their place in Nature. Thus far they are ruled by instinct. Society
exists only where willing becomes a co-willing and action co-action.
To strive jointly towards aims which alone individuals could not
reach at all, or not with equal effectiveness - that is society. 1
Therefore, Society is not an end but a means, the means by which
each individual member seeks to attain his own ends. That society is
possible at all is due to the fact that the will of one person and the

directly from bi-sexuality. (Guyau, Sittlichkeit olme Pjlicht, translated by Scb.wan;,

will of another find themselves linked in a joint endeavour. Com­
munity of work springs from community of will. Because I can get
what I want only if my fellow citizen gets what he wants, his will and
action become the means by which I can attain my own end. Because
my willing necessarily includes his willing, my intention canfiot be to
frustrate his will. On this fundamental fact all social life is built Up. l
The principle of the division of labour revealed the nature of
the growth of society. Once the significance of the division oflabour
had been grasped, social knowledge developed at an extraordinary
pace, as we see from a comparison between Kant and those who
came after him. The doctrine of the division oflabour as put foward
by eighteenth-century economists, was far from fully developed when
Kant wrote. It had yet to be made precise by the Ricardian Theory
ofInternational Trade. But the Doctrine of the Harmony of Interests
had already anticipated its far-reaching application to social theory.
Kant was untouched by these ideas. His only explanation of society,
therefore, is that there is an impulse in human beings to form a
society, and a second contrary impulse that seeks to split up society.
The antagonism of these two tendencies is used by Nature to lead
men towards the ultimate goal to which it wishes to lead them.s It
is difficult to imagine a more threadbare idea than such an attempt to
explain society by the interplay of two impulses, the impulse 'to
1 Fouillee argues as follows against the utilitarian theory of society, which calls
society a 'moyen universal' (Belot): 'Tout moyen n'a qu'une valeur provisoire; le
jour ou un instrument dont je me servais me devient inutile ou nuisible, je le mets de
c6te. Si la societe n'est qu'un moyen, le jour DU, exceptionellement, elle se trouvera
contraire a mes fins, je me delivrerai des lois sociales et moyens sociaux . . . . Aucune
consideration sociale ne pourra emp�cher la revolte de l 'individu tant qu'on ne lui
aura pas montre que la societe est etablie pour des fins qui sont d'abord et avant tout
ses vraies fins a lui-meme et qui, de plus, ne sont pas simplement dc;s fins de plaisir
ou d'interet, l'interet n'etant que le plaisir differe et attendu pour l'avenir . . . L'idee
d 'interet est precisement ce qui divise les hommes, malgre les rapprochements qu'elle
peut produire lorsqu'il y a convergence d 'interets sur certains points. ' Fouillee,
Humanitaires et libertaires au point de vue sociologique et moral, Paris 1 914, p. 146 et seq.;
see also Guyau, Die englische Ethik der Gegenwart, translated by Peusner, Leipzig 1914,
p. 372, et seq. Fouillee does not see that the provisional value which society gets a s a
means, lasts as long as the conditions of human life, given by nature, continue un­
changed and as long as man continues to recognize the advantages of human co-opera­
tion. The 'eternal', not merely provisional, existence of society follows from the
eternity of the conditions on which it is built up. Those in power may demand of
social theory that it should serve them by preventing the individual from revolting
against sodet-y, but this is by no means a scientific demand. BesideS no social theory
could, as easily as the utilitarian, induce the social individual to enrol himself volun­
tarily in the social union. But when an individual shows that he is an enemy of society
there is nothing left for society to do but make him harmless.

socialize oneself' and the impulse 'to isolate oneself'. Obviously it
goes no farther than the attempt to explain the effects of opium from
the virtus dormitiva, cuius est natura sensus assupire.
Once it has been perceived that the division of labour is the
essence of society, nothing remains of the antithesis between
individual and society. The contradiction between individual
principle and social principle disappears.

§5
The development of the division of labour

In so far as the individual becomes a social being under the
influence ofblind instinct, before thought and will are fully conscious,
the formation of society cannot be the subject of sociological inquiry.
But this does not mean that Sociology must shift the task of explaining
the origins of society on to another science, accepting the social web
of mankind as a given fact. For if we decide - and this is the imme­
diate consequence of equating society and division of labour - that
the structure of society was incomplete at the appearance of the
thinking and willing human being and that the constructive process
is continuous throughout history, then we must seek a principle which
makes this evolution intelligible to us. The economic theory of the
division of labour gives us this principle. It has been said that the
happy accident which made possible the birth of civilization was the
fact that divided labour is more productive than labour without
division. The division of labour extends by the spread of the realiza­
tion that the more labour is divided the more productive it is. In
this sense the extension of the division of labour is economic progress:
it brings production nearer to its goal - the greatest possible satisfac­
tion of wants, and this progress is sociological progress also, for it
involves the intensification of the social relation.
It is only in this sense, and if all teleological or ethical valuation is
excluded, that it is legitimate to use the expression 'progress' socio­
logically in historical inquiry. We believe that we can observe a
certain tendency in the changes of social conditions and we examine
each single change separately, to see whether and how far this
assumption is compatible with it. It may be that we make various
299

S O C I ETY

assumptions of this kind, each of which corresponds in like measure
to experience. The problem next arises of the relations between these
assumptions, whether they are independent of each other or whether
they are connected internally. We should then have to go further,
and define the nature of the connection. But all that this amounts to
is a study, free from valuation and based on a hypothesis, of the
course of successive changes.
If we disregard those theories of evolution that are naively built
up on value judgments, we shall find, in the majority of the theories
claiming to interpret social evolution, two outstanding defects which
render them unsatisfactory. The first is that their evolutionary
principle is not connected with society as such. Neither Comte's
law of the three stages of the human mind nor Lamprecht's five
stages of social-psychical development gives any clue to the inner
and necessary connection between evolution of the mind and evolu­
tion of society. We are shown how society behaves when it has
entered a new stage, but we want to know more, namely by what
law society originates and transforms itself. The changes which we
see as social changes are treated by such theories as facts acting on
society from outside; but we need to understand them as the workings
of a constant law. The second defeat is that all these theories are
'stage' theories (Stufentheorien) . For the stage-theories there is really
no such thing as evolution, that is, no continuous change in which
we can recognize a definite trend. The statements of these theories
do not go beyond establishing a definite sequence of events; they give
no proof of the causal connection between the stages constituting the
sequence. At best they succeed in establishing parallels between the
sequence of events in different nations. But it is one thing to divide
human life into childhood, youth, maturity, and old age, it is another
to reveal the law which governs the growth and decay of the organism.
A certain arbitrariness attaches to every theory of stages. The
delimitation of the stages always fluctuates.
Modern German economic history has undoubtedly done right
in making the division of labour the basis of its theory of evolution.
But it has not been able to free itselffrom the old traditional scheme of
development by stages. Its theory is stiU a stage-theory. Thus
Bucher distinguishes the stage of the closed domestic economy (pure
production for one's own use, barterless economy), the stage of town
economy (production for clients, the stage of direct exchange) , and
3 00

the stage of national economy (production for markets, the stage of
the circulation of goods) . 1 Schmoller differentiates the periods of
village economy, town economy, territorial economy, and state
economy" Philippovich distinguishes closed domestic economy and
trade economy, and within trade economy he finds the period of the
locally limited trade, the period of trade controlled by the state and
limited to the state area, and the period of free trade (developed
national economy, Capitalism) .8 Against these attempts to force
evolution into a general scheme many grave objections have been
raised. We need not discuss what value such classification may have
in revealing the characteristics of clearly defined historical epochs and
how far they may be admitted as aids to description. At any rate
they should be used with great discretion. The barren dispute over
the economic life of the nations of antiquity shows how easily such
classifying may lead to our mistaking the shadow of scholastic word­
splitting for the substance of historical reality. For sociological study
the stage-theories are useless.' They mislead us in regard to one of the
most important problems of history - that of deciding how far
historical evolution is continuous. The solution of this problem
usually takes the form either of an assumption, that social evolution
- which it should be remembered is the development of the division
of labour - has moved in an uninterrupted line, or by the assump­
tion that each nation has progressed step-by-step over the same
ground. Both assumptions are beside the point. It is absurd to say
that evolution is uninterrupted when we can clearly discern periods
of decay in history, periods when the division of labour has retro­
gressed. On the other hand, the progress achieved by individual
nations by reaching a higher stage of the division of labour is never
completely lost. It spreads to other nations and hastens their evolu­
tion. The fall of the ancient world undoubtedly put back economic
evolution for centuries. But more recent historical research has
shown that the ties connecting the economic civilization of antiquity
with that of the Middle Ages were much stronger than people used

to assume. The Exchange Economy certainly suffered badly under
the storm ofthe great migration of peoples, but it survived them. The
towns on which it depended, were not entirely ruined, and a link
was soon made between the remnants of town-life and the new
development of traffic by barter. 1 In the civilization of the towns a
fragment of the social achievements of antiquity was preserved and
carried over into the life of the Middle Ages.
Progress in the division of labour depends entirely on a realiza­
tion of its advantages, that is, of its higher productivity. The truth
of this first became fully evident through the free-trade doctrines of
the physiocrats and the classical eighteenth-century political
economy. But ill rudiments it is found in all arguments favouring
peace, wherever peace is praised, or war condemned. History is a
struggle between two principles, the peaceful principle, which
advances the development of trade, and the militarist-imperialist
principle, which interprets human society not as a friendly division
of labour but as the forcible repression of some of its members by
others. The imperialistic principle continually regains the upper
hand. The liberal principle cannot maintain itself against it until
the inclination for peaceful labour inherent in the masses shall have
struggled through to full recognition of its own importance as a
principle of social evolution. Wherever the imperialistic principle is
in force peace can only be local and temporary: it never lasts longer
than the facts which created it. The mental atmosphere with which
Imperialism surrounds itself is little suited to the promotion of the
growth of the division of labour within state frontiers ; it practically
prohibits the extension of the division of labour beyond the political­
military barriers which separate the states. The division of labour
needs liberty and peace. Only when the modern liberal thought of
the eighteenth century had supplied a philosophy of peace and social
collaboration was the basis laid for the astonishing development of
the economic civilization of that age - an age branded by the latest
imperialistic and socialistic doctrines as the age of crass materialism,
egotism and capitalism.
Nothing could be more perverted than the conclusions drawn in
this connection by the materialistic conception of history, which
represents the development of social ideology as dependent on the

stage of technical evolution which has been attained. Nothing is
more erroneous than Marx's well-known saying: 'The handmill
produces a society with feudal lords, the steam-mill a society with
industrial capitalists.' 1 It is not even formally correct. To try and
explain social evolution through the evolution of technique is merely
to side-track the problem without in any way solving it. For on such
a conception, how are we to explain technical evolution itself?
Ferguson showed that the development of technique depends on
social conditions, and that each age gets as far in technique as is
permitted by the stages it has reached in the social division of labour.'
Technical advances are possible only where the division oflabour has
prepared the way for their application. The mass manufacturing of
shoes presupposes a society in which the production of shoes for
hundreds of thousands or millions of human beings can be united in
a few enterprises. In a society of self-sufficing peasants there is no
possible use for the steam mill. Only the division of labour could
inspire the idea of placing mechanical forces at the service of
manufacture.
To trace the origin of everything concerned with society in the
development of the division oflabour has nothing in common with the
gross and naive materialism of the technological and other material­
istic theories of history. Nor does it by any means signify, as disciples
of the idealistic philosophy are apt to maintain, an inadmissible
limitation of the concept of social relations. Neither does it
restrict society to the specifically material. That part of social life
which lies beyond the economic is indeed the ultimate aim, but the
ways which lead to it are governed by the law of all rational action;
wherever they come into question there is economic action.

gave to his conception of history he avoided the rigidity of this earliest version. Behind
such indefinite expressions as 'productive forces' and 'conditions of production' are
hidden the critical doubts which Marx may meanwhile have experienced. But obscur­
ity. opening the way to multitudinous interpretations, does not make an untenable
theory tenable.

a All that remains of the materialist conception of history, which appeared with the
widest possible claims, is the discovery that all human and social action is decisively
influenced by the scarcity of goods and the disutility of labour. But the Marxists can
least admit just this, for all they say about the future socialist order of society dis­
regards these two economic conditions.

Changes in the individual in sociery
The most important effect of the division of labour is that it
turns the independent individual into a dependent social being.
Under the division of labour social man changes, like the cell which
adapts itself to be part of an organism. He adapts himself to new
ways of life, permits some energies and organs to atrophy and
develops others. He becomes one-sided. The whole tribe of
romantics, the unbending laudatores temporis acti, have deplored this
fact. For them the man of the past who developed his powers
'harmoniously' is the ideal : an ideal which alas no longer inspires
our degenerate age. They recommend retrogression in the division
of labour, hence their praise of agricultural labour, by which they
always mean the almost seif-sufficing peasant. '
Here, again the modem socialist outdoes the rest. Marx promises
that in the higher phase of the communist society 'the enslaving
subjection of individuals under the division of labour, and with
this also the contrast between mental and bodily labour, shall have
disappeared.'2 Account will be taken ofthe human 'need for change' .
'Alternation of mental and bodily labour' will 'safeguard man's
harmonious development.'8
We have already dealt with this illusion.' Were it possible to
achieve all human aims with only that amount of labour which does
not itself cause any discomfort but at the same time relieves the

private industry and in government business too,' that man needs 'an all round, I might
say a sphere-round field of activity.' If the 'division of labour in large cities or indus­
trial or mining provinces cuts up man, the completely free man, into wheels, rollers,
spokes, shafts, etc., forces on him an utterly one-sided scope in the already one-sided
field of the provisioning of one single want, how can one then demand that this frag­
ment should accord with the whole complete life and with its law, or with legality;
how should the rhombuses, triangles, and figures of all kinds accord separately with
the great sphere of politica1 life and its law?' (See Adam MUller, Ausgewiihlte Abhand­

abolishes the specialist and the one-track mind.' And he blames Proudhon, 'who

SOCIETY

§7
Social regression
Social evolution - in the sense of evolution of the division of
labour - is a will-phenomenon: it depends entirely on the human
will. We do not consider whether one is justified in regarding every
advance in the division of labour and hence in the intensification
of the social bond, as a rise to a higher stage; we must ask whether
such a development is a necessary phenomenon. Is an ever greater
development of society the content of history? Is it possible for society
to stand still or retrogress?
We must reject a priori any assumption that historical evolution
is provided with a goal by any 'intention', or 'hidden plan' of Nature,
such as Kant imagined and Hegel and Marx had in mind; but we
cannot avoid the inquiry whether a principle might not be found to
demonstrate that continuous social growth is inevitable. The first
principle that offers itself to our attention is the principle of natural
selection. More highly developed societies attain greater material
wealth than the less highly developed; therefore they have more
prospect of preserving their members from misery and poverty.
They are also better equipped to defend themselves from the enemy.
One must not be misled by the observation that richer and more
civilized nations were often crushed in war by nations less wealthy
and civilized. Nations in an advanced stage of social evolution have
always been able at least to resist a superior force of less developed
nations. It is only decaying nations, civilizations inwardly disinte­
grated, which have fallen a prey to nations on the up grade. Where
a more highly organized society has succumbed to the attack of a
less developed people, the victors have in the end been culturally
submerged, accepting the economic and social order, and even the
language and faith of the conquered race.
The superiority of the more highly developed societies lies not
only in their material welfare but also quantitatively in the number
of their members and qualitatively in the greater solidity of their
internal structure. For this, precisely, is the key to higher social
development: the widening of the social range, the inclusion in the
division of labour of more human beings and its stronger grip on
each individual. The more highly developed society differs from the
3 06

SOCIAL REGRESSION

less developed in the closer union of its members; this precludes ·the
violent solution of internal conflict and forms externally a closed
defensive front against any enemy. In less developed societies, where
the social bond is still weak, and between the separate parts of which
there exists a confederation for the purposes of war rather than true
solidarity based on joint work and economic co-operation - dis­
agreement breaks out more easily and more quickly than in highly
developed societies. For the military confederation has no firm and
lasting hold upon its members. By its very nature it is merely a
temporary bond which is upheld by the prospect of momentary
advantage, but dissolves as soon as the enemy has been defeated and
the scramble for the booty sets in. In fighting against the less
developed societies the more developed ones have always found that
their greatest advantage lay in the lack of unity in the enemy's ranks.
Only temporarily do the nations in a lower state of organization
manage to co-operate for great military enterprises. Internal dis­
unity has always dispersed their armies quickly. Take for example
the Mongol raids on the Central European civilization of the
thirteenth century or the efforts of the Turks to penetrate into the
West. The superiority of the industrial over the military type of
society, to use Herbert Spencer's expression, consists largely in the
fact that associations which are merely military always fall to pieces
through internal disunity. 1
But there is another circumstance which advances further social
development. It has been shown that it is to the interest of all
members of society that the social range should be extended. For a
highly developed social organism it is by no means a matter of
indifference whether or not nations outside its range continue to
lead a self-sufficient existence on a lower plane of social evolution.
1 The romantic-militarist notion of the military superiority of the nations which
have made little progress in Capitalism, completely refuted afresh by the World War,
arises from the view that what tells in a fight is man's physical strength alone. This,
however, is not completely true, even of the fights of the Homeric Age. Not physical
but mental power decides a fight. On these mental powers depend the fighters' tactics
and the way he is armed. The A B C of the art of warfare is to have the superiority
at the decisive moment, though otherwise one may be numerically weaker than the
enemy. The A B C of the preparation for war is to set up armies as strong as
possible and to provide them-with all war materials in the best way. One has to stress
this only because people are again endeavouring to obscure these connections, by
trying to differentiate between the military and economic-political causes of victory
and defeat in war. It always has been and always will be the fact, that victory or defeat
are decided by the whole social position of the combatants before their armies meet in
battle.

S O C I ETY
It is to the interest of the more advanced organism to draw the less
advanced into the area of its economic and social community, even
though its persistence in remaining on a lower plane makes it
politically and militarily innocuous, and even though no immediate
advantages are likely to accrue from the occupation of its territory,
in which, presumably, the natural conditions of production are
unfavourable. We have seen that it is always an advantage to widen
the range of workers in a society that divides labour, so that even a
more efficient people may have an interest in co-operating with a
less efficient. This is what so often drives nations of a high social
development to expand their field of economic activity by absorbing
hitherto inaccessible territories.

The opening up of the backward

regions of the Near and Far East, of Africa and America, cleared the
way for a world-wide economic community, so that shortly before
the World War we were in siJ!:ht of realizinJ!: the dream of an
<:ecumenical society. Has the wir merely interrupted this develop­
ment for a brief period or has it utterly destroyed it? Is it conceivable
that this development can cease, that society can even retrogress?
This problem cannot be approached except in connection with
another: the problem of the death of nations. It is customary to talk
of nations ageing and dying, of young and old communities. The
comparison is lame - as are all comparisons - and in discussing such
things we are well advised to discard metaphorical phrases. What is
the core of the problem that here presents itself?
It is clear that we must not confuse it with another not less difficult
problem, the problem of the changes of the national quality. A
thousand or fifteen hundred years ago the Germans spoke a dif­
ferent language from that of to-day, but we should not think of
saying, on that account, that German medieval culture was 'dead'.
On the contrary we see in the German culture an uninterrupted
evolutionary chain, stretching (without mentioning lost monuments
of literature) from the 'Heliand', and Otfried's Gospels to the present
day. We do indeed say of the Pomeranians and Prussians, who
in the course of centuries have been assimilated by the German
colonists, that they have died out, yet we shall hardly maintain that
as nations they grew 'old'. To carry through the simile one would
have to talk of nations that had died young. We are not concerned
with national transformation; our problem is different. Neither does
the decay of states come into the question, for this phenomenon
308

SOCIAL REGRESSION
sometimes appears as a sequence to the ageing nations and sometimes
independently of it. The fall of the ancient state of Poland had
nothing to do with any decay of Polish civilization or of the Polish
people. It did not stop the social development of Poland.
The facts which are present in practically all the examples
brought forward ofthe ageing of a culture are: a decline in population,
a diminution of welfare, and the decay of the towns. The historical
significance of all these phenomena becomes clear as soon as we
conceive of the ageing of nations as the retrogression of the social
division of labour and of society. The decline of the ancient world
for instance, was a social retrogression. The decline of the Roman
Empire was only a result of the disintegration of ancient society
which after reaching a high level of division of labour sank back into
an almost moneyless economy. Thus towns were depopulated and
thus, also, did the population of the countryside diminish and want
and u.lsery set in simply because an economic order working on a
lower level in respect of the social division oflabour is less productive.
Technical skill was gradually lost, artistic talent decayed, scientific
thought was slowly extinguished. The word which most aptly
describes this process is "disintegration. The Classical culture died
because Classical society retrogressed. 1
The death of nations is the retrogression of the social relation, the
retrogression of the division of labour. Whatever may have been the
cause in individual cases, it has always been the cessation of the
disposition to social co-operation which actually effected the
decline. This may once have seemed an incomprehensible riddle to
us, but now that we watch with terror the process at work in our own
experience we come nearer to understanding it, though we still fail
to recognize the deepest, most ultimate causes of the change.
It is the social spirit, the spirit of social co-operation, which forms,
develops, and upholds societies. Once it is lost, the society falls
apart again. The death of a nation is social retrogression, the decline
from the division of labour to self-sufficiency. The social organism
disintegrates into the cells from which it began. Man remains, but
society dies. a
There is no evidence that social evolution must move steadily

upwards in a straight line. Social standstill and social retrogression
are historical facts which we cannot ignore. World history is the
graveyard of dead civilizations, and in India and Eastern Asia we
see large-scale examples of civilization at a standstill.
Our literary and artistic cliques whose exaggerated opinion of
their own trifling productions contrast so vividly with the modesty and
self-criticism of the really great artists, say that it does not matter
much whether economic evolution continues so long as inner culture
is intensified. But all inner culture requires external means for its
realization, and these external means can be attained only by
economic effort. When the productivity oflabour decays through the
retrogression of social co-operation the decay of inner culture follows.
All the older civilizations were born and grew up without being
fully conscious of the basic laws of cultural evolution and the
significance of division of labour and co-operation. In the course of
their deveiopment they had often to combat tendencies and move­
ments inimical to civilization. Often they triumphed over these, but
sooner or later they fell. They succumbed to the spirit of disinte­
gration. Through the social philosophy of Liberalism men became
conscious of the laws of social evolution for the first time, and for the
first time clearly recognized the basis of civilization and cultural
progress. Those were days when hopes for the future ran high.
Unimagined vistas seemed to be opening up. But it was not to be.
Liberalism had to meet the opposition of militaristic-nationalist and,
above all, of socialist-communist doctrines which tended to bring
about social dissolution. The nationalist theory calls itself organic,
the socialist theory calls itself social, but in reality both are dis­
organizing and anti-social in their effect.
Of all accusations against the system of Free Trade and Private
Property, none is more foolish than the statement that it is anti­
social and individualistic and that it atomizes the body social. Trade
does not disintegrate, as romantic enthusiasts for the autarky of small
portions of the earth's surface assert; it unites. The division oflabour
is what first makes social ties: it is the social element pure and simple.
Whoever advocates the economic self-sufficiency of nations and
states, seeks to disintegrate the recumenicai society; whoever seeks to
destroy the social division oflabour within a nation by means of class
war is anti-social.
A decline of the recumenical society, which has been slowly
310

SOCIAL EVOLUTION

forming itself during the last two hundred years under the influence
of the gradual germination of the liberal idea, would be a world
catastrophe absolutely without parallel in history as we know it. No
nation would be spared. Who then would rebuild the shattered
world?

§8
Private property and social evolution
The division of individuals into owners and non-owners is an
outcome of the division of labour.
The second great sociological achievement of Classical Political
Economy and the 'individualistic' social theory of the eighteenth
century was to recognize the sociai function of private property.
From the older point of view property was always considered more or
less a privilege of the Few, a raid upon the common stock, an insti­
tution regarded ethically as an evil, if sometimes as an inevitable one.
Liberalism was the first to recognize that the social function of private
ownership in the means of production is to put the goods into the
hands of those who know best how to use them, into the hands, that
is, of the most expert managers. Nothing therefore is more foreign
to the essence of property than special privileges for special property
and protection for special producers. Any kind of constraint such as
exclusive rights and other privileges of producers, are apt to obstruct
the working of the social function of property. Liberalism fights such
institutions as vigorously as it opposes every attempt to limit the
freedom of the worker.
The owner takes nothing away from anyone. No one can say
that he goes short because of another's abundance. It is flattering
the envious instincts of the masses to give them a calculation of how
much more the poor man would have to dispose of, if property were
equally distributed. What is overlooked is the fact that the volume of
production and of the social income are not fixed and unchangeable
but depend essentially upon the distribution of property. If this is
interfered with, there is danger that property may fall into the hands
of those not so competent to maintain it, those whose foresight is
less, whose disposal of their means is less productive; this would
3II

S O C I ETY
necessarily reduce the amount produced. 1 The ideas of distributive
Communism are atavistic, harking back to the times before social
relations existed or reached their present stage of development, when
the yield of production was correspondingly much lower. The land­
less man of an economic order based on production without exchange
is quite logical in making the redistribution of fields the goal of his
ambition. But the modern proletarian misunderstands the nature of
social production when he hankers after a similar redistribution.
Liberalism combats the socialist ideal of transferring the means of
production to the hands of organized society with the argument that
socialist production would give a lower yield. Against this the
Socialism of the Hegelian school seeks to prove that the evolution of
history leads inevitably to the abolition of private ownership in the
means of production.
It was the view of Lassalle that 'the course of all legal history
consists, generaily speaking, in an ever greater limitation of the
property of the individual, and in placing more and more objects
outside private ownership.' The tendency to enlarge the freedom of
property which is read into historical evolution is only apparent.
However much the 'idea of the increasingly rapid reduction of the
sphere of private property as a principle working in the cultural and
historical development of law could be held to be paradoxical',
yet, according to Lassalle it survived the most detailed examination.
Unfortunately Lassalle produced no details of the examination of this
idea. According to his own words he 'honoured it (the idea) with a
few very superficial glances instead'" Neither has anyone since
Lassalle's time undertaken to provide a proof. But even if the
attempt had been made, this fact would by no means have demon­
strated the necessity of the development in question. The conceptual
constructions of speculative jurisprudence steeped in the Hegelian
spirit serve at best to exhibit historical tendencies of evolution in
the past.

That the evolutionary tendency thus discovered must

necessarily continue to develop is a thoroughly arbitrary assumption.
Only if it could be shown that the force behind evolution was still
active would the hypothetical proof which is needed be adduced.
The Hegelian Lassalle did nothing of the kind. For him, the matter
is disposed of when he realizes 'that this progressive reduction of the
sphere of private property is based on nothing else than the positive
development of human liberty' . 1 Having fitted his law of evolution
into the great Hegelian scheme of historical evolution, he had done
all that his school could ask.

Marx saw the faults in the Hegelian scheme of evolution. He too
holds it to be an indisputable truth that the course of history leads
from private property to common property. But unlike Hegel and
Lassalle he does not deal with the idea of property and the juristic
concept of property. Private property 'in its political-economic
tendencies' is drifting towards its dissolution, 'but only by a develop­
ment independent of it, of which it is unconscious, which is taking
place against its will, and is conditioned by the nature of the question;
only by creating the proletariat qua proletariat, the misery that is
conscious of its spiritual and physical misery, the dehumanization
that is conscious of its dehumanization' . I Thus the doctrine of the
class struggle is introduced as the driving element of historical
evolution.

§
The cause of social evolution

HE simplest way to depict the evolution of society is to show the
Tdistinction between two evolutionary tendencies which are related
to each other in the same way as intension and extension. Society
develops subjectively and objectively; subjectively by enlarging its
membership, objectively by enlarging the aims of its activities.
Originally confined to the narrowest circles of people, to immediate

until eventually it includes all mankind. This process, still far from
complete and never at any point in history completed, is finite.
When all men on earth form a unitary system of division oflabour, it
will have reached its goal. Side by side with this extension of the
social bond goes a process of intensification. Social action embraces
more and more aims ; the area in which the individual provides for
his own consumption becomes constantly narrower. We need not
pause at this stage to ask whether this process will eventually result
in the specialization of all productive activity.
Social development is always a collaboration for joint action ; the
social relationship always means peace, never war. Death-dealing
actions and war are anti-social. 1 All those theories which regard
human progress as an outcome of conflicts between human groups
have overlooked this truth.

Darwinism
The individual's fate is determined unequivocally by his Being.
Everything that is has necessarily proceeded from his Becoming,
and everything that will be results necessarily f"rom that which is.

State, Helsingfors 1913, p. 276 et seq.

DARWINISM

The situation at any given moment is the consummation of history. 1
He who understood it completely would be able to foresee the whole
future. For a long time it was thought necessary to exclude human
volition and action from the determination of events, for the special
significance of 'imputation' - that thought-process peculiar to all
rational action - had not been grasped. It was believed that causal
explanation was incompatible with imputation. This is no longer
so. Economics, the Philosophy of Law, and Ethics have cleared up
the problem of imputation sufficiently to remove the old misunder­
standings.
If, to simplify our study, we analyse the unity we call the indi­
vidual into certain complexes it must be clearly understood that
only the heuristic value of the division can justify our doing so.
Attempts to separate, according to external characteristics, what is
essentially similar can never survive ultimate examination. Only
subject to this admission can we proceed to group the determinants
of individual life.
That which man brings into the world at birth, the innate, we
call racial inheritance or, for short, the race.S The innate in man is
the precipitate of the history of all his ancestors, their fate, and all
their experiences. The life and fate of the individual do not start at
birth, but stretch back into the infinite, unimaginable past. The
descendant inherits from the ancestors; this fact is outside the sphere
of the dispute over the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
After birth, direct experience begins. The individual begins to
be influenced by his environment. Together with what is innate, this
influence produces the individual's Being in each moment of his
life. The environment is natural in the form of soil, climate, nourish­
ment, fauna, flora, in short, external natural surroundings. It is
social in the shape of society. The social forces acting on the indi­
vidual are language, his position in the process of work and exchange,
ideology and the forces of compulsion: unrestrained and ordered
coercion. The ordered organization of coercion we call the State.
Since Darwin we have been inclined to regard the dependence
of human life on natural environment as a struggle against antagon­
istic forces. There was no objection to this as long as people did not

transfer the figurative expression to a field where it was quite out of
place and was bound to cause grave errors. When the formulas of
Darwinism, which had sprung from ideas taken over by Biology from
Social Science, reverted to Social Science, people forgot what the
ideas had originally meant. Thus arose that monstrosity, sociological
Darwinism, which, ending in a romantic glorification of war and
murder, was peculiarly responsible for the overshadowing of liberal
ideas and for creating the mental atmosphere which led to the World
War and the social struggles of to-day.
It is well known that Darwin was under the influence of Malthus's
Essay on the Principle of Population. But Malthus was far from
believing struggle to be a necessary social institution. Even Darwin,
when he speaks of the struggle for existence, does not always mean the
destructive combat of living creatures, the life or death struggle for
feedin� places and females. He often uses the expression fi�ratively
to sho;' the dependence of living beings on each other and on thei�
surroundings. 1 It is a misunderstanding to take the phrase quite
literally, for it is a metaphor. The confusion is worse confounded
when people equate the struggle for existence with the war of exter­
mination between human beings, and proceed to construct a social
theory based on the necessity of struggle.
The Malthusian Theory of Population is
what its critics,
ignorant of sociology, always overlook - merely a part of the social
theory of Liberalism. Only within such a framework can it be
understood. The core of liberal social theory is the theory of the
division of labour. Only side by side with this can one make use of
the Law of Population to interpret social conditions. Society is the
union of human beings for the better exploitation of the natural
conditions of existence; in its very conception it abolishes the struggle
between human beings and substitutes the mutual aid which pro­
vides the essential motive of all members united in an organism.
Within the limits of society there is no struggle, only peace. Every
struggle suspends in effect the social community. Society as a whole,
as organism, does fight a struggle for existence against forces inimical
to it. But inside, as far as society has absorbed individuals com­
pletely, there is only collaboration. For society is nothing but
collaboration. Within modern society even war cannot break all

DARW I N I S M
social ties. Some remain, though loosened, in a war between states
which acknowledge the binding force of International Law. Thus a
fragment of peace survives even in wartime.
Private ownership in the means of production is the regu­
lating principle which, within society, balances the limited means
of subsistence at society's disposal with the less limited ability
of the consumers to increase. By making the share in the social
product which falls to each member of society depend on the product
economically imputed to him, that is, to his labour and his property,
the elimination of surplus human beings by the struggle for existence,
as it rages in the vegetable and animal kingdom, is replaced by a
reduction in the birth-rate as a result of social forces. 'Moral
restraint', the limitations of offspring imposed by social positions,
replaces the struggle for existence.
In society there is no struggle for existence. It is a grave error to
suooose that the loe:icallv develooed social theorv of liberalism could
le�d to any other �oncl�sion. Certain isolated phrases in Malthus's
essay, which might be interpreted otherwise, are easily accounted for
by the fact that Malthus composed the original incomplete draft of
his famous first work before he had completely absorbed the spirit
of Classical Political Economy. As proof that his doctrine permits of
no other interpretation, it may be pointed out that, before Spencer
and Darwin, no one thought of looking on the struggle for existence
(in the modern sense of the expression) as a principle active within
human society. Darwinism first suggested the theories which regard
the struggle of individuals, races, nations, and classes as the basic
social element; and it was in Darwinism, which had originated in the
intellectual circle of liberal social theory, that people now found
weapons to fight the Liberalism they abhorred. In Darwin's
hypothesis, long regarded as irrefutable scientific fact, Marxism, 1
Racial Mysticism: and Nationalism found, as they believed, an
unshakable foundation for their teachings. Modern Imperialism
especially relies on the catchwords coined by popular science out of
Darwinism.

could no longer grasp the meaning of the liberal social philosophy.
31 7

CONFLI CT AND SOCIAL EVOLUT ION
The Darwinian - or more correctly, pseudo-Darwinian-social
theories have never realized the main difficulty involved in applying to
social relations their catchwords about the struggle for existence. In
Nature it is individuals who struggle for existence. It is exceptional
to find in Nature phenomena which could be interpreted as struggles
between animal groups. There are, of course, the fights between
groups of ants - though here we may be one day obliged to adopt
explanations very different from those hitherto accepted. 1 A social
theory that was founded on Darwinism would either come to the point
of declaring that the war of all against all was the natural and neces­
sary form of human intercourse, thus denying that any social bonds
were possible; or it would have, on the one hand, to show why peace
does and must reign within certain groups and yet, on the other, to
prove that the principle of peaceful union which leads to the forma­
tion of these associations is ineffective beyond the circle of the group,
so that the groups among themselves must struggle. This is precisely
the rock on which all non-liberal social theories founder. If one
recognizes a principle which results in the union of all Germans, all
Dolichocephalians or all Proletarians and forms a special nation,
race, or class out of individuals, then this principle cannot be proved
to be effective only within the collective groups. The anti-liberal
social theories skim over the problem by confining themselves to the
assumption that the solidarity of interests within the groups is so
self-evident as to be accepted without further discussion, and by
taking pains only to prove the existence of the conflict of interests
between groups and the necessity of conflict as the sole dynamic
force of historical development. But if war is to be the father of all
things, the fruitful source of historical progress, it is difficult to see
why its fruitful activity should be restricted within states, nations,
races, and classes. If Nature needs war, why not the war of all against
all, why merely the war of all groups against all groups? The only
theory which explains how peace is possible between individuals
and how society grows out of individuals is the liberal social theory
of the division of labour. But the acceptance of this theory makes it
impossible to believe the enmity of collective groups to be necessary.
If Brandenburghers and Hanoverians live in society peacefuiiy
side by side, why cannot Germans and Frenchmen do so too?
Sociological Darwinism is unable to explain the phenomenon of

CONFLICT AND COMPETITION
the rise of society. It is not a social theory, but 'a theory of
unsociability' . 1
A fact which clearly exposes the decay of sociological thought in
recent decades, is that people now begin to combat sociological
Darwinism by pointing to examples of mutual aid (symbiosis) which,
Biology has only lately discovered in the vegetable and animal
kingdoms. Kropotkin, a defiant antagonist of liberal social theory,
who never understood what he rejected and combated, found
among animals the rudiments of social ties and set these up in opposi­
tion to conflict, contrasting the beneficial principle ofmutual aid with
the harmful principle of war-to-the-knife.a Kammerer, a biologist
enslaved by the ideas of Marxist Socialism, demonstrated that in
addition to conflict the principle of aid dominates life in Nature. I
At this point Biology returns to its starting-point, Sociology. It hands
back the principle of divided labour given it by Sociology. It teaches
Sociology nothing new, nothing essential that had not been included
in the theory of the division of labour as defined by the despised
Classical Political Economy.

§3
Conflict and competition
The social theories which are based on natural law start from the
dogma that human beings are equal. Since all men are equal, they
are supposed to have a natural claim to be treated as members of
society with full rights, and, because everybody has a natural right to
live, it would be a violation of right to try to take his life. Thus are
formulated the postulates of the all-inclusiveness of society, of
equality within society, and of peace. Liberal theory, on the other
hand, deduces these principles from utility. To Liberalism the
concepts man and social man are the same. Society welcomes as
members all who can see the benefit of peace and social collaboration
in work. It is to the personal advantage of every individual that .he

should be treated as a citizen with equal rights. But the man who,
ignoring the advantages of peaceful collaboration, prefers to fight
and refuses to fit himself into the social order, must be fought like a
dangerous animal. It is necessary to take up this attitude against the
anti-social criminal and savage tribes. Liberalism can approve of
war only as a defence. For the rest it sees in war the anti-social
principle by which social co-operation is annihilated.
By confusing the fundamental difference between fighting and
competition, the anti-liberal social theories sought to discredit the
liberal principle of peace. In the original seRse of the word, 'fight'
means the conflict of men and animals in order to destroy each other.
Man's social life begins with the overcoming of instincts and con­
siderations which impel him to fight to the death. History shows us a
constant retr�at from conflict as a form of human relations. Fights
become less intense and less frequent. The defeated opponent is no
longer destroyed; if society can find a way of absorbin him, his life
is spared. Fighting itself is bound by rules and is thus somewhat

g

mitigated. Nevertheless war and revolution remain the instruments
of destruction and annihilation. For this reason Liberalism never
ceases to stress the fact that they are anti-social.
It is merely a metaphor to call competition competitive war, or
simply, war. The function of battle is destruction; of competition,
construction. Economic competition provides that production shall
be carried on in the most rational marner. Here, as everywhere else,
its task is the selection of the best. It is a fundamental principle of
social collaboration which cannot be thought out of the picture.
Even a socialist community could not exist without it in some form,
though it might be necessary to introduce it in the guise, say, of
examinations. The efficiency of a socialist order of life would depend
on its ability to make the competition sufficiently ruthless and keen
to be properly selective.
There are three points of comparison which serve to explain the
metaphorical use of the word 'fight' for competition. In the first place
it is clear that enmity and conflict of interests exist between the
opponents in a fight as they do between competitors. The hate which
a small shopkeeper feels for his immediate competitor may be no less
in degree than the hate which a Moslem inspired in a Montenegrin.
But the feelings responsible for men's actions have no bearing on the
social function of these actions. What the individual feels does not

320

NATIONAL WAR

matter as long as the limits set by the social order inhibit his actions.
The second point of comparison is found in the selective function
of both fighting and competition. To what extent fighting is capable
of making the best selection is open to question ; later we shall show
that many people ascribe anti-selective effects to wars and revolu­
tions. 1 But because they both fulfil a selective function one must not
forget that there is an essential difference between fighting and
competition.
The third point of comparison is sought in the consequences
which defeat lays on the vanquished. People say that the vanquished
are destroyed, not reflecting that they use the word destruction in the
one case only figuratively. Whoever is defeated in fight is killed; in
modern war, even where the surviving vanquished are spared, blood
flows. People say that in the competitive struggle, economic lives are
destroyed. This, however, merely means that those who succumb are
forced to seek in the structure ofthe social division oflabour a position
other than the one they would like to occupy. It does not by any
means signify that they are to starve. In the capitalist society there
is a place and bread for all. Its ability to expand provide� sustenance
for every worker. Permanent unemployment is not a feature of
free capitalism.
Fighting in the actual original sense of the word is anti-social. It
renders co-operation, which is the basic element of the social relation,
impossible among the fighters, and where the co-operation already
exists, destroys it. Competition is an element of social collaboration,
the ruling principle within the social body. Viewed sociologically,
fighting and competition are extreme contrasts.
The realization of this provides a criterion for judging all those
theories which regard social evolution as a fight between conflicting
groups. Class struggle, race conflicts, and national wars cannot be
the constructive principle. No edifice will ever rise from a foundation
of destruction and annihilation .

The most important medium for social co-operation is language.

help can one man communicate to another something at least of
what he is feeling. We need not discuss at this point the wider
significance of language in relation to thought and will: how it
conditions thought and will and how, without it, there could be no
thought but only instinct, no will but only impulse. 1 Thought also
is a social phenomenon; it is not the product of an isolated mind but
of the mutual stimulus of men who strive towards the same aims. The
work of the solitary thinker, brooding in retirement over problems
which few people trouble to consider, is talk too, is conversation with
the residue of thought which generations of mental labour have
deposited in language in everyday concepts, and in written tradition.
Thought is bound up with speech. The thinker's conceptual edifice
is built on the elements of language.
The human mind works only in language; it is by the Word that
it first breaks through from the obscurity of uncertainty and the
vagueness of instinct to such clarity as it can ever hope to attain.
Thinking and that which is thought cannot be detached from the
language to which they owe their origin. Some day we may get a
universal language, but certainly not by means of the method
employed by the inventors of Volapuk, Esperanto, and other similar

devices. The difficulties of a universal language and of the mutual
understanding of peoples are not to be solved by hatching out
identical combinations of syllables for the terms of every day life and
for use by those who speak without overmuch thinking. The untrans­
latable element in ideas, which vibrates in the words expressing them,
is what separates languages quite as much as the variety of sounds in
words which can be transposed intact. If everyone, all the world
over, used the same words for 'waiter' and 'doorstep' we should still
not have bridged the gap between languages and nations. But
suppose everything expressed in one language could be translated
into other languages without losing anything in the process, we should
then have achieved unity oflanguage, even though we had not found
identical sounds for the syllables. Different languages would then
be only different tongues, and our inability to translate a word
would no longer impede the passage of thought from nation to
nation.
Until that day comes - and it is possible that it never will come ­

NATIONAL WAR
living together with mixed languages, friction that may lead ' to
serious political antagonism. l Directly or indirectly, these disputes
are responsible for the modern 'hate' between nations, on which
Imperialism is based.
Imperialist theory simplifies its task when it limits itselfto proving
that conflicts between nations exist. To clinch its arguments it
would have to show also that there is a solidarity of interests within
the nations. The nationalist-imperialist doctrine made its appear­
ance as a reaction against the recumenical-solidarism of the Free
Trade doctrine. At its advent the cosmopolitan idea of world­
citizenship and the fraternity of the nations dominated men's minds.
All that seemed necessary, therefore, was to prove that there were
conflicting interests between the various nations. The fact that all
the arguments it used to prove the incompatibility of national
interests could with equal justification be used to prove the incom­
patibility of regional interests and finally even of the individual's
ersonal interests, was quite overlooked. If the Germans suffer from
consuming English cloth and Russian corn, the inhabitants of Berlin
must, presumably, suffer from consuming Bavarian beer and Rhine
wine. If it is not well to let the division of labour pass the frontiers of
the state, it would no doubt be best in the end to return to the self­
sufficiency of the closed domestic economy. The slogan 'Away with
foreign goods!' would lead us, if we accepted all its implications, to
abolish the division of labour altogether. For the principle that
makes the international division of labour seem advantageous is
precisely the principle which recommends division of labour in any
circumstances.
It is no accident, that of all nations the German people has least

p

sense of national cohesion, and that among all European nations it
was the last to understand the idea of a political union in which one
state comprises all members of the nation. The idea of national
union is a child of Liberalism, of free trade, and of laissez-faire. The
German nation, of which important parts are living as minorities in
areas settled by people of different tongues, was among the first to
learn the disadvantages of nationalistic oppression. This experience
led to a negative attitude to Liberalism. But without Liberalism, it
lacked the intellectual equipment necessary to overcome the regional
particularism of separate groups. It is no accident that the sentiment
1

323

CONFLICT AND SOCIAL EVOLUT I ON
of national cohesion is in no other people so strongly developed as
among the Anglo-Saxons, the traditional home of Liberalism.
Imperialists delude themselves fatally when they suppose it
possible to strengthen the cohesion of members of a nation by
rejecting cosmopolitanism. They overlook the fact that the basic
anti-social element of their doctrine must, iflogically applied, split up
every community.

§5
Racial war
Scientific knowledge of the innate qualities of man is still in its
infancy. We cannot really say any more about the inherited charac­
teristics of the individual than that some men are more gifted from
birth than others. Where the difference between good and bad is to
be sought We cannot say. Vie know that men differ in their physical
and psychic qualities. We know that certain families, breeds, and
groups of breeds reveal similar traits. We know that we are justified
in differentiating between races and in speaking of the different racial
qualities of individuals. But so far, attempts to find somatic charac­
teristics of racial relationships have had no result. At one time it was
thought that a racial characteristic had been discovered in the
cranial index, but now it is clear that those relations between the
cranial index .md the psychic and mental qualities of the individual
on which Lapouge's anthroposociological school based its system do
not exist. More recent measurements have shown that long-headed
men are not always blond, good, noble, and cultured, and that the
short:.headed are not always black, evil, common and uncultured.
Amongst the most long-headed races are the Australian aborigines,
the Eskimos, and the Kaffirs. Many of the greatest geniuses were
round-heads. Kant's cranial index was 88. 1 We have learnt that
changes in the cranial index very probably can take place without
racial mixture - as the result of the mode of life and geographical
environment. I

RACIAL WAR

It is impossible to condemn too emphatically the procedure of the
'race experts'. They set up criteria of race in an entirely uncritical
spirit. More anxious to coin catchwords than to advance knowledge,
they scoff at all the standards demanded by scientific thought. But
the critics of such dilettantism take their job too lightly in directing
their attention solely to the concrete form which individual writers
give their theories and to the content of their statements about
particular races, their physical characteristics and psychic qualities.
Though Gobineau and Chamberlain's arbitrary and contradictory
hypotheses are utterly without foundation and have been pooh­
poohed as empty chimeras, there still remains a germ of the race
theory which is independent of the specific differentiation between
noble and ignoble races.
In Gobineau's theory the race is a beginning; originating in a
special act of creation, it is fitted out with special qualities. 1 The
influence of environment is estimated to be low: mixture of races
creates bastards, in whom the good hereditary qualities of the nobler
races deteriorate or are lost. To contest the sociological importance
of the race theories, however, it will not suffice to prove that this view
is untenable, or to show that race is the outcome of an evolution that
has proceeded under the most varied influences. This objection
might be overruled by asserting that certain influences, operating
over a long period, have bred one race or several, with specially
favourable qualities, and that the members of these races had by
means of these advantages obtained so long a lead that members of
other races could not overtake them within a limited time. In its
most modern variations the race theory does, in fact, put forward
arguments of this kind. It is necessary to study this form of the race
theory and to ask how it stands in relation to the theory of social
co-operation which has here been developed.
We see at once that it contains nothing directly inimical to the
doctrine of the division of labour. The two are quite compatible.
It may be assumed that races do differ in intelligence and will power,
and that, this being so, they are very unequal in their ability to form
society, and further that the better races distinguish themselves
precisely by their special aptitude for strengthening social co-opera­
tion. This hypothesis throws light on various aspects of social
evolution not otherwise easily comprehensible. It enables us to
1 0ppenheimer, Die rossentheoretische Geschichtspilosophie, p. 1 10 et seq.

325

CONFLICT AND SOCIAL EVOLUTION
explain the development and regression of the social division of
labour and the flowering and decline of civilizations. We leave
it open whether the hypothesis itself and the hypothesis erected on it
are tenable. At the moment this does not concern us. We are solely
concerned to show that the race theory is easily compatible with
our theory of social co-operation.
When the race theory combats the natural law postulate of the
equality and equal rights of all men, it does not affect the free trade
argument of the liberal school. For Liberalism does not advocate the
liberty of the workers for reasons of natural law but because it regards
unfree labour - the failure to reward the labourer with the whole
produce economically imputed to his labour, and the divorce of his
income from the productivity of his labour - as being less pro­
ductive than free labour. In the race theory there are no arguments
to refute free trade theory as to the effects of the expanding social
division of labour. It may be admitted that the races differ in talent
and character and that there is no hope of ever seeing those difference
resolved. Still, free trade theory shows that even the more capable
races derive an advantage from associating with the less capable and
that social co-operation brings them the advantage of higher pro­
ductivity in the total labour process. 1
The race theory begins to conflict with the liberal social theory
at the point where it begins to preach the struggle between races.
But it has no better arguments to advance in this connection than
those of other militaristic social theories. The saying of Heraclitus
that war is the father of all things remains unproven dogma. It, too,
fails to demonstrate how the social structure could have grown out
of destruction and annihilation. Nay, the race theorists too - in
so far as they try to judge unbiased and not simply to follow their
sympathy for the ideology of militarism and conflict - have to
admit that war has to be condemned precisely from the point of
view of selection. Lapouge has pointed out that only in the case of
primitive peoples does war lead to the selection of the stronger and
more gifted, and that among civilized peoples it leads to a deteriora­
tion of the race bv unfavourable selection" The fit are more likelv
to be killed than the unfit, who are kept longer, if not altogethe ,

away from the front. Those who survive the war find their power to
produce healthy children impaired by the various injuries they have
received in the fight.
The results of the scientific study of races cannot in any way
refute the liberal theory of social development. Rather they confirm
it. The race theories of Gobineau and many others originated in the
resentment of a defeated military and noble caste against bourgeois
democracy and capitalist economy. For use in the daily politics of
modern Imperialism they have taken a form which re-embodies old
theories of violence and war. But their critical strictures are applic­
able only to the catchwords of the old natural law philosophy. They
are irrelevant so far as Liberalism is concerned. Even the race theory
cannot shake the assertion that civilization is a work of peaceful­
co-operation.

§r
The concept of class and of class conflict
AT any given moment the position of the individual in the social
n economy determines his relation to all other members of society.
He is related to them in respect of exchange, as giver and receiver, as
seller and buyer. His position in the society need not necessarily tie
him down to one and the same activity. One man may be simul­
taneously landlord, wage-earner, and capitalist; another simul­
taneously entrepreneur, employee, and landlord ; a third entre­
preneur capitalist, and landlord, etc. One may produce cheese and

:

baskets and hire himself out occasionally as a day labourer. But even
the situation of those who find themselves in approximately equal
positions differs according to the special circumstances in which they
appear on the market. Even as a buyer for his own consumption
every man is situated differently from others according to his special
neeDs. On the market there are always only single individuals. In
a free economy the market permits the emergence of individual
differences : it 'atomizes' as is sometimes said - usually somewhat
regretfully. Even Marx had to make a point of explaining that 'As
purchases and sales are made only between single individuals, it is
not admissible to look to them for relations between whole social
classes.' 1
Ifwe use the term class to denote all those in approximately equal
'
social positions, it is important to remember that the problem
whether classes have any special importance in social life is not thereby
solved. Schematization and classification per se have no cognitive

is taken was not in the first edition, published 1 867. Marx first inserted it in the French
version, published 1 873, whence Engels took it over into the fourth German edition.
Masaryk (Die philosopischen und soziologischen Grundlagen des Marxismus, Vienna 1899,
p. 299) justly remalks that the alteration is presumably connected with the change
Marx made in his theory in Vol. IJI of Dos Kopital. It can be regarded as a recantation
of the Marxist class theory. Significantly the third volume breaks off after a few sen­
tences in the chapter headed 'The Classes'. In treating the problem of class Marx
got only as far as setting up a dogma without proof, and no further.

value. The scientific significance of a concept arises out of its func­
tion in the theories to which it belongs ; outside the context of these
theories it is no more than an intellectual plaything. The usefulness
of the class theory is not proved when it is pointed out that since
men find themselves in different social positions, the existence of
social classes is undeniable. What matters is not the social position
of the individual but the significance of this position in the life of
society. It has long been recognized that the contrast between rich
and poor, like all economic contrasts, plays a great part in politics.
Equally well known is the historical importance of differences in
rank and caste, that is, differences in legal position, or inequality
before the Law. Classical Political Economy did not contest this.
But it undertook to show that all these contrasts derived from wrong
political institutions. According to Classical Political Economy,
correctly understood, the interests of individuals are never incom­
patibie. Belief in conflicts of interest, which formeriy was very
important, really sprang from ignorance of the natural laws of social
life. Once men recognized that, rightly understood, all interests were
identical, these issues would cease to influence political discussion.
But Classical Political Economy, which taught the solidarity of
interests, itself laid the foundation stone for a new theory of class
conflict. The mercantilists had placed goods in the centre of
economics, which in their eyes was a theory of objective wealth. It
was the great achievement of the Classics in this respect that beside
the goods they set up economic man. They thus prepared the way
for modern Economics which puts man and his subjective valuations
into the centre of its system. A system in which man and goods are
placed, so to speak, on an equal footing falls inevitably into two
parts, the one treating of the production of wealth, the other of its
distribution. The more Economics becomes a strict science, a
system of catallactics, the more this conception tends to recede. But
the idea of distribution remains for a time. And this gives rise in
turn to the idea of a division between the process of production and
that of distribution. The goods are first produced, then distributed.
However clear it is that. in the caoitalist economv. 'oroduction and
'distribution' are indis;olubly int�rconnected, this unhappy con­
ception tends to confuse the issue. 1
1 On t.he history of the concept of distribution, see Cannan, A History of the Theories
of Production and Distribution, p. 1 83 et seq.
329

CLASS INTE R E STS AND CLA S S WAR
Such misunderstandings are indeed inevitable as soon as this
term 'distribution' is adopted and the problem of imputation is
considered as a problem of distribution. For such a theory of
imputation or, to use a term corresponding more closely to the classic
setting of the problem, a theory of income, must distinguish between
the various categories of factors of production, though in fact the
same fundamental principle of value formation are to be applied to
all of them. 'Labour' is separated from 'Capital' and from 'Land'.
Nothing is easier in such a context, than to regard labourers,
capitalists, and landowners as separate classes, as Ricardo first did
in the preface to his Principles. The fact that the classic economists
do not split up 'profit' into its components parts, only increased this
tendency and gave us the picture of society divided into three great
classes.
But Ricardo goes still further. By showing how 'in different stages
of society' l the proportions of the total produce which will be
allotted to each of the three classes are different, he extends the class
conflict to dynamics. His successors follow him here. And it is here
that Marx steps in with the economic theory that he puts forward in
Das Kapital. In his earlier writings, especially in the introductory
words of the Communist Manifesto, Marx still conceives class and
class conflict in the old sense of a contrast in legal position and the
size of fortune. The link between the two notions is provided by a
view of modern industrial relations as the domination of capitalists
over workers. But even in Das Kapital Marx does not delimit precisely
the concept of class, although it is of fundamental importance for his
theory. He does not define what class is, but limits himself to enu­
merating the 'great classes' into which modern capitalist society is
divided.· Here he follows Ricardo's division, neglecting the fact that
for Ricardo the division of classes is only of importance for the theory
of catallactics.
The success of the Marxist theory of class and class conflicts has
been tremendous. To-day the marxian distinction of classes within
society and the theory of the irreconcilable conflict between these
classes is almost urtiversally accepted. Even those who desire, and
work for, peace between classes do not as a rule contest the view that
there are class contrasts and class struggles. But the concept of class

330

CONCEPT O F CLASS AND CLASS CONFLICT
remains as uncertain as before. For the followers of Marx, as for
Marx himself, the concept corruscates in all the colours of the rain­
bow.
If, following the system of Das Kapital, this concept is based on the
classical division of the factors of production, then a classification
that was invented only for purposes of the theory of exchange and is
only justifiable there, is transformed into the basis of general socio­
logical knowledge. The fact is overlooked that the assembling of the
factors of production into two, three or four large groups is merely a
problem of the arrangement of economic theory, and that it
can be valid within this context only. The classification of the
factors of production is not a classification of men or groups of
men, but of functions; the rationale of the division lies solely in
the purpose of the theory of catallactics
it is
intended
to serve. The separation of 'Land' for example, owes its special
position to the Classical theory of ground-rent. According to this
theory, land is that requisite of production which, under certain
assumptions, can yield a rent. Similarly, the position of capital as
the source of profit, and oflabour as the source of wages, is due to the
peculiarities of the classical system. In subsequent solutions of the
problem of distribution which divided the 'profit' of the classical
school into entrepreneur's profit and interest on capital, the grouping
of the factors of production was entirely different. In the modern
imputation theory on the contrary, the grouping of the factors of
production according to the scheme of the classical theory is no
longer of any importance. What was formerly called the problem of
distribution is now the problem of the formation of prices of goods of
higher orders. Only conservatism of scientific classification has
tended to retain the old terminology. A grouping more in accord­
ance with the spirit of imputation theory would have to proceed on
an entirely different basis - for example, the separation of static and
dynamic branches of income.
But - and this is the essential point - in no system is the basis for
the grouping of factors determined by their natural characteristics.
It is the failure to perceive this that constitutes the gravest error of the
theory of economic classes. This theory began by naively assuming
an inner relation (created by natural economic conditions) between
those factors of production which have been grouped together for
analytical reasons. It constructs a uniform land, which can be used
331

CLASS I NTERESTS AND CLASS WAR
for at least all kinds of agriculture, and a uniform labour, which
can work at anything. It makes a concession, an attempt to conform
to reality, when it distinguishes between land to be used agricul­
turally, land to be used for mining, and urban land, and when it
differentiates between skilled and unskilled labour. But this con­
cession does not improve matters. Skilled labour is just as much an
abstraction as 'labour' pure and simple, and agricultural land is just
as much an abstraction as 'land' pure and simple. And - what is
important here - they are abstractions which leave out just those
characteristics essential to sociological study. When dealing with the
peculiarities of price formation we may, in certain circumstances,
be permitted to make the contrast between the three groups: land,
capital, and labour. But this does not prove at all that such grouping
is permissible when we are dealing with a quite different problem.

§2
Estates and classes
The theory of the class war constantly confuses the notions of
Estate ('Stand') and class. 1 Estates were legal institutions, not
economically determined facts. Every man was born into an estate
and generally remained in it until he died. All through life one
possessed estate-membership, the quality of being a member of a
certain estate. One was master or serf, freeman or slave, lord of
the land or tied to it, patrician or plebeian, not because one occupied
a certain position in economic life, but because one belonged to a
certain estate. Admittedly the estates were in their origins an
economic institution, in the sense that, like every social order, they
1 Cunow (Die Marxsche Geschichts-,Gesellschafts-und Staatstheorie, Vol. 11,
Berlin 192 1, p. 6, et seq.) tried to protect Marx from the accusation that he has mixed
up the concepts class and ' Stand' ('Estate'). But his own remarks and the passages
he quotes from Marx and Engels show how justified is this accusation. Read, for
example, the first six paragraphs of the first part of the Communist Manifesto, headed
' Bourgeois and Proletarians' and you will be convinced that there at least the expres­
sions 'Stand' and class are used indiscriminately. We have already said that when,
later on in London, Marx became familiar with the Ricardian system, he separated
his concept class from the concept 'stand' and connected it with the three Factors of
Production of the Ricardian system. But he never developed this new concept of
class. Neither has Engels or any other Marxist tried to show what really welds the
competitors - for these are the people of whom the 'uniformity of incomes and of
sources of incomes' makes a conceptual unit - into a class inspired by the same special
interests.

332

ESTATES AND CLAS S E S
had arisen ultimately from the need to safeguard social co-operation.
But the social theory underlying this institution was fundamentally
different from the liberal theory, for human co-operation was
conceived only as a 'taking' by some and a 'giving' by others. That
the give and take could be mutual and all parties gain thereby was
utterly incomprehensible to such a theory. A later epoch, seeking to
justify the estate system which, in the light of the liberal ideas then
slowly dawning in the world, had begun to appear unsocial and also
unjust, based on a one-sided burdening of the lqwer orders, fabricated
an artificial reciprocity in the relationship : the higher orders gave the
lower protection, sustenance, the use of the land, and so on. But the
very existence of this doctrine reveals that the decay of the estate
ideology had already begun. Such ideas were alien to the institution
in its heyday, when the relationship was frankly one of violence, as
may be dearly seen in the first essential distinction drawn by estate
- the distinction between free and unfree. The reason why the
slave looked on slavery as natural, resigning himself to his lot instead
of continuing to rebel and run away as long as there was breath in
his body, was not that he believed slavery to be a just institution,
equally advantageous to master and slave, but simply that he did not
want to endanger his life by insubordination.
By stressing the historical role of slavery it has been sought to
refute the liberal view of subjection and of the institution of the
estate also. Slavery was said to mark an advance in civilization,
when men taken in battle were enslaved instead of being killed.
Without slavery a society dividing labour, in which trades are
separated from primary production, could not have developed until
all free soil had been disposed of; for everyone would have preferred
to be free master of his own land rather than a landless worker on
raw materials produced by others, let alone a propertyless labourer
on someone else's land. On this view slavery has a historical justifi­
cation, as higher civilization is inconceivable without the division of
labour which gives part of the population a life of leisure, freed from
common worries over daily bread. 1
It is only for those who study history with the eyes of the moralist
that the question of whether an historical institution can be justified
or not can arise at all. The fact that it has appeared in history shows
that forces were active to bring it about. The only question that can

labour of slaves and serfs, and it was a long time before it cast off all
trace of its origin and became what it is in the capitalist economy.
But it is a complete misunderstanding of the capitalist economy to
equate economically free labour for wages with the work done by
the unfree. One may draw sociological comparisons between the
two systems. For both involve division of labour and social co­
operation, and in this reveal common features. But sociological study
must not overlook the fact that the economic character of the two
systems is quite different. Analysis of the economic character of
free labour with arguments derived from the study of slave labour is

bound

to be worthless. The free worker receives in wages what is

economically imputed to his labour. The slave owner expends the
same amount - by providing for the sustenance of the slave and by
paying the slave dealer a price for the slave that corresponds to the
present value of the amounts by which the wages of free labour are or
would be higher than the slave's sustenance costs. The surplus of the
wages of labour over the workers' sustenance costs thus goes to the
man who transforms free men into slaves - to the slave hunter, not
to the slave dealer or the slave owner. These two do not derive any
specific income in the slave economy. It is clear, therefore, that any­
one who tries to support the exploitation theory by referring to
conditions of a slave economy completely misunderstands the
problem. l
In a society divided into estates all members of the estates who
lack complete rights before the law have one interest in common with

'Uber \Vert, Kapital, und Rente' in Schmoller's Jahrbuch, Vo!. XIX, p. 335 et seq.) 'is
unmistakable, and this is probably still true of the "sweater". In the normal relation­
ship between entrepreneur and worker there is no such exploitation, but rather an
economic dependence on the part of the worker, which undeniably influences the
distribution of the produce of labour. The propertyless worker must absolutely
procure "present goods" for himself; otherwise he dies. He can generally realize his
labour only by collaborating in the production of "future good s". But this is not the
decisive factor, for even though he produces, like the baker's labourer, a commodity
to be consumed on the day of its production, yet his share in the yield is conditioned
by the circumstances disadvantageous to him, that he cannot make an independent
use of his labour, but is forced to sell it against more or less sufficient means of lifct.
renouncing his claim to its product. These are trivial propositions, but I believe that
they will always have a convincing force for unprejudiced observers because of their
direct self-evidence.' One agrees with Bohm-Bawerk (Einige strittige Fragen der
Kapitalstheorie, Vienna and Leipzig 1900, p. I I Z) and Engels (Preface to the third
volume of Das Kapita/, p. xii) that in these ideas, which, by the way, only reproduce
the views dominant in German ' Popular Economics', is to be found a recognition dressed
up in careful words, of the socialist theory of exploitation. The economic fallacies
of the exploitation theory are nowhere exposed more clearly than in this attempt of
Lexis to find a basis for it.

335

CLASS INTERESTS AND C LASS WAR
other members : they struggle to improve the legal position of their
estate. All who are bound to the soil strive to have the burden of rent
lightened ; all slaves strive for freedom, that is, for a condition under
which they can use their labour for themselves. The community of
interest of all the members of an estate is stronger, the less the
individual is able to raise himself above the legal sphere of his estate.
It does not matter very much here that in some rare cases, especially
gifted individuals, aided by happy accidents, are able to rise into
higher estates. No mass movements are born of the unsatisfied wishes
and hopes ofisolated individuals. Desire to renew their own strength
rather than a wish to smother social discontent is what causes the
privileged estates to clear the way for the rise of the talented. Gifted
individuals who have been prevented from rising can become
dangerous only if their call to violent action finds an echo in wide
strata of discontented men.

§3
Class war
The settlement of particular conflicts between estates could not
remove the distinction between estates, as long as the idea of dividing
society in this way remained. Even when the oppressed shook off
the yoke, all differences in status were not abolished. Liberalism
alone could overcome the fundamental conflict of estates. It did so
by abolishing slavery - on the ground that free labour was more
productive than unfree - and by proclaiming freedom of movement
and choice of occupation as the fundamental desiderata of a rational
policy. Nothing exposes more clearly the inability of anti-liberalism
to grasp the historical significance of Liberalism than its attempt to
represent this achievement as the product of special group 'interests' .
In the struggle between estates all members of an estate stand
together because they have a common aim. However much their
interests otherwise diverge they meet on this one ground. They want
a better legal position for their estate.
Economic advantages
usually accompany this, for the reason why legal differences are
maintained between estates is precisely that they confer economic
advantages on some to the economic prejudice of others.
But the 'class' of the theory of the class-war is a different matter
336

CLASS WAR

altogether. The theory of irreconcilable class conflict is illogical
when it stops short at dividing society into three or four large classes.
�arried to its logical conclusions, the theory would have to go on
dissolving society into groups ofinterests till it reached groups whose
members fulfilled precisely the same function. It is not enough to
separate owners into landowners and capitalists. The differentiation
must proceed until it reaches such groups as cotton spinners who
manufacture the same count of yarn, or the manufacturers of black
chevreau leather, or the brewers oflight beer. Such groups have, it is
true, one common interest as against the mass of others : they are
vitally interested in the favourable sale of their products. But this
common interest is narrowly limited. In a free economy a single
branch of production cannot in the long run obtain more than an
average profit and cannot, on th,e other hand, work at a loss. The
common interest of members of a trade does not extend, therefore,
beyond the trend of the market within a limited space of time. For
the rest, competition, not immediate solidarity of interest, operates
between them. This competition is suspended by special interests
only when economic liberty is limited in some way. But if the scheme
is to retain its usefulness for the critique of the theory of the solidarity
of class interests, evidence must be produced that this competition is
suspended under a free economy. The class struggle theory cannot
be proved to be sound by a reference to the common interests of
landowners as being in conflict with the urban population on tariff
policy, or to the conflict between landowners and town dwellers on the
matter of political government. Liberal theory does not deny that
state interference in trade creates special interests, nor that by this
means particular groups can extract privileges for themselves. It
merely says that such special favours, when they are exceptional
privileges of small groups, lead to violent political conflict, to revolts
of the non-privileged many against the privileged few, which by
constantly disturbing the peace, hold up social development. It
explains further that where these special privileges constitute a
general rule, they injure everyone, for they take on the one hand
what they give on the other, and leave behind, as a permanent
result, only a general decline in the productivity oflabour.
In the long run the community of interests among the members of
a group and the contrast between their interests and the interests of
other groups arise always from limitations of the right of ownership,
337

CLASS INTERESTS AND CLASS WAR
of the freedom of trade, of the choice of occupation. Only in the
short run can they arise from the condition of the market as such.
But if among the groups whose members occupy the same position
in the economy there is no community of interest which would place
them in opposition to all other groups, there can certainly be no such
community within the larger groups whose members occupy not the
same but merely a siI]lilar position. If there is no community of
special interests between the cotton-spinners among themselves,
neither is there any within the cotton industry or between the
spinners and the machine makers. Between spinner and weaver,
machine maker and machine user, the direct contrast ofinterests is as
marked as it can possibly be. A community of interests exists only
where competition is ruled out, for example, between the owners of
land of a certain quality or situation.
The theory that the population is divided into three or four large
groups, each with a common interest, errs in regarding land owners
as a class with unitary interests. No special common interest unites
the owners of arable land, of forests, of vineyards, of mines, or of
urban real estate, unless it be that they defend the right of private
property in land. But that is not the special interest of the owners.
Whoever has recognized the significance of private ownership in the
means of production must, whether he possesses property or not,
advocate the principle in his own as well as the owner's interest.
Landowners have genuine special interests only where the liberty of
acquiring property and of trading has been limited.
There are no common interests among labourers either. Homo­
geneous labour is as non-existent as the universal worker. The work
of the spinner is different from the work of the miner and the work of
the doctor. The theorists of Socialism and of irreconcilable class
conflict talk as though there was some kind of abstract labour which
everyone was qualified to perform and as though skilled labour hardly
came into the question . In reality no such 'absolute' labour exists.
Nor is unskilled labour homogeneous. A scavenger is different from
a porter. Moreover the role of unskilled labour is much smaller,
considered purely numerically, than orthodox class theory assumes.
In deducing the laws of the theory of imputation we are justified in
speaking simply of 'land' and 'labour' . For from this point all goods
of the higher order are significant only as economic objects. The
reason for simplifying the infinite variety of goods of higher orders
338

CLASS WAR
into a few large groups is convenience in working out the theory
which is of course directed towards a definite aim. It is often com­
plained that economic theory works with abstractions; but precisely
those who make this complaint themselves forget that the concepts
'labour' and 'worker', 'capital' and 'capitalist', and so on, are
abstract; and do not hesitate to transplant the 'worker' of theoretical
Economics into a picture of what is supposed to be actual social life.
The members ofa class are competitors. If the number of workers
diminishes, and if the marginal productivity of labour grows accord­
ingly, wages rise, and with them the income and standard of living
of the worker. Trade unions cannot alter this. When they, who were
supposed to be called into being to fight the entrepreneurs, close their
membership like guilds, they implicitly recognize the fact.
Competition operates among the workers when they compete
for higher positions and for promotion to higher ranks.
Members of other classes can afford to remain indifferent as to
the precise persons who are numbered among the relative minority
which rises from the lower to the higher strata, so long as these are the
most capable. But for the workers themselves this is an important
matter. Each is in competition with the others. Of course each is
interested to see that every other foreman's job shall be occupied by
the most suitable man and the best. But each is anxious that that
one job which comes within his reach shall fall to him, even though he
is not the most suitable man for the job; and the advantage to him
outweighs the fraction of the general disadvantages which may
eventually also come his way.
The theory of the solidarity of the interests of all members of
society is the only theory which shows how society is possible; and if
it is dropped, the social unity dissolves not only into classes, but into
individuals confronting each other as opponents. Conflict between
individual interests is overcome in society but not in the class.
Society knows no components other than individuals. The class
united by a community of special interests does not exist; it is the
invention of a theory incompletely articulated. The more compli­
cated society is, and the further differentiation has prol!:ressed within
'
it, so much the more numerous are the groups of pe�ons similarly
placed within the social organism; though necessarily, the number of
members in each group diminishes as the number of groups increase.
The fact that the members of each group have certain immediate
339

CLASS INTERESTS AND CLASS WAR
interest in common does not, of itself, create universal equality of
interests between them. The equality of position makes them
competitors, not people with common aspirations. Nor can any
absolute community of interests arise from the incomplete similarity
between the positions of allied groups. As far as their positions are
similar, competition will operate between them.
The interests of all cotton mill owners may run parallel in certain
directions, but in so far as this is the case, the :tQore are they com­
petitors among themselves. In other respects only those owners of
mills who produce the same count of yarn will be in exactly parallel
positions. Here again to this extent they are in competition with each
other. In other respects however, the common interests are similar
over a much wider field ; they may comprise all workers in the cotton
industry, then, again, all cotton producers, including planters and
workers, or further, all industrialists of any kind, etc. : the grouping
varies perpetually according to the aim and interests to be pursued.
But complete similarity there is rare, and, where it does exist, it
leads not only to common interests vis-a-vis third parties but,
simultaneously, to competition between the parties within the group.
A theory which made all social development proceed from
class struggles would have to show that the position of each indi­
vidual in the social organism was unequivocally determined by his
class position, that is, by his membership of a certain class and the
relation of this class to other classes. The fact that in all political
struggles certain social groups are in conflict with each other is by
no means a proof of this theory. To be correct it must be capable of
demonstrating that the grouping is necessarily directed into a certain
path and cannot be influenced by ideologies which are independent
of the class position; that the way in which the smaller groups com­
bine to form larger groups, and these again form classes which divide
the whole of society, is not a way of compromises and alliances
formed for temporary co-operation but results frqm facts created by
social necessities, from an unequivocal community of interests.
Let us consider, for example, the different elements of which an
Agrarian Party is composed. In Austria, the wine-growers, the
cereal-growers, and the stock-breeders unite to form a common party.
But it certainly cannot be asserted that similarity of interest has
brought them together. For each of these three groups has different
interests. Their fusion with a view to securing certain protective

policies is a compromise between conflicting interests. Such a
compromise is, however, only possible on the basis of an ideology
that goes beyond the interests of the class. The class interest of each
of these three groups is opposed to that of the other groups. They
can meet only be setting certain special interests wholly or partly
aside, though they do this so as to fight all the more effectively for
other special interests.
It is the same with the workers, who are contrasted with the
owners of the means of production. The special interests of the
separate workers' groups are also not unitary. They have quite
different interests according to the knowledge and skill of their
members. It is certainly not in virtue of its class position that the
proletariat is that homogeneous class the socialist parties imagine it
to be. Only adherence to the socialist ideology, which obliges every
individual and every group to give up his or its special interests,

consists precisely in effecting compromises between these conflicts of
interest. 1
Coalitions and alliances between group interests, other than
existing coalitions and alliances, are always possible. And those
which actually exist depend on the ideology, not on the class position,
of the groups. Political aims, not identity of interests, is what deter­
mines the coherence of the group. The community of special
interests is always restricted to a narrow field and is obliterated or
counter-vailed by the conflict of other special interests, unless a
certain ideology makes the community of interests seem stronger than
the conflict of interests.
The community of class interests does not exist independently of
class consciousness, and class consciousness is not merely additional
to a community of special interests; it creates such a community.
The proletarians are not a special group within the framework of
modern society, whose attitude is unequivocally determined by their
class position. Individuals are brought together for common political
action by the socialist ideology; the unity of the proletariat comes,
not from its class position, but from the ideology of the class-war.
As a class the proletariat does not exist before Socialism: the socialist

idea first created it by combining certain individuals to attain
a certain political end. There is nothing in Socialism which makes
it especially appropriate to forwarding the real interests of the
proletarian classes.
In principle class ideology is no different from national ideology.
In fact there is no contrast between the interests of particular nations
and races. It is national ideology which first creates the belief in
special interests and turns nations into special groups which fight each
other. Nationalist ideology divides society vertically; the socialist
ideology divides society horizontally. In this sense the two are
mutually exclusive. Sometimes the one has the upper hand, some­
times the other. In Germany in 1 9 14. the nationalist ideology
shouldered the socialist ideology into the background - and
suddenly there was a nationalist united front. In 1 9 1 8 the socialist
triumphed over the nationalist.
In a free society no classes are separated by irreconcilably con­
trasted interests. Society is the solidarity of interests. The union of
special groups has always as its safe aim the destruction of this
cohesion. Its aim is anti-social. The special community ofproletarian
interests extends only so far as they pursue one aim - to break up
society. It is the same with the special community of interests which
is supposed to exist for a whole nation.
Because Marxian theory does not define its notion of class more
closely, people have been able to use it for the expression of the most
diverse ideas. When they define the decisive conflict as that between
owners and non-owners, or between urban and rural interests, or
between bourgeois, peasant, and worker; when they speak of the
interests of 'armament capital', of 'alcohol capital', of 'finance
capital' ; 1 when at one moment they talk about the Golden Inter­
national and in the next breath explain that Imperialism is due to the
conflicts of capital, it is easy to see that these are the merest catch­
words of the demagogue, devoid of any real sociological interest
Thus in its most fundamental contentions Marxism has never risen
above the level of a doctrine for the soap box orator.s
1 At which point people quite iJIogically overlook the fact that the wage-earner too
is interested in the prosperity of the branch of production and of the piant in which
he is engaged.

p. 53) in his unCl·itical Marx apology has to admit thst Marx and Engels in their political
writings speak not only of the three main classes but differentiate between a whole
series of minor and side classes.

FORMS OF CLASS WAR

§4
The forms of class war
The total national product is divided into wages, rent, interest,
and profits. All economic theory considers it definitely settled that
this division proceeds, not according to the extra-economic power
of the individual classes, but according to the importance which the
market imputes to individual factors of production. Classical
Political Economy and the modern theory of marginal value agree
in this. Even Marxian doctrine, which has borrowed its theory of
distribution from classical theory, agrees. By deducing in this way
the laws according to which the value of labour is determined, it, too,
sets up a theory of distribution in which economic elements alone
are decisive. The 'h1arxian theory of distribution seems to us full of
contradictions and absurdities. Nevertheless it is an attempt to find
a purely economic explanation for the way in which the prices of
the factors of production are formed. Later on, when Marx was
moved for political reasons to recognize the advantages of the trade
union movement, he did make certain slight concessions on this
point. But the fact that he stuck to his system of economics shows
that these were only concessions which left his fundamental views
untouched.
If we were to describe as a 'struggle' the effort of all pacties on the
market to get the best price obtainable, then we might say that there
is a constant war of each against each throughout economic life; but
not by any means that there is a class-war. The fight is not between
class and class but between individuals. When groups of competitors
come together for joint action, class does not confront Class, but group
opposes group. What a single workers' group has obtained for itself
does not benefit all workers ; the interests of the workers of different
branches of production are as conflicting as those of entrepreneurs
and workers. When it speaks of class war, socialist theory cannot
have in mind this opposition of the interests of buyers and sellers in
the market. 1 What it means by class war takes place outside economic
life, though as a result of economic motives. When it considers the
class war as being analogous to the war between estates it can only
refer to a political fight which takes place outside the market. After
1 See Marx's words quoted on p. 328.

343

CLASS I NT E R E STS AND C LASS WAR
all this was the only kind of conflict possible between masters and
slaves, landowners and serfs ; on the market they had no dealings
with each other.
But Marxism goes beyond this. It assumes it to be self-evident
that only the owners are interested in maintaining private ownership
in the means of production, that the proletarians have the contrary
interest, and that both know their interests and act accordingly. We
have already seen that this view is only acceptable if we are pre­
pared to swallow the Marxian theory whole. Private ownership in
the means of production serves equally the interests of owners and
non-owners. It is certainly by no means true that the members of the
two great classes into which according to Marxian theory society is
divided, are naturally conscious of their interest in the class struggle.
The Marxians had to work hard to awaken the class consciousness
'jf the worker�, that is, to make the workers support Marxian plans
for the socialization of property. What joins the workers for co-opera­
tive action against the bourgeois class is precisely the theory of irre­
concilable class conflict. Class consciousness, created by the ideology
of the class conflict, is the essence of the struggle, and not vice versa.
The idea created the class, not the class the idea.
The weapons of the class struggle are no more economic than its
origins. Strikes, sabotage, violent action and terrorism of every kind
are not economic means. They are destructive means, designed to
interrupt dle movement of economic life. They are weapons of war
which must inevitably lead to the destruction of society.

§s
Class war as a factor in social evolution
From the theory of the class-war, Marxians argue that the socialist
order of society is the inevitable future of the human race. In any
society based on private property, says Marxism, there must of
necessity be an irreconcilable conflict between the interests
of separate classes : exploiters oppose the exploited. This contrast of
interests, it is assumed, determines the historical position of the
classes; it prescribes the policy they must follow. Thus history
becomes a chain of class struggles, until finally, in the modern
proletariat, there appears a class which can free itself from class rule

only by abolishing all class conflicts and all exploitation generally.
The Marxist theory of class war has extended its influence far
beyond socialist circles. That the liberal theory of the solidarity of
the ultimate interests of all members of society has been thrust
into the background was, of course, not due to this theory only, but
also to the revival of imperialist and protectionist ideas. But as the
liberal idea lost its glamour, the fascinations of the Marxian promises
were bound to be more widely felt. For it has one thing in common
with the liberal theory which the other anti-liberal theories lack: it
affirms the possibility of social life. All other theories which deny
the solidarity of interests deny also by implications social life itself.
Whoever argues with the nationalists, the race dogmatists, and even
the protectionists, that the conflict of interests between nations and
races cannot be reconciled, denies the possibility of peaceful co-opera­
tion between nations and thereby the possibility of international
organization. Those who, with the implacable champions of peasant
or petty bourgeois interests, consider the unflinching pursuit of class
interests as the essence of politics, would be only logical if they were
to deny all advantages of social co-operation. Compared with these
theories, which necessarily lead to very pessimistic views of the future
of society, Socialism seems to be an optimistic doctrine. At least for
the desired coming social order, it claims the solidarity of the interests
of all members of society. The desire for a philosophy, which does
not altogether deny the advantages of social co-operation is so
intensive, that many people have been driven into the arms of
Socialism who would otherwise have avoided it altogether. The only
oasis they find in the desert of anti-liberal theories is Socialism.
But in their readiness to accept the Marxian dogmas, such people
overlook the fact that its promise of a classless future for society
rests entirely on the assertion, presented as irrefutable, that the
productivity of socialistically organized labour would be higher ­
indeed, limitless. The argument is well known: 'The possibility of
giving all members of society, by social production, an existence
which shall be not merely materially adequate, increasing in wealth
from day to day, but which shall guarantee them also the complete
freedom to develop and practice their physical and mental abilities this possibility now exists for the first time, but it exists'. 1 Private
ownership in the means of production is the Red Sea which bars our
1 Engels, Herrn Eugen Dahrings Umwiilzung der Wissenschaft, p. 305.

C L A S S I NT E R E S TS A N D C L A S S W A R
path to this Promised Land of general well-being. From being an
'evolutionary form of the forces of production' it became their
'chains'. l The liberation of the productive forces from the shackles
of capitalism is the 'sole presupposition to an uninterrupted develop­
ment at an ever-increasing pace of the productive forces and, thus,
to a practically unlimited increase in production itself" . 'As the
development of modem technique makes possible a sufficient, even
abundant, satisfaction of wants for all, on condition that production is
directed economically by and for the country, the class conflict now
appears, for the first time, not as a condition ofsocial development but
as the obstacle to its conscious and planned organization.

In the

light of this knowledge the class interest of the oppressed proletarians
is directed towards abolishing all class interests and setting up a
classless society. The old, apparently eternal law of the class struggle
practically necessitates by its own logic, by the interest of the last
and most numerous class - the proietariat - the abolition of aB
class contrasts and the creation of a society in which interests are
unitary and which .is humanly solidary' . a Ultimately, therefore, the
Marxian demonstration is this : Socialism must come, because the
socialist way of production is more rational than the capitalist. But
in all this the alleged superiority of socialist production is simply
taken for granted. Except for a few casual remarks no attempt to
prove anything is made.'
If one assumes that production under Socialism would be higher
than under any other system, how can one limit the assertion by
saying that it is true only under certain historical conditions and has
not always been so? Why must time ripen for Socialism? It would
be understandable if the Marxians were to explain why, before the
nineteenth century, people did not hit upon this happy idea or why
even ifit had been conceived earlier, it could not have been realized.
But why must a community, to attain Socialism, go through all the
stages of evolution, although it is already familiar with the idea of
Socialism? One can understand that 'a nation is not ripe for
Socialism as long as the majority of the masses oppose Socialism and
want to have nothing to do with Socialism'. But it is not easy to see

why 'one cannot say definitely' that the time is ripe 'when the
proletariat forms the majority of the nation and when the latter in
its majority manifests the will to Socialism'. 1 Is it not quite illogical,
to maintain that the World War has put back our evolution and thus
retarded the coming of the right moment for Socialism? 'Socialism,
that is, general well-being within modern civilization, becomes
possible only through the enormous development of the productive
forces brought about by Capitalism, through the enormous wealth
Capitalism has created and concentrated in the hands of the
capitalist class. A state which has wasted this wealth in senseless
policy, such as an unsuccessful war, offers no favourable opportunity
for the quickest spread of well-being amongst all classes'! But surely
those who believe that Socialism will multiply productivity should see
in the fact that war has impoverished us one re�on the more for
hastening its coming.
To this Marx answers : 'a social order never succumbs until all the
productive forces of which it is capable are developed, and new and
higher conditions of production never replace it until the old society
itself has conceived within its womb the material conditions of their
existence'. a But this answer assumes that what needs to be demon­
strated is proved already: that socialist production would be more
productive and that socialist production is a 'higher' one, that is, on
a higher stage of social development.

§6
The theory of the class war and the interpretation of history
The opinion that history leads to Socialism is almost universal
to-day. From Feudalism through Capitalism to Socialism, from the
rule of the aristocracy through the rule of the bourgeoisie to prole­
tarian democracy - thus, approximately, people conceive the
inevitable evolution. The gospel that Socialism is our inescapable
destiny is acclaimed by many with joy, accepted by others with
regret, doubted by only the courageous few. This scheme of evolu­
tion was known before Marx, but Marx developed it and made it
popular. Above all Marx managed to fit it into a philosophic system.

Of the great systems of German idealist philosophy only those of
Schelling and Hegel have had a direct and lasting influence on the
formation of the individual sciences. Out of Schelling's Natural
Philosophy grew a speculative school whose achievements, once so
much admired, have long been forgotten. Hegel's Philosophy of
History mesmerized the German historians of a whole generation.
People wrote Universal History, History of Philosophy, History of
Religion, History of Law, History of Art, History of Literature
according to the Hegelian scheme. These arbitrary and often
eccentric evolutionary hypotheses have also vanished. The dis­
respect into which the schools of Hegel and Schelling brought
philosophy led Natural Science to reject everything that went beyond
laboratory experiment and analysis, and caused the Moral Sciences
to reject everything except the collection and sifting of sources.
Science limited itself to mere facts and rejected all synthesis as
unscientific. The impulse to permeate science once more with the
philosophic spirit had, to come from elsewhere - from biology and
sociology.
Of all the creations of the Hegelian School only one was fated to
a longer lease of life - the Marxian Social Theory. But its place was
outside. scholarship. Marxian ideas have proved utterly useless as
guides to historical research. All attempts to write history according
to the Marxian scheme have failed lamentably. The historical works
of the orthodox Marxists, such as Kautsky and Mehring, made no
progress at all in original and exhaustive research. They produced
only expositions based on the researches of others, expositions whose
only original feature was an effort to see everything through Marxist
spectacles. But the influence of Marxist ideas extends far beyond the
circle of orthodox disciples. Many historians, by no means to be
classed politically as Marxian socialists, approach them closely in
their views on the philosophy of history. In their works the Marxian
influence is a disturbing element. The use of such indefinite expres­
sions as 'exploitation', 'the striving of capital for surplus value', and
'proletariat' dulls the vision that should be kept clear for the impartial

classes which has become general since the French Revolution.
People call the French Revolution and the movement it introduced
into the various states of Europe and America the emancipation of
the Third Estate and think that now the Fourth Estate must have its
turn. We may overlook here the fact that a view which regards the
victory of liberal ideas as a class triumph of the bourgeoisie and the
Free Trade Period as an epoch of the rule of the bourgeoisie, pre­
supposes that all elements of the socialist theory of society are already
proved. But another question immediately occurs to us. Must this
Fourth Estate, whose turn is now supposed to come, be sought in the
proletariat? Might not one look for it with equal or greater justice
in the peasantry? Marx, of course, could have no doubts on the
subject. In his view it was a settled thing that in agriculture big-scale
concerns would oust small-scale enterprises and the peasant make
way for the landless labourer of the latifundia. Now, when the theory
of the inability of medium and small-scale agricultural enterprise to
compete has long been buried, a problem arises which Marxism
cannot answer. The evolution which is going on before our eyes
would permit us to suppose that domination was passing into the
hands of the peasants rather than that of the proletarians. 1
But here, too, our decision must rest on our judgment of the
efficiency of the two social orders, the capitalist and the socialist.
If Capitalism is not the diabolical scheme shown in socialist carica­
ture, if Socialism is not the ideal order which socialists assert it to be,
then the whole doctrine collapses. The discussion always returns to
the same point - the fundamental question whether the socialist
order of society promises a higher productivity than Capitalism.

Summary
Race, nationality, citizenship, estate-rights : these things directly
affect action. It does not matter whether a party ideology unites all
those belonging to the same race or nation, the same state or estate.
The fact that races, nations, states or estates exist determines human
action even when there is no ideology to guide members of a group

A German's thought and actions are in­

fluenced by the kind of mind he has acquired as a member of the
German language community. Whether or not he is influenced by
nationalist party ideology is here unimportant. As a German he
thinks and acts differently from the Roumanian whose thought the
history of the Roumanian, and not the German, language determines.
The nationalist party ideology is a factor quite independent of
one's membership of any given nation. Various mutually contra­
dictory nationalist party ideologies can exist concurrently and fight
for the individual's soul; on the other hand there may be no sort of
nationalist party ideology in existence. A party ideology is always
something specially introduced from outside into the already estab­

lished membership ofa certain social group, and for which it thereafter
forms a special source of action. Mere living in a society does not
create party doctrine in one's mind. Party attitudes always arise
from a theory of what is and is not advantageous. Social life may,
under certain circumstances, predispose one to accept a certain
ideology, and occasionally party doctrines are so formed that they
specially attract members of a particular social group. But the
ideology must always be kept separate from the actual social and
natural being.
Social being itself is ideological in so far as society is a product of
human will, and so of human thought. The materialistic conception
of history errs profoundly when it regards social life as independent
of thought.
If the position of the individual in the co-operative organism of
economic life is considered to be his class position, then what we have
said above applies also to the class. But again, one has to differentiate
here, too, between the influences to which his class position exposes
the individual and the political ideologies which influence him. The
fact that he occupies his particular position in society has its influence
on the life of the bank clerk. Whether he deduces from this that he
ought to advocate the capitalist or the socialist policy depends on the
ideas which dominate him.
But if one conceives 'class' in the marxist sense, as a tripartite
division of society into capitalists, land owners, and workers, it loses
all definiteness. It becomes nothing more than a fiction to justify a
concrete party-political ideology. Thus the concepts Bourgeoisie,
Working Class, Proletariat are fictions, the cognitive value of which

depends on the theory in the service of which they are applied. This
theory is the Marxian doctrine that class conflict is irreconcilable. If
we consider this theory inadmissible, then no class differences and no
class conflicts in the Marxian sense exist. If we prove that, correctly
understood, the interests of all members of society are not in conflict,
we have shown not merely that the Marxian idea of a conflict of
interests is untenable: we have discarded as valueless the very con­
cept of class as it figures in socialist theory. For only within the
frantework of this theory has the attempt to classify society into
capitalists, landowners, and workers any meaning. Outside this
theory it is as purposeless as, for example, any attempt to lump
together all fair or all dark people - unless indeed we propose, with
certain race theorists, to give special importance to the colour of the
hair, whether as an external characteristic or as a constitutive element.
The position of the individual in th:e division of labour influences
his whole way of living, his thought, and his attitude towards the
world. This is true in some respects also of the differences in the
situations which individuals occupy in social production. Entre­
preneurs and workers think differently because the habits of their
daily work give them different points of view. The entrepreneur
always has in mind the large and the whole, the worker only the near
and the small. 1 The first learns to think and act on a large scale, the
other remains stuck in the groove ofsmall preoccupations. These facts
are certainly of importance in a knowledge of social conditions, but
it does not follow that to introduce the concept of the class in the
sense of socialist theory would serve any useful purpose. For these
differences do not derive simply and solely from differences of
position in the process of production. The small entrepreneur's way
of thinking is nearer to that of the worker than to that of the large­
scale entrepreneur; the salaried manager of large undertakings is
more closely allied to the entrepreneur than to the worker. The
difference between poor and rich is, in many respects, more helpful to
our understanding of the social conditions we are studying than the
difference between worker and entrepreneur. The level of income,
rather than the individual's relation� to the factors of production,
determines a man's standard of life. His position as producer becomes
important only in so far as it affects the grading of his income.

§I
Thought and being

T was said by Feuerbach : 'thought proceeds from being, but not
I being from thought'. 1 This remark, which was intended to express
merely the renunciation ofHegelian Idealism, becomes in the famous
aphorism, 'Man is what he eats' ( 'Der Mensch ist was er isst') I, the
watchword of Materialism, as represented by BUchner and Mole­
schott. Vogt stiffened the materialist thesis by defending the state­
ment 'that thoughts stand in about the same relation to the brain as
the gall to the liver or urine to the kidneys'. a The same naive
materialism, which, ignoring all the difficulties, attempts to solve the
basic problem of philosophy simply and completely by referring
everything concerned with the mind to a physical phenomenon, is
revealed also in the economic conception of history of Marx and
Engels. The title 'Materialist Conception of History' is true to the
nature of the theory; it emphasizes, in the striking manner intended
by its founders, the epistemological homogeneity between their
belief and the materialism of their time.'
According to the materialist conception of history thought
depends on social being. This doctrine has two different versions
fundamentally contradictory to each other. The one explains
thought as a simple and direct development of the economic environ­
ment, of the conditions of production, under which men live.
According to this version there is no history of science and no history
of the individual sciences as independent evolutionary sequences

THOUGHT AND BEING
because the setting of problems and their solutions do not represent
a progressive intellectual process, but merely reflect the momentary
conditions of production. Descartes, says Marx, regarded the
animal as a machine, because he 'sees with the eyes of the manufac­
turing period, as distinguished from the eyes of the Middle Ages,
when the animal was regarded as the assistant of man - a position
assigned to it also at a later date by Herr von HaIler in his Restaura­
tion der Staatswissenschaft.' 1 In such a passage it is clear that the
conditions of production are regarded as facts independent of human
thought. They 'correspond' in turn to a 'definite stage of develop­
ment' in the 'material productive forces'" or, what is only another
way of putting the same thing, to 'a definite stage in the develop­
ment of the means of production and of transport'.1 The productive
forces, the means of work, 'result in' a definite order of society.'
'Technology reveals the active conduct of man towards nature, the
direct productive process of his lite, and consequently his social
conditions of life and the spiritual ideas which arise from them'.'
It never seems to have occurred to Marx that the productive forces
are themselves a product of human thought, so that one merely
moves in a circle when one tries to derive thought from them. He
was completely bewitched by the word-fetish, 'material production'.
Material, materialistic, and materialism were the fashionable
philosophic catch-words in his time, and he could not escape their
influence. He felt that his foremost task as a philosopher was to
remove the 'deficiencies of the abstract natural-science materialism
which exclude the historical process' ; those deficiencies which he
thought he could perceive 'in the abstract and ideological theories
of its spokesmen, as soon as they venture beyond their special sphere'.
And that is why he called his procedure 'the only materialistic,
hence the only scientific method' "
According to the second version of the materialist conception of
history, class interest determines thought. Marx says of Locke that
he 'represented the new bourgeoisie in all its forms : the industrialists
versus the working classes and paupers, the merchants versus the

old-fashioned usurers, high finance versus state debtors, and in one
of his own works he even demonstrated the bourgeois intelligence to
be the normal human intellect'. 1 For Mehring, the most prolific of
the Marxian historiarts, Schopenhauer is 'the philosopher of the
terrified philistines . . . in his sneaking, selfish, and slandering way
the spiritual image of the bourgeoisie which, frightened by the clash
of arms, trembling like the aspen, retired to live on its revenues and
foreswore the ideals of its epoch like the plague'. 2 In Nietzsche he
sees 'the philosopher of the Upper Bourgeoisie'. a
His judgments in economics represent this point of view most
clearly. Marx was the first to divide economists into bourgeois and
proletarian, a division which etatism afterwards made its own. Held
explains Ricardo's theory of rent as 'dictated simply by the hate of
the moneyed capitalists against the landed proprietors', and thinks
that Ricardo's whole theory of value can only be looked upon 'as
the attempt to justify, under the semblance of an endeavour to secure
natural rights, the domination and profits of Capitalism'.' The best
way to disprove this view is to point out the obvious fact that Marx's
economic theory is nothing more than a product of the Ricardo
school. All its essential elements are taken from the Ricardian system,
from which it derives also the methodological principle of the separa­
tion of theory and politics and the exclusion of the ethical point of
view: Politically, classical economics was employed both for
defending and for attacking Capitalism, for advocating as well as for
rejecting Socialism.
Marxism makes use of the same method with regard to modern
subjective economics. Unable to oppose it by a single word of
reasonable criticism, the marxian tries to dispose of it by denouncing
it as 'bourgeois economics' " To show that subjective economics is

as at most a joke. But the first part of Marx's Characterisation of Locke is no less un­
tenable than the second.

SOCIALISM

not 'capitalist apologetics' it should be sufficient, surely, to point
out that there are socialists who stand firmly by the theory of sub­
jective value. 1 The evolution of economics is a process of the mind,
independent of the supposed class interests of economists, and has
nothing to do with supporting or condemning any particular social
institutions. Every scientific theory can be misused for political
purpose ; the politician does not need to construct a theory to support
the aims he happens to pursue. 2 The ideas of modern Socialism have
not sprung from proletarian brains. They were originated by intel­
lectuals, sons of the bourgeoisie, not of wage-earners. a Socialism has
captured not only the working class; it has supporters, open and
secret, even amongst the propertied classes too.

§2
Science and Socialism
Abstract thought is independent of the wishes which move the
thinker and of the aims for which he strives. ' Only this independence
qualifies it as thought. Wishes and purposes regulate action. When
it is said that economic life influences thought the facts are reversed.
Economy as rational action is dependent on thought, not thought on
economy.
1 See Bernard Shaw, for example. Fabian Essays ( 1 889), p. 16 et seq. In the same
way, in sociology and political science, natural law and contract theory have served
both to advocate and fight Absolutism.
a If one wants to credit the materialist conception of history with having stressed
the fact that social relations are dependent on the natural conditions of life and pro­
duction, one must remember that this can appear as a special merit only in contrast
to the excesses of the Hegelian historians and philosophers of history. The liberal
philosophy of society and history and the writing of history since the end of the XVlIIth
Century (even the German, see Below, Die Deulsche Geschichtsschreibung von den
BeJreiungskriegen his IlU unseren Tagen, Leipzig 19 16, p. U4 et leq.) were beforehand
with this 'knowledge.
8 Of the chief representatives of French and Italian Syndicalism, Sombart says
(Sollialismus und solliaZe Bewegung, 7th Edition, Jena 1919, p. I I O): 'SO far as I know
them personally - amiable, fine, educated people. Cultured people with clean linen,
good manners and elegant wives, whom one meets as gladly as one's own kind of
people, and who certainly do not look as if they represented a movement which turns
above all against the increasingly bourgeois nature of Socialism and wants to help the
wealed fist, the genuine and true only-manual-workers to their rights. ' And De Man
says (Zur Psychologie des Sozialismus, p. 16 et seq): 'If one accepted the misleading
Marxist expression which connects every social ideology with a definite class attach­
ment, one would have to say that Socialism as a doctrine, even Marxism, is of bourgeois
origin.'

the wish is the father ofJaith.

C O N C E PT I ON O F H I S T O R Y
Even if it were wished to admit that thought is determined by
class-interest, it could only be done by considering recognized class
interests. But the I;ecognition of class interest is already a result of
thought. Whether such thought shows that special class interests
exist or that the interests of all classes in society harmonize, the
process of thought itself has taken place before the idea of class
influenced thought.
For proletarian thought, it is true, Marxism assumes a truth and
eternal value, free of all limitations of class interest. Though itself
admittedly a class, the proletariat must, transcending class interests,
guard the interests of humanity by abolishing the division of society
into classes. In the same way, proletarian thought contains in place
of the relativity of class-determined thought, the absolute truth
content of the pure science which will come to fruition in the future
socialist society. In other words, Marxism alone is science. What
preceded Marx historically, may be reckoned the pre-history of
science. Marxism gives philosophers before Hegel about the same
place which Christianity gives to the prophets, and grants Hegel the
same position which Christianity assigns to the Baptist in relation to
the Redeemer. Since the appearance of Marx, however, all truth is
with the Marxist, and everything else is lies, deception, and capitalist
apologetics.
This is a very simple and clear philosophy, and in the hands of
Marx's successors it becomes still simpler and clearer. To them
science and Marxian Socialism are identical. Science is the exegesis
of the words of Marx and Engels. ProofS are demonstrated by the
quotation and interpretation of these words. The protagonists
exchange accusations of ignorance of the 'Writ' . Thus a real cult of
the proletariat arises. Engels says : 'Only in the working class does
the German theoretic mind persist unstunted. Here it is not to be
exterminated. Here no regard is paid to career, profit-making,
gracious patronage from above. On the contrary, the more regard­
lessly and disinterestedly science proceeds the more it finds itself in
unison with the workers' interests and strivings' . l According to
Tonnies 'only the proletariat, i.e. its literary spokesmen and leaders',
subscribe, 'on principle, to the scientific view and all its consequences'.·

PSYCHOLOG I CAL PRESU PPOSIT I ONS
To reveal these presumptuous assertions in their proper light we
have only to recall the socialist attitude towards all scientific achieve­
ments during recent decades. When about a quarter of a century
ago, a number of Marxian writers tried to cleanse the party doctrine
of its grossest errors, a heresy hunt was instituted to preserve the
purity of the system. Revisionism succumbed to Orthodoxy. Within
Marxism there is no place for free thought.

§3
The psychological presuppositions of Socialism
According to Marxism, the proletariat in capitalist society
necessarily think socialistically. But why is this the case? It is easy
to see why the socialist idea could not arise before there was large
scale enterprise in industry, transport, and rrdning. As long as one
could look forward to redistributing the actual physical property of
the wealthy, it occurred to no one to devise any other way of securing
equality of income. Only when the development of the division of
labour had created large scale enterprise, unmistakably indivisible,
did it become necessary to invoke the socialistic way of achieving
equality. But although this explains why in the capitalist system
there can no longer be any question of 'dividing up', it by no means
explains why the policy of the proletariat must be Socialism.
In our day we take it for granted that the workman must think
and act socialistically. But we arrive at this conclusion only by
assuming that the socialist order of society is either the form of social
life most advantageous to the proletariat or, at least, that the prole­
tariat thinks it so. The first alternative has already been discussed in
these pages. In view of the undoubted fact that Socialism, though it
counts numerous supporters in other classes, is most wide spread
amongst the workers, there remains only the question why the
worker, because of the position he occupies, tends to be the more
receptive to the socialist ideology.
The demagogic toadyism of the socialist parties praises the worker
of modern Capitalism as a being distinguished by every excellency of
mind and character. A sober and less biased study might perhaps
arrive at a very different opinion. But this kind of inquiry may safely
be left to the party hacks of the various movements. For knowledge
of social conditions in general and the sociology of the party system in
35 7

CONCEPTION OF HISTORY
particular it is quite valueless. Our problem is simply to discover
why the worker's position in production should incline him to the
view that the socialist method of production is not only possible in
principle, but that it would be more rational than the capitalist
method.
The answer is not difficult. The workman in the large or medium
scale capitalist enterprise sees and knows nothing of the connections
uniting the individual parts of the work to the economic system as a
whole. His horizon as worker and producer does not extend beyond
the process which is his task. He holds that he alone is a productive
member of society, and thinks that everyone, engineer and overseer
equally well as entrepreneur, who does not, like himself, stand at the
machine or carry loads, is a parasite. Even the bank clerk believes
that he alone is actively productive in banking, that he earns the
profit of the undertaking, and that the manager who concludes
transactions is a superfluity, easily replaceable without loss. Now
from where he stands, the worker cannot see how things hang to­
gether. He might find out by means of hard thinking and the aid of
books, never from the facts of his own working environment. Just as
the average man can only conclude from the facts of daily experience
that the earth stands still and the sun moves from east to west, so the
worker, judging by his own experience can never arrive at a true
knowledge of the nature and functioning of economic life.
But when the socialist ideology comes to this economically
ignorant man and shouts :
Working man, awake, awake !
Of thy strength full measure take,
All the wheels must needs stand still
If thy strong arm so doth will,

(Herwegh)

is it any wonder if, dizzy with dreams of power, he follows this invita­
tion? Socialism is the expression of the principle of violence crying
from the workers' soul, just as Imperialism is the principle ofviole.nce
speaking from the soul of the official and the soldier.
The masses incline towards Socialism, not because it really tends
to their interests but because they believe that it does so.

CHAPTER J
THE

PROBLEM

§I
The Marxian theory of concentration

ARX seeks to establish an economic foundation for the thesis
Mthat the evolution towards Socialism is inevitable, by demon­
strating the progressive concentration of capital. Capitalism
has succeeded in depriving the worker of private ownership
in the means of production; it has consummated the 'expro­
priation of the direct producers' . As soon as this process
is completed 'the further socialization of labour and the further
transformation of land and other agents into socially exploited
and therefore collective means of production, together with the
ensuing expropriation of private owners, assume a new form. That
which is now to be expropriated is no longer the worker labour­
ing independently but the capitalist exploiting the worker. This
expropriation is carried out by the play of the inherent forces of
capitalist production itself; by the centralization of capital, each
individual capitalist deals the death-blow to a number of others'.
Hand in hand with this goes the socialization of production. The
number of the 'capitalist magnates' is continually decreasing. 'The
centralization of the means of production and the socialization of
labour reach a point where they become incompatible with their
capitalist framework. They burst it. The last hour of capitalist
private property has arrived. The expropriators are expropriated.'
This is the 'expropriation of the few usurpers by the mass of the
people', through the 'transformation of capitalist ownership, which
actually rests already on social production, into social ownership',
a process much less 'lengthy, hard, and difficult' than was, in its own
time, the process that transformed the private ownership of indi-

Marx gives a dialectical turn to his contentions. 'Capitalist
private ownership is the first negation of the individual private

36 1

THE PR O B L E M
ownership created by the workers' toil. But, with the inevitability of
a natural process, capitalist production brings forth its own negation.
It is the negation of the negation. This does not re-establish private
ownership, but only individual ownership based on the achieve­
ments of the capitalist era: co-operation and the collective owner­
ship of land and of the means or production produced by labour.' 1
Strip these statements of the dialectic accessories and there remains
the fact that the concentration of establishments, enterprises, and
fortunes is inevitable. (Marx does not distinguish between these
three and obviously regards th em as identical. ) This concentration
would eventually lead to Socialism, as the world, once it was trans­
formed into one single gigantic enterprise, could be taken over by
society with perfect ease; but before that stage has been reached, the
result will have been achieved by 'the revolt of the ever-expanding
working class which has been schooled, united, and organized by the
very mechanism of the capitalist production.'1
To Kautsky it is clear that' ' capitalist production tends to unite
the means of production, which have become the monopoly of the
capitalist class, into fewer and fewer hands. This evolution finally
makes all the means of production of a nation, indeed of the whole
world economy, the private property of a single individual or
company, which disposes of them arbitrarily. The whole economy
will be drawn together into one colossal undertaking, in which every­
thing has to serve one master. In capitalist society private ownership
in the means of production ends with all except one person being
propertyless. It thus leads to its own abolition, to the lack of property
by all and to the enslavement of all'. This is a condition towards
which we are rapidly advancing 'more rapidly than most people
believe'. Of course, we are told, the matter will not go so far. 'For
the mere approach to this condition must increase the sufferings,
conflicts, and contradictions in society to such an extent, that they
become intolerable and society bursts its bounds and falls to pieces'
unless evolution has previously been given a different direction.'
I t should be observed that, according to this view , the transition from
'High' Capitalism to Socialism is to be effected only by the deliberate
action of the Masses. The Masses believe that certain evils are to be

MAR X I A N T H E O R Y O F C O N C E N T R AT I O N
ascribed to private ownership in the means of production. They
believe that socialist production is likely to improve their condition.
It is therefore a theoretical insight which guides them. According to
the materialist conception of history, howevt;r, this theory must
itself be the inevitable result of a certain organization of production.
Here we observe once more how Marxism moves in a circle when it
tries to demonstrate its propositions. A certain condition must arise
because evolution leads to it; evolution leads there because thought
demands it ; but thought is determined by being. This being,
however, can be nothing more than that of the existing social condi­
tion. From the thinking determined by the existing condition the
necessity of another condition follows.
There are two objections against which this whole chain of
reasoning has no defence. It is unable to refute the contention of
anyone who, though arguing on the same lines, regards thought as the
cause, and society as that which is caused. And it has similarly no
reply to the objection that future conditions may very well be mis­
conceived, and that that which now seems so desirable may prove to
be less tolerable than existing conditions. This, however, re-opens
discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of types of societies,
those existing and those sketched out by would-be reformers. But
this is the very discussion which Marxism desired to suppress.
Let no one suppose that the Marxian doctrine of the concentra­
tion of capital can be verified by the simple method of consulting the
statistics of establishments, incomes, and fortunes. The statistics of
incomes and fortunes utterly contradict it. This can be definitely
asserted in spite of all the imperfections of present statistical methods
and all the difficulties which fluctuations in the value of money place
in the way of using the material. With equal confidence one can say
that the counterpart of the theory of concentration, the much dis­
cussed theory of increasing poverty - in which even orthodox
marxists can hardly continue to believe - is incompatible with the
results of statistical investigation . 1 The statistics of agricultural
holdings also contradict the Marxian assumptions. Those giving the
number of the establishments in industry, mining and transport
appear to confirm it. But figures that indicate a particular evolution
during a limited period cannot be conclusive. The development in
1 Wolf, Sozialismus und kapitalistische Gesellschaftsordnung, Stuttgart 189�, p. 149
et seq.

THE PROBLEM
this brief span might run contrary to the long term trend. We shall
do better, therefore, to leave statistics on both sides, both for and
against. For it must not be forgotten that there is a theory underlying
every statistical demonstration. Figures alone prove or disprove
nothing. Only the conclusions drawn from the collected material
can do this. And these are theoretical.

§2
The theory of anti-monopolistic policy
The theory of monopoly goes deeper than the Marxian theory of
concentration. According to it, free competition, the life blood of a
society based on private ownership in the means of production, is
weakened by the steady growth of monopoly. The disadvantages
bred within the economy by the unlimited rule of private monopolies
are, however, so great that society has no choice but to transform
private monopoly by socialization into state ownership. However
great an evil Socialism might be, it would be less harmful than
private monopoly. Should it prove impossible to counteract the
tendency towards monopoly in ever widening fields of production,
then private ownership in the means of production is already
doomed. 1
It is clear that this doctrine calls for a searching investigation :
first, as to whether evolution is really in the direction of monopoly
control, and secondly as to what are the economic effects of such
monopoly. Here one has to proceed with special care. The time at
which this doctrine was first expounded was generally not favourable
to the theoretical study ofsuch problems. The emotional judgment of
appearances rather than the cool examination of the essence of
things was the order of the day. Even the arguments of such an
outstanding economist as J. B. Clark are imbued with the popular
hatred of the trusts. Utterances typical of contemporary politicians
are to be found in the report ofthe German Socialization Commission
of February 15th, 1 9 1 9, where it was affirmed as 'indisputable' that

THE

11

CO NCENTRATI O N

OF

ESTABLI SHMENTS

§I
The concentration of establishments as the complement of the division of labour
HE concentration of establishments comes automatically with the

Tdivision of labour.

In the shoemaker's workshop the production
offootwear, formerly carried on in each individual household, is united
in one single establishment. The shoemaking village, the shoe­
manufactory become the manufacturing centre for a large area. The
shoe factory that is organized for the mass-production of footwear
represents a still wider union of establishments, and the basic
principle of its internal organization is on the one side, division of
labour, and, on the other side, concentration of similar work in
special departments. In short, the more the work is split up, the
more must similar labour processes be concentrated.
Neither from the results of the census undertaken in various
countries to verify the doctrine of the concentration of productive
units, nor from other statistical evidence of changes in the number of
establishments, can we learn all there is to be known about them.
For what appears in these enumerations as a unit is always, in a
certain sense, a unit of business, not a unit of production. Only in
certain cases do these investigations count separately works which,
whilst united in locality, are conducted separately inside a single
enterprise. The conception of the establishment and its evolution
has to be elaborated from a point of view other than that which lies
at the basis of trade statistics.
The higher productivity of the division of labour results, above
all, from the specialization of processes which it makes possible. The
more often a process has to be repeated the more does it pay to install
a specially adapted tool. The splitting up oflabour goes farther than
the specialization of occupations, or at least than the specialization
of enterprises. In the shoe factory shoes are produced by various
366

S I Z E I N P R I MA R Y P R O D U C T I O N
part processes. It is quite conceivable that each part process might
take place in a special establishment and in a special enterprise. In
fact, there are factories which make only .parts of shoes and supply
them to the shoe factories. Nevertheless, we usually consider as one
productive unit the sum of part processes combined in a single shoe
factory which itself produces all the component parts of shoes. If to
the shoe factory is joined also a leather factory or a department for
producing the boxes in which the shoes are packed, we speak of the
union of several productive units for a common enterprise. This is a
purely historical distinction which neither the technical circum­
stances of production nor the peculiarities of business enterprise
suffice by themselves to explain.
When we regard as an establishment that totality of process
involved in economic activity which businessmen regard as a unity,
we must remember that this unit is by no means an indivisible thing.
Each productive unit is itself composed of technical processes already
horizontally and vertically combined. The concept of an establish­
ment, therefore, is economic, not technical. Its de]jmitation in
individual cases is determined by economic, not by technical,
considerations.
The size of the productive unit is determined by the complemen­
tary quality of the factors of production. The aim is the optimal
combination of these factors, i.e. that combination by which the
greatest return can be produced economically. Economic develop­
ment drives industry to ever greater division of labour, involving at
once an increase in the size and a limiting of the scope of the unit of
production. The actual size of the unit is the result of the interaction
of these two forces.

§2
The optimal size of establi.shments in primary production and in transport
The Law of Proportionaiity in combining the factors of produc­
tion was first formulated in connection with agricultural production,
as the Law of Diminishing Returns. For a long time its general
character was misunderstood, and it was regarded as a law of
agricultural technique. It was contrasted with a Law of Increasing
36 7

CONCENTRATION OF ESTABL ISHMENTS
Returns, which was thought to be valid for industrial production.
These errors have since been corrected. 1
The Law of the Optimal Combination of the factors of production
indicates the most profitable size of the establishment. Net profit is
greater according to the degree to which its size permits all factors of
production to be employed without residue. In this way alone is to be
estimated the superiority which the size of one particular establish­
ment gives it over another establishment - at the given level of pro­
ductive technique. It was a mistake to think that enlargement of the
industrial establishment must always lead to an economy of costs, a
mistake of which Mane and his school have been guilty, although
occasional remarks betray the fact that he recognized the true state
of affairs. For here, too, there is a limit beyond which enlargement of
the establishment does not result in a more economical application
of the factors of production. In pri_'lciple, the same may be said of
agriculture and mining; the concrete data only differ. It is merely
certain peculiarities of the conditions of agricultural production which
cause us to regard the Law of Diminishing Returns as primarily
affecting land.
The concentration of establishments is primarily concentration
in space. As the land suitable to agriculture and forestry extends in
space, every effort to enlarge the establishment increases the dif­
ficulties that spring from distance. Thus an upper limit is set for the
size of the agricultural unit of exploitation. Because agriculture and
forestry extend in space it is possible to concentrate the establish­
ment only up to a definite point. It is superfluous to enter into the
question - often raised in discussion of this problen' - whether large
or sman scale production is the more economical in agriculture.
This has nothing to do with the Law of the Concentration of Estab­
lishments. Even supposing large scale production to be superior,
one cannot deny that there could be no question of a Law of the
Concentration of Establishments in agriculture or forestry. The fact
that land is owned on a large scale does not mean that it is worked on
a large scale. The great estates are always composed of numerous

farms.
This appears even more clearly in a different branch of primary

production, mining. Mining enterprise is tied to the place where the
ore is found. The establishments are as large as these separate places
permit. They can be concentrated only to the degree in which the
geographical position of the separate beds of ore make concentra­
tion seem profitable. In short, one can see nowhere in primary
production any tendency to concentrate productive units. This is
equally true of transport.

§3
The optimal size of establishments in manufacturing
The process of manufacture out of raw materials is to a certain
extent free from the limitations of space. The working of cotton
plantations cannot be concentrated, but the spinning and weaving
works may be united. But, here too, it would be rash to derive
without further consideration a Law of the Concentration of
Establishments from the fact that the larger plant generally proves
superior to the smaller.
For in industry too localization is of importance, quite apart from
the fact that (other things being equal, i.e. at a given level of the
division of labour) the economic superiority of the larger productive
unit exists only in so far as the Law of the Optimal Combination of
Factors of Production demands it and that consequently no advant­
age is to be gained by enlarging the establishment beyond the point
where the instruments are most efficiently utilized. Each type of
production has a natural location, which depends ultimately on the
geographical distribution of primary production. The fact that
primary production cannot be concentrated must influence the
subsequent process of manufacture. The power of this influence
varies with the importance attaching to the transport of raw materials
and finished products in the separate branches of production.
A Law of the Concentration of Establishments operates therefore
only in so far as the division of labour leads to progressive division of
production into new branches. This concentration is really nothing
more than the reverse side of the division oflabour. As a result of the
division of labour numerous dissimilar establishments, within which
uniformity is the rule, replace numerous similar establishments
within which various different processes of production are carried

out. It causes the number of similar plants to decrease, whilst the
circle of persons, for whose needs they work directly or indirectly,
grows. If the production of raw materials was not geographically
fixed, a circumstance which acts counter to the process initiated
by the division of labour, one single plant only would exist for
every branch of production. 1

§I
The horizontal concentration of enterprises
HE merger of several similar independent establishments into one

T enterprise may be called horizontal concentration of production.

Here we follow broadly the usage of writers on cartels, though their
definition is not in complete accord with ours. If the separate
establishments do not remain completely independent, if, for example
the management or some departments are amalgamated, there is
concentration of establishments. A mere concentration of enterprises
occurs only when the individual units remain independent in every­
thing except the taking of decisive economic decisions. The typical
example of this is a cartel or a syndicate. Everything stays as it was,
but, according to whether it is a buying cartel or a selling cartel
or both, decisions about purchases and sales are taken unitarily.
When it is not merely the preliminary step to an amalgamation
of establishments, the purpose of these unions is monopolistic
domination of the market. Horizontal concentration originates
only in the efforts of separate entrepreneurs to derive those advant­
ages enjoyed under certain circumstances by the monopolist.

§2
The vertical concentration of ent�rprises
Vertical concentration is the union into one unitary enterprise of
independent enterprises, some of which use the products of the others.
This terminology follows the usage of modern economic literature.
Examples of vertical concentration are the union of weaving,
spinning, bleaching and dyeing works ; a printing works to which a
paper factory and a newspaper enterprise are joined ; the mixed
works of the iron industry and of coal mining, etc.
371

THE CONCENTRAT I ON O F ENTERPR I S E S
Each productive unit is a vertical concentration of part processes
and of apparatus. Unity of production is created by the fact that part
of the means of production - certain machines, buildings, the
direction of the works - is jointly held. Such joint holding is lacking
in the vertical union of enterprises. Here the essence of the union lies in
the will of the entrepreneur to make one enterprise serve another.
The mere fact that one man owns two enterprises is not in itself
sufficient if this will does not exist. Where a chocolate manufacturer
owns also an iron works there is no vertical concentration. Vertical
concentration is usually considered to aim at ensuring an outlet for
the product or safeguarding the source of raw materials and half
finished goods. This is what entrepreneurs reply when questioned as
to the advantages of such combinations. Many economists accept
it without question, for apparently they do not think it is their job
to scrutinize what is said by 'practical men ' ; and after accepting the
statement as final they proceed to examine it from the ethical point
of view. Still, even if they avoid thinking about it, closer research
into facts should show them the truth. There is the fact that
managers of plants attached to a vertical combination often have to
make complaints. The manager of the paper-mill says : 'I could get
much better value for my paper if I did not have to supply it to
"our" printing works' . The manager of the weaving-mill: 'If I
didn't have to get the yarn from "our" spinning works I could get it
cheaper'. Such complaints are the order of the day, and it is not
difficult to understand why they must accompany every vertical
concentration.
If the amalgamated establishments were individually so efficient
that they did not have to shun competition, vertical combination
would serve no special purpose. A paper factory of the best type
never needs to ensure its market. A printing works which is on a level
with its competitors does not need to ensure its paper supply. The
efficient enterprise sells where it gets the best prices, buys where it
can do so most economically. Hence, it does not follow that two
enterprises, working at different stages of the same branch of pro­
duction and held by one owner, must necessarily unite in vertical
combination. Only when one or other of them shows itself less able
to sustain competition does the entrepreneur conceive the idea of
supporting it by tying it to the strong one. He looks to the profits of
the prosperous business for a fund to cover the deficits of the non3 72

prosperous. Apart from tax remissions and other special advantages,
such as those which the mixed works in the German iron industry
were able to derive from cartel agreements, union achieves nothing
but an apparent profit in one enterprise and an apparent loss in the
other.
The number and importance of vertical concentrations is
extraordinarily overestimated. In modern capitalist economic life
on the contrary, new branches of enterprise are constantly forming
and parts of those existing are constantly breaking away to become
independent.
The progressive tendency to specialization in modern industry
shows that development is moving away from vertical concentration,
which, except where it is demanded by considerations of productive
technique, is always an exceptional phenomenon, generally to be
explained by regard for the legal and other political conditions of
production. But even here the break-up of such unions and the re­
establishment of individual enterprise is to be witnessed over and
over again.

§I
The problem

TENDENCY to the concentration of establishments or to the concen­
A tration of enterprises is not by any means equivalent to a tendency
to the concentration of fortunes. In the same degree in which establish­
ments and enterprises became bigger and bigger modern capitalism
has developed forms of enterprise which enable people with small
fortunes to undertake big businesses. The proof that there is no
tendency to concentrate fortunes lies in the number of these types of
enterprises that have come up and are growing daily in importance,
while the individual merchant has almost disappeared from large
scale industry, mining, and transport. The history of forms of enter­
prise, from the societas unius acti to the modern joint stock com­
pany, is a wholesale contradiction of the doctrine of the concentration
of capital so arbitrarily set up by Marx.
If we wish to prove that the poor are becoming ever more
numerous and poorer, and the rich ever less numerous and richer, it
is useless to point out that in a period of remote antiquity, as elusive
to us as the Golden Age to Ovid and Virgil, the differences of wealth
were less than they are to-day. We must prove that there is an
economic cause which leads imperatively to the concentration of
fortunes. The Marxians have not even attempted this. Their theory
which ascribes to the capitalist age a sp ecial tendency towards the
concentration of fortunes, is pure invention. The attempt to give it
some sort of historical foundation is hopeless and adduces just the
contrary of that which Marx asserts to be demonstrable.

The foundation offortunes outside the market economy
The desire for an increase of wealth can be satisfied through
exchange, which is the only method possible in a capitalist economy,

FORTUNES OUTS I D E MARKET ECONOMY
or by violence and petition as in a militarist society, where the strong
acquire by force, the weak by petitioning. In the feudal society
ownership of the strong endures only so long as they have the power
to hold it; that of the weak is always precarious, for having been
acquired by grace of the strong it is always dependent on them. The
weak hold their property without legal protection. In a militarist
society, therefore, there is nothing but power to hinder the strong
from extending their wealth. They can go on enriching themselves
as long as no stronger men oppose them.
Nowhere and at no time has the large scale ownership of land
come into being through the working of economic forces in the
market. It is the result of military and political effort. Founded by
violence, it has been upheld by violence and by that alone. As soon
as the latifundia are drawn into the sphere of market transactions
they begin to crumble, until at last they disappear completely.
Neither at their formation nor in their maintenance have economic
causes operated. The great landed fortunes did not arise through the
economic superiority of large scale ownership, but through violent
annexation outside the area of trade. 'And they covet fields' com­
plains the prophet Micah, l 'and take them by violence; and houses,
and take them away.' Thus comes into existence the property of
those who, in the words of Isaiah, 'join house to house . . . lay field
to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the
midst of the earth'.'
The non-economic origin of landed fortunes is clearly revealed
by the fact that, as a rule, the expropriation by which they have been
created in no way alters the manner of production. The old owner
remains on the soil under a different legal title and continues to
carry on production.
Land ownership may be founded also on gifts. It was in this way
that the Church acquired its great possessions in the Frankish
kingdom. Not later than the eighth century, these latifundia fell
into the hands of the nobility; according to the older theory this was
the result of secularizations by Charles Martel and his successors,
but recent research is inclined to make ' an offensive of the lay
aristocrats' responsibie.;

That in a market economy it is difficult even now to uphold the
latifundia, is shown by the endeavours to create legislation institu­
tions like .the 'Fideikommiss' (feoffment in trust) and related legal
institutions such as the English 'entail'. The purpose of the ' Fidei­
kommiss' was to maintain large-scale landed proprietorship, because
it could not be kept together otherwise . The Law of Inheritance is
changed, mortgaging and alienation are made impossible, and the
State is appointed guardian of the indivisibility and inalienability of
the property, so that the prestige of family tradition shall not be
impaired. If economic circumstances had tended towards the
continuous concentration of land ownership such laws would have
been superfluous. Legislation would have been enacted against the
formation of estates rather than for their protection. But of such laws
legal history knows nothing. The regulations against 'Bauernlegen',
against enclosing arable land, etc., are directed against movements
outside the area of trade, that is, against force. The legal restrictions
of mortmain are similar. The lands of the mortmain, which, inci­
dentally, are legally protected in much the same way as the 'Fidei­
kommiss', do not increase by force of economic development but
through pious donations.
Now the highest concentration of fortunes is to be found just in
agriculture, where concentration of establishments is impossible and
the concentration of enterprises economically purposeless, where the
large property appears to be economically inferior to the small and
unable to withstand it in free competition. Never was the ownership
of the means of production more closely concentrated than at the
time of Pliny, when half the province of Mrica was owned by six
people, or in the days of the Merovingians, when the Church
possessed the greater part of all French soil. And in no part of the
world is there less large-scale land ownership than in capitalist North
America.

§3
The formation offortunes within the market economy
The assertion that wealth on the one hand and poverty on the
other are ever increasing was maintained at first without any
conscious connection with an economic theory. Its supporters think
they have derived it from an observation of social relations. But the

3 79

FORTUNES

MAR KET

E CONOMY

observer's judgment is influenced by the idea that the sum of wealth
in any society is a given quantity, so that if some possess more others
must possess less. 1 As, however, in every society the growth of new
riches and the coming into existence of new poverty are always to be
found in a conspicuous manner whilst the slow decline of ancient
fortunes and the slow enrichment of less propertied classes easily
escape the eye of the inattentive student, it is easy to arrive at the
premature conclusion summed up in the socialist catchword 'the
rich richer, the poor poorer' .
No protracted argument is required to prove that the evidence
completely fails to substantiate this assertion. It is quite an un­
founded hypothesis that in a society based on the division of labour
the wealth of some implies the poverty of others. Under certain
assumptions it is true of militarist societies, where there is no division
of labour. But of a capitalist society it is untrue. Moreover an
opinion formed on the basis of casual observations of that narrow
section with which the individual is personally acquainted is quite
insufficient proof of the theory of concentration.
The foreigner who visits England equipped with good recom­
mendations has opportunities for learning something of the noble
and wealthy families, and their manner of living. If he wants to
know more or feels it his duty to make his visit more than a mere
pleasure trip, he is allowed to make a flying tour of the works of
great enterprises. For the layman, there is nothing particularly
attractive about this. At first the noise, the bustle, the activity
astonish the visitor, but after inspecting two or three factories the
spectacle grows monotonous. Such a study of social relations, on the
other hand, as can be undertaken during a short visit to England,
is more stimulating. A walk through the slums of London or any
other large city produces more vivid impressions, and the effect on
the traveller who, when not occupied in this study, will be hurrying
from one entertainment to another, is twice as powerful. Thus visits
to the slums have become a popular item in the itinerary of the
Continental's obligatory tour of England. In this way the future
statesman and economist gathered an impression of the effects of
industry on the masses, which became a basis for the social views of
a lifetime. He went home firm in the opinion that industry makes
few rich and many poor. When later he wrote or spoke about

industrial conditions he never forgot to describe the misery he had
found in the slums, elaborating the most painful details, often with
more or less conscious exaggeration. All the same his picture tells us
nothing more than that some people are rich and some poor. But
to know this, we do not need the report of people who have seen the
suffering with their own eyes. Before they wrote we knew that
Capitalism has not yet abolished all misery in the world. What they
have to set about proving is that the number of wealthy people is
decreasing, while the wealthy individual grows richer, and that the
number and the poverty of the poor is steadily on the increase. It
would, however, take a theory of economic evolution to prove this.
Attempts to demonstrate by statistical research the progressive
increase of the misery of the masses and the growth of wealth among
a numerically diminishing rich class are no better than these mere
appeals to emotion. The estimates of money incomes at the disposal
of statistical inquiry are unusable because the purchasing power of
money alters. This fact alone is enough to show that we lack any
basis for comparing arithmetically the distribution of income over a
number of years. For where it is not possible to reduce to a common
denominator the various goods and services of which incomes are
composed, one cannot form any series for historical comparison from
known statistics of income and capital.
The attention of sociologists is often drawn to the fact that mer­
cantile and industrial wealth, that is, wealth not invested in land
and mining property, seldom maintains itself in one family for a
long period. The bourgeois families rise steadily from poverty to
wealth, sometimes so quickly that a man who has been in want a
few years previously becomes one of the richest of his time. The
history of modern fortunes is full of stories of beggar boys who have
made themselves millionaires. Litde is said of the decay of fortunes
among the well-to-do. This does not usually take place so quickly
as to strike the casual observer; closer examination, however, will
reveal how unceasing the process is. Seldom does mercantile and
industrial wealth maintain itself in one family for more than two or
three generations, unless, by investment in land, it has ceased to be
wealth of this nature. 1 It becomes property in land, no longer used
in the business of active acquisition.
Fortunes invested in capital do not, as the naive economic

philosophy of the common man imagines, represent eternal sources
of income. That capital yields a profit, that it even maintains itself
at all, is by no means a self-evident fact following a priori from the
fact of its existence. The capital goods, of which capital is concretely
composed, appear and disappear in production; in their place come
other goods, ultimately consumption goods, out of the value of
which the value of the capital mass must be reconstituted. This is
possible only when the production has been successful, that is when
it has produced more value than it absorbed. Not only profits of
capital, but the reproduction of capital presupposes a successful pro­
cess of production. The profits of capital and the maintenance of
capital are always the result of successful enterprise. If this enterprise
fails, the investor loses not only the yield on the capital, but his original
capital fund as well. One ought carefully to distinguish between pro­
duced means of production and the primary factors of production. In
agriculture and forestry the original and indestructible forces of the
soil are maintained even though production fails, for faulty manage­
ment cannot dissipate them. They may become valueless through
changes in demand, but they cannot lose their inherent capacity to
yield produce. This is not so in manufacturing production . There
everything can be lost, root and branch. Production must continually
replenish capital. The individual capital goods which compose it
have a limited life ; the existence of capital is prolonged only by the
manner in which the owner deliberately reinvests it in production.
To own capital one must earn it afresh day by day. In the long run
a capital fortune is not a source of income which can be enjoyed in
idleness.
To combat these arguments by pointing to the steady yield from
'good' capital investments would be wrong. The point is that the
investments must be 'good', and to be that, they must be the result
of successful speculation. Arithmetical jugglers have calculated the
amount to which a penny, invested at compound interest at the
time of Christ, would have grown by now. The result is so striking
that one might very well ask why nobody was clever enough to reap
a fortune this way. But quite apart from all the other obstacles to
such a course of action, there is the crowning disability that to every
capital investment is attached the risk of a total or partial loss of the
original capital sum. This is true not only of the entrepreneur's
investment, but also of the investment the capitalist makes in lending
3 79

THE

CONCENTRAT I ON O F FORTUNES

to the entrepreneur, for his investment naturally depends completely
on the entrepreneur's. His risk is smaller, because the entrepreneur
offers him as sec,urity that part of his own wealth which is outside the
immediate undertaking, but qualitatively the two risks are the same.
The moneylender too can, and often does, lose his wealth. 1
An eternal capital investment is as non-existent as a secure one.
Every capital investment is speculative; its success cannot be fore­
seen with absolute assurance. Not even the idea of an 'eternal and
secure' capital yield could have arisen if the concepts of capital in­
vestment had been taken from the sphere of business and capital
enterprise. The ideas of eternity and security come from rents
secured on landed property and from the related government
securities. It corresponds to actual conditions when the law
recognizes as trustee investments onl/ those which are in land or in
incomes secured on iand or afforded by the State or by other public
corporations. In capitalist enterprise there is no secure income and
no security of wealth. It is obvious that an entail invested in enter­
prises outside agriculture, forestry, and mining would be senseless.
If, then, capital sums do not grow of themselves, if for their
maintenance alone, quite apart from their fructification and increase,
successful speculation is constantly required, there can be no question
whatever of a tendency for fortunes to grow bigger and bigger. For­
tunes cannot grow; someone has to increase them! For this the
successful activity of an entrepreneur is needed. The capital repro­
duces itself, bears fruit and increases only so long as a successful and
lucky investment endures. The more rapid the change in economic
environment the shorter the time in which an investment is to be
considered as good. For the making of new investments, for re­
organization of production, for innovations in technique, abilities
are needed which only a few possess. If under exceptional circum­
stances these are inherited from generation to generation, the suc­
cessors are able to maintain the wealth left by their ancestors, even
perhaps to increase it, despite the fact that it may have been split
up on inheritance. But if, as is generally the case, the heirs are not

I Considerant tries to prove the theory of concentration with a metaphor borrowed

from mechanics: 'Les capitaux suivent anjourd'hui sans contrepoids la loi de leur
propre gravitation; c'est que, s'attirant en raison de leurs masses, les richesses sociales
se concentrent de plus en plus entre les mains des grands possesseurs'. Quoted by

p. 62. That is word play, nothing more.

equal to the demands which life makes on an entrepreneur, the
inherited wealth rapidly vanishes.
When rich entrepreneurs wish to perpetuate their wealth in the
family they take refuge "in land. The descendants of the Fuggers and
the Welsers live even to-day in considerable affluence, if not luxury,
but they have long since ceased to be merchants and have trans­
formed their wealth into landed property. They became members of
the German nobility, differing in no way from other South German
noble families. Numerous merchant families in other countries have
undergone the same development; having become rich in trade and
industry they have ceased to be merchants and entrepreneurs and

have become landowners, not to increase their fortunes but to main­
tain them and transmit them to their children and their children's
children. The families which did otherwise soon disappeared in
obscure poverty. There are fevl banking families v/hose business has
existed for a hundred years or more, and a closer glance at the
affairs of these few will show that they are generally commercially
active only in administering fortunes really invested in land and
mines. There are no ancient fortunes which thrive in the sense that
they continually increase.

§4
The theory of increasing poverty
The theory of incr.easing poverty among the masses stands at the
centre of Marxist thought as well as of older socialist doctrines. The
a ;cumulation of poverty parallels the accumulation of capital. It is
the 'antagonistic character ofcapitalist production' that 'the accumu­
lation of wealth at one pole' is simultaneously 'accumulation of
misery, work torture, slavery, ignorance, brutalization, and moral
degeneracy at the other'. 1

This is the theory of the progressive

increase in the absolute poverty of the masses. Based on nothing but
the tortuous processes of an abstruse system of thought, it need
occupy us all the less in that it is gradually receding into the back­
ground, even in the writings of orthodox Marxian disciples and the
official programmes of the social-democratic parties. Even Kautsky,
during the revisionism quarrel, was reduced to conceding that,

according to all the facts, it was precisely in the most advanced
capitalist countries that physical misery was on the decline, and that
the working classes had a higher standard of life than fifty years
ago. 1 The Marxians still cling to the theory of increasing poverty
purely on account of its propaganda value, and exploit it to-day just
as much as during the youth of the now aged Party.
But intellectually the theory of the relative growth of pbverty,
developed by Rodbertus, has replaced the theory of absolute growth.
'Poverty', says Rodbertus, 'is a social, that is, a relative, concept.
Now, I maintain that the justifiable needs of the working classes,
since these have attained a higher social position, have become con­
siderably more numerous. It would be as wrong, now that they have
attained this position, not to speak, even with unchanged wages, of
a deterioration in their material condition as it would have been at
an earlier stage v{hen their \vages fell, and they had not yet attained
this position.'1 This thought is derived entirely from the point of
view of the State Socialist, which considers a raising of the workers'
claims to be 'justified' and assigns them a 'higher position' in the
social order. Against arbitrary judgments of this kind, no argument
is .possible.
. The Marxians have taken over the doctrine of the relative growth
of poverty. 'If in the course of evolution the grandson of a small
master weaver, who had lived with his own journeymen, comes to
inhabit a palatial, magnificently furnished villa, while the journey­
man's grandson lives in lodgings, which though more comfortable,
no doubt, than his grandfather's garret in the master weaver's house,
yet serves to widen the social gulf between the two, then the journey­
man's grandson will feel his poverty all the more for seeing the com­
forts that are within his employer's reach. His own position is better
than his ancestor's, his standard of living has risen, but relatively his
situation has become worse. Social misery becomes greater . . . the
workers relatively more wretched.'1 Assuming that this were true,
it would be no indictment against the capitalist system. If Capital­
ism improves the economic position all round, it is of secondary
importance that it does not raise all to the same level. A social order
is not bad simply because it helps one more than another. If I am

doing better, what can it harm me that others are doing better still?
Must one destroy Capitalism which satisfies better from day to day
the wants of all p eople, merely because some individuals become
rich and a few of them very rich? How, then, can it be asserted as
'logically unassailable' that 'a growth in the relative poverty of the
masses . . . must finally end in catastrophe.' 1
Kautsky tries to make his conception of the Marxian theory of
increasing poverty different from that which emerges from an un­
prej udiced reading of Das Kapital. 'The word poverty', he says, 'may
mean physical poverty, but it may also mean social poverty. In the
first sense it is measured by man's physiological needs. These are
indeed not everywhere and at all times the same, still they do not
show differences nearly so great as the social needs, non-satisfaction
of which produces social poverty.'J It is social poverty, says Kautsky,
that Marx had in mind. Considering the clarity and precision of
Marx's style this interpretation is a masterpiece of sophistry, and it was
accordingly rejected by the revisionists. To the person who does not
take Marx's words as revelation it may, indeed, be a matter of in­
difference whether the theory of increasing social poverty is con­
tained in the first volume of Das Kapital or is taken from Engels or
was first p ut forward by the n eo-marxists. The important questions
are whether it is tenable and what conclusions follow from it.
Kautsky holds that the growth of poverty in the social sense is
'attested by the bourgeoisie themselves, only they have given the
matter a different name; they call it c(Jvetousness
The decisive fact
is that the contrast between the wage-earners' needs and the possi­
bility of satisfying them out of wages, the contrast therefore between
wage-earning and capital, is becoming greater and greater'.! Covet­
ousness has always existed, however; it is no new phenomenon.
We may even admit that it is more prevalent now than formerly;
the general striving after improvement of economic position is a
peculiarly characteristic mark of capitalist society. But how one can
conclude from this that the capitalist order of society must neces­
sarily change into the socialist, is inexplicable.
The fact is, that the doctrine of increasing relative social poverty
is nothing more than an attempt to give an economic justification to

policies based on the resentment of the masses. Growing social poverty
means merely growing envy. 1 Mandeville and Hume, two of the
greatest observers of human nature, have remarked that the intensity
of envy depends on the distance between the envier and the envied.
If the distance is great one does not compare oneself with the envied,
and, in fact, no envy is felt. The smaller the distance, however, the
greater the envy! Thus one can deduce from the growth of resent­
ment in the masses that inequalities of income are diminishing. The
increasing 'covetousness' is not, as Kautsky thinks, a proof of the
relative growth of poverty; on the contrary, it shows that the
economc distance between the classes is becoming less and less.

CHAPTER V
MONOPOLY AND I T S E F FECTS

§I
The nature of monopoly and its significance for the formation of prices
o other part of economic theory has been so much misunder­
The mere mention of the word
monopoly usually stirs up emotions which make clear judgment
impossible and provokes, instead of economic arguments, the usual
moral indignation evinced in etatistic and other anti-capitalist
literature. Even in the United States the controversy raging over
the trust problem has supplanted all impartial dis�ussi�n �f the
problem of monopoly.
The widespread view that the monopolist can fix prices at will,
that - in common phrase - he can dictate prices, is as erroneous as
the conclusion, derived from this view, that he has in his hands the
power to do whatever he likes. This could only be the case if the
commodity monopolized were, by its very essence, completely out­
side the range of other goods. A man who could monopolize the
atmosphere or drinking water could undoubtedly force all other
human beings to obey him blindly. Such a monopoly would be un­
hampered by any competing economic agency. The monopolist
would be able to dispose freely of the lives and property of his fellow­
men. Such monopolies, however, do not come under our theory of
monopoly. Water and air are free goods, and where they are not
free - as in the case of water on a mountain top - one can evade
the effect of monopoly by moving to a different place. Perhaps the
nearest approach to such a monopoly was the power to administer
grace to believers, exercised by the medieval Church. Excommuni­
cation and interdict were no less terrible than death from thirst or
suffocation. In a socialist community the State as orllanized societv

MONOPOLY AND

ITS EFFECTS

The only monopolies which concern us here are trade monopolies.
They affect only economic goods which, however important and
indispensable they may seem, do not of themselves exert any decisive
power over human life. When a commodity of which a definite
minimum is essential to everyone who wishes to go on living, falls
under a monopoly, then indeed do all those consequences popularly
assigned to monopolies inevitably follow. But we need not discuss
this hypothesis. It is of no practical importance as it lies outside the
range of economics, and therefore of price theory - except in the
case of strikes in certain enterprises. 1 A distinction between goods
which are essential to life and those which are not, is sometimes made
when the effects of monopoly are being considered. But these sup­
posedly indispensable commodities are, strictly speaking, not what
they seem.

As the whole argument is based on the strict concept

indispensability, we have first of all to consider whether we have to
deal with indispensability in the exact and full meaning of the word.
Actually we can dispense with the commodities in question, either
by renouncing the services we obtain from them or by procuring
those services from some alternative commodity. Bread is certainly
an important commodity. Yet one can live without it, by living on
potatoes, cakes made from maize, and so on. Coal, so important
to-day that it might be called the bread of industry, is not, in the
strict sense of the word, indispensable, for power and heat can be
produced without coal too. And this is all that matters. The con­
cept 'monopoly' which alone concerns us here is that contained in the
theory of price monopoly and is the only one which contributes
materially to an understanding of economic conditions; it does not
demand that a monopolized commodity shall be indispensable,
unique, and without substitute. It assumes only the absence of per­
fect competition on the side of supply.!
Such loose concepts of monopoly are, moreover, not merely in­

appropriate; they are also theoretically misleading. They lead to the
supposition that price phenomena can be explained without further
investigation by demonstrating a monopolistic condition. Having
once laid it down that the monopolist 'dictates' prices, that his
att�mpt to raise prices as high as possible could only be restrained

1 See p. 483 of this work.

• A:s there cannot be any question here of giving a theory of monopoly price, the

monopoly of supply alone is examined.

MONO POLY

AND

PRICES

by a 'power' influencing the market from outside, such theorists
proceed to render the concept of monopoly so elastic as to include all
commodities not increasable or only increasable with increasing
costs. As this already comprises most price phenomena, they are
able to avoid the necessity of working out a theory of prices them­
selves. As a result many come to speak of the monopoly ownership
of land and believe that they have solved the problem of rent by
pointing out that this monopolistic relation exists. Others go further
and seek to explain interest, profit, and even wages as monopoly
prices and monopoly profits. Quite apart from other defects in these
'explanations' , their authors fail to perceive that, while alleging that
a monopoly exists, they say nothing at all about the nature of price
formation and that therefore the catchword monopoly is no sub­
stitute for a properly developed theory of prices. 1
The laws determining monopoly prices are the same as those
which determine other prices. The monopolist cannot ask any price
he fancies. The price offers with which he enters the market influ­

ence the attitude of the buyers. Demand expands or contracts accord­
ing to the price he demands, and he has to reckon with this like any
other seller. The one and only peculiarity of monopoly is that,
assuming a certain shape for the demand curve, the maximum net
profit .lies at a higher price than would have been the case in com­
petition between sellers.' If we assume these conditions and if the
monopolist cannot so discriminate as to exploit the purchasing power
of each class of buyers, it pays him better to sell at th� higher
monopoly price than at the lower competitive price, even though
sales are thereby diminished. Therefore, monopoly under such con­
ditions has three results: the market price is higher, the profit is
greater, both the quantity sold and the consumptiol'l are smaller than
they would have been under free competition.
The last of these results must be examined more closely. If there
is more of the monopolized commodity than can be placed at the
monopoly price the monopolist must lock up or destroy so many

criticized by Ely and generally abandoned by the price theory of modern science.

surplus units that the remainder may attain the price needed. Thus
the Dutch East India Company, which monopolized the European
coffee market in the seventeenth century, destroyed some of its
stocks. Other monopolists have done likewise : the Greek Govern­
ment, for instance, destroyed currants in order to raise the price.
Economically only one verdict on these proceedings is possible : they
diminish the stock of wealth which serves to satisfy needs, they reduce
welfare, they diminish riches. That goods which could have satisfied
wants, and foodstuffs which could have stilled the hunger of the many,
should be destroyed is a state of things which the outraged populace
and the discerning economist unite, for once, in condemning.
Even in monopolistic undertakings, however, destruction of
economic goods is rare. The far-sighted monopolist does not produce
goods for the incinerator. If he wishes to place fewer goods on the
market he takes steps to reduce his output. The problem of monopoly
must be considered, not from the point of view of goods destroyed,
but from that of production restricted.

§2
The economic effects of isolated monopolies
Whether the monopolist can exploit his position at all depends on
the shape of the demand curve of the monopolized commodity and
on the costs of producing the marginal unit of the commodity at the
existing scale of production. Only when the conditions are such that
the sale of a smaller quantity at higher prices yields a greater net
profit than the sale of a larger quantity at lower prices, is it possible
to apply the specific principle of monopolistic policy. 1 But even then
it is applied only if the monopolist fails to find a method of securing
still higher profits. The monopolist serves his interests best if he can
separate buyers into classes according to their purchasing power, for
he can then exploit the purchasing power of each class separately
and exact the highest prices from its members. Railways and other
transport undertakings, which grade their tariffs according to what
the traffic win bear are in this class. If, foUowing the generai method

ECONOMIC EFFECTS

of monopolists, they treated all users of transport uniformly, those
less able to pay would be excluded from transport and for those able
to stand higher charges transport would be cheapened. The effect
of this on the local distribution of industry is clear; amongst the
factors determining the localization of individual industries the
transport factor would make itself felt in a different way.
In examining the economic effect of monopoly, we must limit
investigation to the type which restricts the production of its com­
modity. Now the result of this restriction is not that less is produced
quantitively. Capital and labour, set free by the restriction of pro­
duction, must find employment in other production. For in the long
run in the free economy there is neither unemployed capital nor
unemployed labour. Thus against the smaller production of the
monopolized goods one must set the increased production of other
goods. But these, of course, are less important goods, which would
not have been produced and consumed if the more pressing demands
for a larger quantity of the monopolized commodity could have been
satisfied. The difference between the value of these goods and the
higher value of the quantity of the monopolized commodity not pro­
duced represents the loss of welfare which the monopoly has inflicted
on the national economy. Here private profit and socia] productivity
are at variance. A socialist society under such circumstances would
act differently from a capitalist society.
It has often been pointed out that although the monopoly can
prove harmful to the consumer it might, on the other hand, be
turned to his advantage. Monopoly could produce more cheaply be­
cause it eliminates all the expenses of competition and because, being
adapted to large scale operations it enjoys all advantages of the
division of labour. But this in no wise alters the fact that monopoly
deflects production from more important products to less important
ones. It may be, as the defender of trusts is fond of repeating, that
the monopolist, unable to increase his profit otherwise� endeavours
to improve productive technique, but it is difficult to understand why
the urge to this should be greater in him than in the competitive
producer. Even if this be admitted, however, it does not alter what
we have said about the social effects of monopoly.

389

MONOPOLY AND ITS E FFE CTS

§3
The limits of monopoly formation
The possibility of monopolizing the market varies radically with
different goods. Even the producer who is protected from com­
petition need not necessarily be in a position to sell at monopoly
prices and obtain monopoly profits. If the quantity sold falls so
steeply with the rise of prices that the extra sum obtained does not
cover the deficiency in the number sold, then the monopolist is
forced to content himself with the price which would have emerged
under competitive selling. 1
Apart from the enjoyment of artificial support - the grant of
special legal privileges, for example - we shall find that a monopoly
can, as a rule, maintain itself only by the exclusive power to dispose
of certain natural factors of production. Similar -power over repro­
duceable means of production does not as a rule allow permanent
monopolization. New enterprises may always spring up. As already
pointed out, the progressive division of labour tends towards a con­
dition in which, at the highest specialization of production, everyone
will be the sole producer of one or several articles. But this would by
no means necessarily involve a monopolized market for all these
articles. The attempts of manufacturers to extract monopoly prices
would, apart from other circumstances, be checked by the appearance
of new competitors.
Experience of cartels and trusts during the last generation com­
pletely confirms this. All enduring monopolistic organizations are
built up on the power of the monopoly to dispose of natural resources
or of particular land sites. A man who tried to become a monopolist
without the control of such resources - and without special legal
aids such as tariffs, patents, etc. - had to resort to all sorts of tricks
and artifices to secure even a temporary success. The complaints
raised against cartels and trusts and investigated by the commissions
of inquiry whose published records are so voluminous, deal almost
exclusively with these tricks and practices, which aim at creating
monopolies artificially where the conditions for them do not exist.
Most cartels and trusts would never have been set up had not the
governments created the necessary conditions by protectionist mea­
sures. Manufacturing and commercial monopolies owe their origin
1 According to Wieser

(ibid.) this is 'perhaps even the rule'.

390

S I G N I F I CANCE I N P R I MARY PRODUCT ION

not to a tendency immanent in capitalist economy but to govern­
mental interventionist policy directed against free trade and laisser­

faire.

Without the special power to dispose of natural resources, or of
advantageously situated land, monopolies could arise only where the
capital required to erect a competing enterprise was not able to count
on an adequate return. A railway company can achieve a monopoly
where it would not pay to build a competing line, the traffic being
too small for two lines to be profitable. The same may be true in
other cases. But while this shows that a few monopolies of this kind
are possible it does not reveal a general tendency to their formation.
The effect of such monopolies, e.g. the railway company or the
electric power plant, is that the monopolist may be able, according to
the circumstances of the case, to absorb a greater or smaller quantity
of the ground rents of adjoining properties. The result of this may
be a change in the distribution of income and property which is felt
to be disagreeable - at least, by those directly affected.

§4
The significance of monopoly in primary production
In an economy based on private ownership in the means of pro­
duction, specific primary production is the only field liable to
monopolization without special protection from the State. Mono­
polies in certain branches of primary production are possible.
Mining, in the widest sense of the word, is their true domain. Where
to-day we have monopolistic structures whkh do not spring from
government intervention, they are - apart from such instances as
the railway company and the power works - almost exclusively
organizations built up on a power to dispose of certain kinds of
natural resources. These natural resources must be such as are
found in relatively few places, for this alone makes the monopoly
possible. A world monopoly of potato farmers or milk producers is
unthinkable. 1 Potatoes and milk, or at least substitutes for them, can
be produced over the greater part of the earth's surface. World
monopolies of oH, mercury, zinc, nickel, and other materiais can
occasionally be formed if the owners of the rare places where they
1 It is different, perhaps, with agricultural productions which flourish only on
relatively restricted soils; for example, coffee growing.

39 1

MONOPOLY AND ITS EFFECTS

exist can combine; examples of this are found in the history of recent
years.
When such a monopoly is formed the higher monopoly price
replaces the competitive price. The income of mine owners rises,
production and consumption of their product fall. A quantity of
capital and labour which would otherwise have been active in this
branch of production is diverted to other fields. If we consider the
effects of monopoly from the standpoint of the separate branches of
world economy we see only the rise in the monopolists' income and
the corresponding decline in the income of all other branches. Con­
sidered, however, from the standpoint of world economy and sub­
specie aeternitatis, monopolies would appear to economize consump­
tion of irreplaceable natural resources. People come to deal more
thriftily with these precious resources when as in mining, the
monopoly price occasionally replaces the competitive price and they
are driven to do iess digging and more working up. Since in every mine
in operation nature's irreplaceable gift to man is being used up, the
less we touch this stock the better we provide for the supply of coming
generations. We see now what it means when people detect in
monopoly a conflict between social productivity and private profit.
True, a socialist community would have no occasion to restrict pro­
duction as Capitalism does under monopolies, but this would only
mean that Socialism would deal less thriftily with irreplaceable
natural treasures, that it would sacrifice the future to the present.
When we find that monopoly causes a conflict between profit and
productivity whiCh is not to be found anywhere else, we do not
necessarily say that the effects of monopoly are pernicious. The
naive assumption that the behaviour of the socialist community - as
typifying the idea of productivity - constitutes the Absolute Good
is quite arbitrary. We have no standard on which to base a valid
decision between what is good and what is evil in this context.
If, then, we consider the effects of monopoly without being biased
by popular writers on cartels and trusts, we can discover nothing
which could justify the assertion that growing monopolization makes
the capitalist system intolerable. The monopolist's scope in a capi­
talist economy free from state interference is much smaller than this
type of writer commonly assumes ; and the consequences of monopoly
must be judged by other standards than the mere catchwords Price
Dictation and the Rule of the Trust Magnates.

SOCIALISM AND ETHICS

§
The socialist attitude to ethics

OR pure Marxism Socialism is not a political programme. It
Fdoes not demand that society shall be transformed into the

socialist order, nor does it condemn the liberal order of society. It
presents itself as a scientific theory which claims to have discovered
in the dynamic laws of historical development a movement towards
the socialization of the means of production. To say that pure
Marxism pronounces itself in favour of Sociaiism or that it desires
Socialism or wishes to bring it about would be just as absurd as to
say that Astronomy wishes or thought it desirable to bring about a
solar eclipse which it had predicted. We know that Marx's life and
even many of his writings and sayings sharply contradict his theoretic
outlook and that the Socialism of resentment is always showing its
cloven hoof. In practical politics at least, his supporters have long
since forgotten what they owe strictly to his doctrine. Their words
and deeds go far beyond what the 'accoucheur theory' permits. 1
This, however, is of secondary importance for our study, which here
deals only with the doctrine pure and undefiled.
Besides the pure Marxist view that Socialism must come of in­
exorable necessity, there are two other motives which guide the
advocates of Communism. They are socialists either because they
expect socialist society to increase productivity, or because they
believe that a socialist society would be more just. Marxism is
unable to reconcile itself to ethical Socialism. But its attitude to
economic-rationalist Socialism is quite different: it is possible to
interpret the materialistic conception of history as meaning that the
1 How little the Social-Democrats have made this fundamental doctrine of Marxism
their own, one sees from a glance at their iiterature. A leader of German Social­
Democracy, the former German Minister of National Economy Wissell, confesses
succinctly: ' I am Socialist and shall remain Socialist, for 1 see in socialist economy,
with its subordination of the individual to the Whole, the expression of a higher moral
principle than that which lies at the basis of individualistic economy'. (Praktische
WiTtschaftspolitik, Berlin 1919, p. 53.)

395

SOCIALISM AND ETH I CS

trend of economic development naturally leads to the most pro­
ductive type of economy, that is to say Socialism. Of course, this
view is very different from that held by the majority of marxists.
They are for Socialism, firstly because it is bound to come in any
case, secondly because it is morally preferable, and finally because
it involves more rational economic organization.
The two motives of non-marxian Socialism are mutually
exclusive. If a man advocates Socialism because he expects it to
increase the productivity of social labour he need not try to bolster up
his demands with a higher moral valuation of the socialist order. If
he elects to do so, he is open to the question whether he would be
prepared to advocate Socialism if he discovered that it was after all
not the morally perfect order. On the other hand it is clear that one
who advocates the socialistic order for moral reasons would have to
go on doing so even if he were convinced that the order based
on private ownership in the means of production yielded greater
productivity of labour.

§2
Eudemonistic ethics and Socialism
To eudemonism, which looks at social phenomena rationalisticallyJ
the very way in which ethical Socialism states its problems seems
unsatisfactory. Unless Ethics and ' Economy' are regarded as two
systems of objectivization which have nothing to do with each other,
then ethical and economic valuation and judgment cannot appear
as mutually independent factors. All ethical ends are merely a part
of human aims. This implies that on the one hand the ethical aim
is a means, in so far as it assists in the human struggle for happiness,
but that on the other hand it is comprised in the process of valuation
which unites all intermediate aims into a unitary scale of values and
grades them according to their importance. The conception of
absolute ethical values, which might be opposed to economic values,
cannot therefore be maintained.
Of course one cannot discuss this point with the ethical a priori­
ist or the intuitionist. Those who uphold the Moral as ultimate fact,
and who rule out scientific examination of its elements by referring
to a transcendental origin, will never be able to agree with those
who are dragging down the concept of Right into the dust of scientific
3 96

EUDEMONISTIC ETH I C S
analysis. Ethical ideas of duty and conscience demand nothing less
than the blindest submission. 1 A priori ethics, claiming unconditional
validity for its norms, approaches all earthly relations from the out­
side and aims at transmuting them into its own form with no con­
cern whatever for the consequences. Fiat iustitia, pereat mundus is
its motto, and it is when it becomes honestly indignant about the
eternally misunderstood plea, 'the end justifies the means', that it is
most sincere.
Isolated man settles all his ends according to his own law. He
sees and knows nothing but himself and arranges his actions accord­
ingly. In society, however, he must temper his actions to the fact
that he lives in society and that his actions must affirm the existence
and progress of society. From the basic law of social life it follows
that he does not do this to achieve aims lying outside his own personal
system of ends. In making the social ends his own he does not
thereby subordinate his personality and his wishes to those of a
higher personality or renounce the fulfilment of any of his own
desires in favour of those of a mystical universe. For, from the stand­
point of his own valuation, social ends are not ultimate but inter­
mediate in his own scale of values. He must accept society because
social life helps him to fulfil his own wishes more completely. If he
denied it he would be able to create only transitory advantages for
himself; by destroying the social body he would in the long run
injure himself.
The idea of a dualism of motivation assumed by most ethical
theorists when they distinguish between egoistic and altruistic
motives of action, cannot therefore be maintained. This attempt to
contrast egoistic and altruistic action springs from a misconception
of the social interdependence of individuals.

The power to choose

whether my actions and conduct shall serve myself or my fellow
beings is not given to me - which perhaps may be regarded as
fortunate. If it were, human society would not be possible. In the
society based on division of labour and co-operation, the interests of
all members are in harmony, and it follows from this basic fact of
social life that ultimately action in the interests of myself and action
in the interest of others do not conflict, since the interests of indi­
viduals come together in the end. Thus the famous scientific dispute

397

S O C I A L I S M AND ETH I C S
as to the possibility of deriving the altruistic from the egoistic motives
of action may be regarded as definitely disposed of.
There is no contrast between moral duty and selfish interests.
What the individual gives to society to preserve it as society, he gives,
not for the sake of aims alien to himself, but in his own interest. 1
The individual, who is a product of society not only as a thinking,
willing, sentient man, but also simply as a living creature, cannot
deny society without denying himself.
This position' of social ends in the system of individual ends is
perceived by the individual's reason, which enables him to recognize
aright his own interests. But society cannot always trust the indi­
vidual to see which are his true interests. If it left everyone to judge
of his own it would expose itself to the caprice of every foolish, sick,
and weak-willed person, leaving him free to put its very existence
into question, thus imperilling the continuity of development. This
is what led to the creation of powers of social coercion which, vis-a-vis
the individual, appear as external constraints because they demand
imperative obedience. And here we see the social significance of the
State and the Law. They are not something outside the individual,
demanding from him actions which run counter to his own interests,
forcing him to serve alien purposes. They merely prevent the mis­
guided, asocial individual, blind to his own interests, from injuring
his fellow men by a revolt against the social order.
It is therefore absurd to maintain that Liberalism, Utilitarianism
and Eudemonism are 'inimical to the State' . They reject the idea
of Etatism, which under the name State adores as God a mysterious
being not comprehensible to human understanding; they dissent
from Hege!, to whom the State is 'divine will' ; they reject the
Hegelian Marx and his school who have replaced the cult of 'State'
with the cult of 'Society' ; they combat all those who want the State
or 'Society' to perform tasks other than those corresponding to that
social order which they themselves believe the most proper to the
end in view. Because they favour private ownership in the means of
production they demand that the State coercive apparatus shall be
directed to maintain this, and they reject all proposals intended to
restrict or abolish private property. But never for a moment do they
think of 'abolishing the State'. The liberal conception of society
by no means omits the apparatus of the State; it assigns to this the
1

E UDEMON ISTIC ETHI CS

task of safeguarding life and property. Anybody who calls opposition
to State railways, State theatres, or State dairies 'enmity to the State'
must be deeply enmeshed indeed in the realistic (in the scholastic
sense) conception of the State.
Occasionally society can prevail against the individual even

without coercion. Not every social norm requires that the most
extreme coercive measures shall at once be put into force. In many
things, morals and custom can wring from the individual a recogni­
tion of social aims without assistance from the sword of justice.
Morals and custom go further than State law in so far as they protect
more extensive social aims. In this respect, there may be a difference
in extent between them, but no incompatibility of principle. Essen­
tial contrasts between the legal order and moral laws occur only
where the two derive from different conceptions of the social order,
that is, where they appertain to different social systems. The
contrast is then dynamic, not static.
The ethical valuation 'good' or 'evil' can be applied only in
respect of ends towards which action strives. As Epicurus said :
'A8UCLot Ol> >coce' EOCU't'�\! >cocx6\!. Vice without injurious consequences
would not be vice.' 1 Since action is never its own end, but rather
the means to an end, we call an action good or evil only in respect of
the consequences of the action. It is judged according to its place
in the system of cause and effect. It is valued as a means. And for
the value of the means the valuation of the end is decisive. Ethical,
like all other, valuation proceeds from valuation of ends, of the
ultimate good. The value of an action is the value of the end it
serves. Intention, too, has value in so far as it leads to action.
Unity of action can exist only when all ultimate values can be
brought into a unitary scale of values. If this were not possible, man
would always be finding himself in a position where he could not
act, that is, work as a creature conscious of his striving towards a
goal; he would have to abandon the issue to forces beyond his con­

trol. Conscious scaling of values precedes every human action. The

decided that in the given circumstances the attainment of is more
valuable to him than the attainment of the others.
Philosophers had been arguing about this ultimate Good for a

long time before it was settled by modern investigation. At the
present day Eudemonism is no longer open to attack. In the long
run all the arguments which philosophers from Kant to Hegel
brought against it were unable to dissociate the concept Morality
from that of Happiness. Never in history has more intellect and
ingenuity been expended in defending an untenable position. We
are lost in admiration of the magnificent performance of these
philosophers. We might almost say that what they have done to
prove the impossible elicits more admiration than the achievements of
the great thinkers and sociologists who have made Eudemonism and
Utilitarianism a permanent possession of the human mind. Certainly
their efforts were not in vain. Their gigantic struggle for anti­
eudemonistic ethics were necessary to expose the problem in all its
wide ramifications and so enable a conclusive solution to be
reached.
Since the tenets of intuitionist ethics, which are irreconcilable
with scientific method, have been deprived of their very foundations,
anyone who recognizes the eudemonistic character of all ethical
valuation is exempt from further discussion of ethical Socialism.
For such a one the Moral does not stand outside the scale of values
which comprises all values of life. For him no moral ethic is valid
per se. He must first be allowed to inquire why it is so rated. He can
never reject that which has been recognized as beneficial and reason­
able simply because a norm, based on some mysterious intuition,
declares it to be immoral - a norm the sense and purpose of which
he is not entitled even to investigate. 1 His principle is not fiat
iustitia, pereat mundus, but fiat iustitia, ne pereat mundus.
If nevertheless it appears not entirely superfluous to discuss
separately the arguments of ethical Socialism, this is not merely
because it counts many adherents, but, what is more important,
because it provides an opportunity of showing how eudemonistic
ideas lie concealed in every train of a priori-istic-intuitive ethical
thought, and how this system can be traced back, in every one of its
utterances, to untenable notions of economic conduct and of social
co-operation. Every ethical system built up on the idea of duty,
even though it exhibits itself as strictly as Kant's, is finally obliged to
yield so much to Eudemonism that its principles can no longer be

maintained. 1 In the same way every single requirement of a priori­
istic-intuitive ethics displays ultimately an eudemonistic character.

§3
A contribution to the understanding of Eudemonism
Formalist ethics takes its differences with Eudemonism alto­
gether too lightly when it interprets the happiness of which the latter
speaks as satisfaction of sensual desires. More or less consciously,
formalistic ethics foists upon Eudemonism the assertion that all
human striving is directed solely towards filling the belly and the
basest forms of sensual enjoyment. It is of course not to be denied
that the thoughts and endeavours of many, very many people are
concentrated on these things. This, however, is no fault of social
science, which merely points it out as a fact. Eudemonism does not
advise men to strive after happiness; it merely shows that human
striving necessarily tends in this direction. And after all, happiness is
not to be found only in sexual enjoyment and a good digestion.
The energistic conception of the Moral sees the highest good in
fulfilling oneself, in the full exercise of one's own powers, and this is
perhaps only another way of saying what eudemonists have in mind
when they speak of happiness. The happiness of the strong and the
healthy certainly does not lie in idle dreaming. But when this con­
ception is contrasted with Eudemonism it becomes untenable. What
are we to make of Guyau when he says : 'Life is not calculation, but
action. In every living being there is a store of strength, a surplus of
energy, which strives to spend itself, not for tlte sake of the accompanying
pleasurable setzsations but because it must spend itself . Duty derives from
strength, which necessarily urges towards action.'! Action mean
working with a conscious end, that is, on a basis of reflection and
calculation. Guyau is guilty of a lapse into Intuitionism, which he
otherwise rejects, when he represents a mysterious urge as the guide
of moral action. In the idees-forces of FouilIee the intuitionist element
is still more dearly revealed.' What was thought is supposed to urge

towards realization. But presumably this is only when the end,
which the action serves, seems desirable. To the question why an
end appears good or evil, however, Fouillee offers no reply.
Nothing is gained when the teacher of morals constructs an
absolute ethic without reference to the nature of man and his life.
The declamations of philosophers cannot alter the fact that life
strives to live itself out, that the living being seeks pleasure and
avoids pain. All one's scruples against acknowledging this as the
basic law of human actions fall away as soon as the fundamental
principle of social co-operation is recognized. That everyone lives
and wishes to live primarily for himself does not disturb social life
but promotes it, for the higher fulfilment of the individual's life is
possible only in and through society. This is the true meaning of the
doctrine that egoism is the basic law of society.
The highest demand that Society makes of the individual is the
sacrifice of his life. Though all other restrictions of his action which
the individual has to accept from society may be considered ulti­
mately in his own interests, this, says the anti-eudemonistic ethic,
can be explained by no method which smooths over the opposition
between individual and general interests. The hero's death may be
useful to the community, but that is no great consolation to him.
Only an ethic based on duty could help one over this difficulty. On
closer considerations we see that this objection may be easily dis­
proved. When society's existence is threatened, each individual must
risk his best to avoid destruction. Even the prospect of perishing in
the attempt can no longer deter him. For there is then no choice
between either living on as one formerly lived or sacrificing oneself
for one's country, for society, or for one's convictions. Rather, must
the certainty of death, servitude, or insufferable poverty be set against
the chance of returning victorious from the struggle. War carried on
pro aris et focis demands no sacrifice from the individual. One does
not engage in it merely to reap benefits for others, but to preserve
one's own existence. This of course, is only true of wars in which
individuals fight for their very existence. It is not true of wars which
are merely a means of enrichment, such as the quarrels of feudal
lords or the cabinet wars of princes. Thus Imperialism, ever
covetous of conquests, cannot do without an ethic which demands
from the individual 'sacrifices' for the 'good of the State'.
The long fight carried on by moralists against the convenient
402

UNDERSTAND ING OF EUD EMONISM

eudemonistic explanation of the Moral finds its counterpart in the
efforts of economists to solve the problem of economic value other­
wise than through the utility of consumption goods. Economists had
nothing nearer to hand than the idea of value as reflecting in some
way the significance of a commodity to human welfare, nevertheless
the attempt to explain the phenomena of value with the help of this
concept has been given up again and again and other theories of
value have been persistently sought. This is because of the diffi­
culties presented by the problem of the quantity of value. There
was, for instance, the apparent contradiction that precious stones,
satisfying an obviously minor want, have a higher value than bread,
which satisfies one of the most important needs, and that air and
water, without which man simply cannot live, are generally without
value. The basis for erecting a theory of value on the utility of goods
was laid only when the idea of a scale of importance of classes of
wants was separated from that of the concrete wants themselves, and
the fact recognized that the scale according to which the importance
of the wants depending on the power to dispose of goods is judged,
is that of the concrete wants themselves. 1
The difficulty which the utilitarian-eudemonistic explanation of
the Moral had to overcome was not less than that with which
economic theory had to fight in the effort to trace economic values
back to utility. No one could discover how to bring eudemonistic
doctrine into harmony with the obvious fact that moral action
consists just in the individual's avoiding actions which seem directly
useful to him and doing that which seems directly harmful to him.
Liberal social philosophy was the first to find the solution. It showed
that by maintaining and developing the social bond each individual
serves his highest interest, so that the sacrifices made in the fulfil­
ment of social life are only temporary ones. He exchanges a smaller
direct advantage for a considerably greater indirect advantage.
Thus duty and interest coincide.t This is the meaning of the
harmony of interests of which the liberal theory of society speaks.

ASCETICISM

§I
The ascetic point of view

ITHDRAWAL from the world and denial of life are, even from
Wthe religious point of view, not ultimate ends, pursued for

their own sakes, but means to the attainment of certain transcendental
ends. But though they appear in the believer's universe as means,
they must be regarded as ultimate ends by an inquiry which cannot
go beyond earthly experience or follow the consequences of an action
beyond the limits of this life. In what follows, we shall mean by
asceticism only that which is inspired by a philosophy of life or by
religious motives. With these restrictions, asceticism is the subject
of our study. We must not confuse it with that kind of asceticism
which is only a means to certain earthly ends. If he is convinced of
the poisonous effects of liquor, a man abstains from them either to
protect his health generally or to steel his strength for a special
effort. He is no ascetic in the sense defined above.
Nowhere has the idea of withdrawal from the world and denial
of life been manifested more logically and completely than in the
Indian religion ofJainism, which is able to look back on a history of
over 2500 years. 'Homelessness,' said Max Weber, 'is the funda­
mental idea of salvation in Jainism. It means the breaking off of all
earthly relations, and therefore, above all, indifference to general
impressions and avoidance of all worldly motives, the ceasing to
act, to hope, to desire. A man who has only the capacity left to feel
and think "I am I" is homeless in this sense. He wishes neither life
nor death - because in either case it would mean desire, and that
might wake Karma. He neither has friends nor raises objections to the
actions ofothers towards him (for example, to the usual washing offeet
which the pious person performs for the saint) . He behaves accord­
ing to the principle that one should not resist evil and that the
404

THE ASCET I C POINT O F V I EW

individual's state of grace during life must be tested by his capacity
to bear trouble and pain.' 1 Jainism prohibits most strictly any
killing of living beings. Orthodox Jains burn no light during the
dark months because it would burn the moths, make no fire because
it would kill insects, strain the water before boiling it, wear a mouth
and nose veil to prevent themselves from inhaling insects. It is the
highest piety to let oneself be tortured by insects without driving
them away..
Only a section of society can realize the ideal of ascetic living, for
the ascetic cannot be a worker. The body that is exhausted by peniten­
tial exercises and castigatio.ls can do nothing but lie in passive contem­
plation and let things come to it or consume the rest of its strength
in ecstatic trances and thus hasten the cnd. The ascetic who embarks
on work and economic activity to earn for himself only the smallest
quantity of the necessities oflife abandons his principles. The history
of monasticism, not only of Christian monasticism, reveals this.
From being abodes of asceticism the monasteries sometimes became
the seat of a refined enjoyment of life.
The non-working ascetic can only exist if asceticism is not
obligatory for all. Since he cannot nourish himself without the
labour of others, labourers must exist on whom he may live" He
needs tributary laymen. His sexual abstinence requires laymen who
will bear successors. If this necessary complement is lacking, the
race of ascetics quickly dies out. As a general rule of conduct
asceticism would mean the end of the human race. The holocaust
of his own life is the end towards which the individual ascetic strives,
and though this principle may not include abstinence from all
actions necessary to maintain life with the object of putting a
premature end to it, it implies, by suppression of the sexual desire,
the destruction of society. The ascetic ideal is the ideal of vol untary
death. That no society can be built up on the ascetic principle is too
obvious to need closer explanation. For it is a destroyer of society
and life.
This fact can be overlooked only because the ascetic ideal is
seldom thought out, and still more seldom carried out, to its logical
conclusion. The ascetic in the forest who lives like the animals on

SOCIALISM AND ASCETICISM

roots and herbs is the only one who lives and acts according to his
principles. This strictly logical behaviour is rare; there are, after all,
not many people who are prepared to renounce light-heartedly the
fruits of culture, however much they may despise them in thought
and abuse them in words, few who are willing to return without more
ado to the way of life of the deer and the stag. St. Aegidius, one of
St. Francis's most zealous companions, found fault with the ants
because they were too much preoccupied with collecting supplies;
he approved only of the birds, because they do not store food in
barns. For the birds in the air, the animals on earth, the fish in the
sea, are satisfied when they have sufficient nourishment. He himself
believed that he lived according to the same ideal when he fed himself
with the labour of his hands and the collection of alms. When he
went gleaning with the rest of the poor at harvest-time, and people
wanted to add to his gleanings, he would refuse saying: 'I have no
barn for storing. I do not wish for one.; Yet this saint did derive
advantages from the economic order he condemned. His life in
poverty, possible only in and by this economic order, was infinitely
better off than that of the fishes and birds he believed he was
imitating. He received income for his labour out of the stores of an
ordered economy. If others had not gathered in barns the saint
would have gone hungry. Only if everybody else had taken the
fishes as their example, could he have known what it was to live
like a fish. Critically disposed contemporaries recognized this. The
English Benedictine, Matthew Paris, reports that Pope Innocent III
advised St. Francis, after listening to his rule, to go to the swine,
whom he resembled more than men, to roll with them in the mud,
and to teach his rule to them. 1
Ascetic morals can never have universal application as binding
principles of life. The ascetic who acts logically passes voluntarily
out of the world. Asceticism which seeks to maintain itself on earth
does not carry its principles to the logical end; it stops at a certain
point. It is immaterial by what sophistry it tries to explain this; it is
sufficient that it does so and must do so. Moreover, it is compelled
at least to tolerate non-ascetics. By thus developing a double
morality, one for saints, one for worldlings, it splits ethics in two. The
lay life is, after all, tolerable and tolerated, but that is all. The only
truly moral folk are the monks, or whatever else they may be called,
1 Glaser, Diefran:mkanische Bewegung, Stuttgart und Berlin 1903, p. 53 et seq., 59.
406

ASCETICISM AND SOCIALISM

who strive for perfection by asceticism. By splitting morality in this
way asceticism renounces its claim to rule life. The only demand that
it still ventures to make upon laymen is for small donations to keep
the saint's body and soul together.
As a strict ideal, asceticism knows no satisfaction of wants at all.
It is therefore non-economic in the most literal sense. The watered­
down ideal of asceticism, conceived by the laymen of a society that
reveres the asceticism of the perfect, or by monks living in a self­
sufficient community, may demand only the most primitive hand to
mouth production, but it by no means opposes the extreme
rationalization of economic activity. On the contrary, it demands
this. For, since all preoccupation with worldly matters keeps people
away from the only purely moral way of life and is to be tolerated at
all only as a means to an intermediate purpose - unfortunately
unavoidable - then it is essential that this unholy activity should
be as economical as possible, so as to reduce it to a minimum.
Rationalization, desirable to the worldling in his efforts to reduce
painful and increase pleasant sensations, is imposed upon the ascetic,
to whom the painful sensations aroused by work and privation are
valuable castigations, because it is his duty to devote himself to the
transitory no longer than is absolutely necessary.
From the ascetic point of view too, therefore, socialistic produc­
tion cannot be preferred to the capitalistic unless it is held to be more
rational. Asceticism may recommend its devotees to limit the
activities by which they satisfy their wants because it abhors a too
comfortable existence. But within the limits which it leaves for the
satisfaction of these wants, it cannot regard as right anything but
what rational economy demands.

§2
Asceticism and Socialism
Socialist thought at first cold-shouldered all principles of
asceticism. It harshly rejected any consoling promise of a life after
death and aimed at an earthly paradise for everybody. Neither the
world to come nor any other religious inducements have any interest
for it. Socialism's one aim was to guarantee that everyone should
reach the highest standard of well-being attainable. Not self-denial,
407

SOC IALI S M AND ASCETI C I S M

but enjoyment was its criterion. Socialist leaders have always
definitely opposed all those who show themselves indifferent to the
increase in productivity. They have pointed out that, to lessen the
hardships of labour and increase the pleasures of e�joyment, the
productivity of human labour must be multiplied. The grandiose
gestures of degenerate scions of wealthy families in praise of the
charms of poverty and the simple life made no appeal to them.
But on looking into this more closely, wc may detect a gradual
change in their attitude. In proportion as the uneconomic nature of
socialistic production becomes apparent, socialists are beginning to
transform their views on the desirability of a more abundant satisfac­
tion of human wants. Many of them are even beginning to show
some sympathy with writers who praise the Middle Ages and look
with contempt on the riches which Capitalism adds to the means of
existence. I
The assertion that we could be happy, or even happier, with
fewer goods can no more be refuted than it can itself be proved. Of
course, most people imagine that they have not enough material
goods; and, because they value the increase of well-being that
greater exertions on their part can bring more than they value the
leisure which they would gain by renouncing it, they exhaust them­
selves by laborious work. But even if we admit the assertions of
those semi-ascetics whose outlook we have been discussing, this by
no means commits us to giving the socialist method of production
precedence over the capitalist. For supposing too many goods are
produced under Capitalism, the matter could be remedied quite
simply by reducing the quantity of work to be done. The demand
that we should reduce the productivity of labour by adopting a less
fruitful way of production cannot be justified by such arguments.

CHRI STIANITY AND SOCIALISM

I

§
Religion and social ethics

ELIGION, not merely as a church but as a philosophy too, is like
R any other fact of spiritual life, a product of men's social co­

operation. Our thinking is by no means an individual phenomenon
independent of all social relations and traditions; it has a social
character by reason of the very fact that it follows methods of thought
formed during millennia of co-operation between innumerable
groups. And we, again, are able to take over these methods of
thought only because we are members of society. Now, for exactly
the same reasons, we cannot imagine religion as an isolated phenom­
enon. Even the mystic, who forgets his surroundings in awestruck joy
as he experiences communion with his God, has not made his religion
by his own efforts. The forms of thought which have led him to it
are not his own individual creation; they belong to society. A Kaspar
Hauser cannot evolve a religion wi thout help from outside. Religion,
like everything else, has grbwn up historically, and is subject to the
constant change that affects every social phenomenon.
But religion is also a social factor in the sense that it regards social
relations from a special angle and sets up rules for human conduct in
society accordingly. It cannot refuse to state its principles in matters
of social ethics. No religion which sets out to give its devotees an
answer to the problems of life, and to console them where they most
need consolation, can rest content with interpreting the relations of
man to Nature, to becoming, and to passing away. If it leaves out
the relations of man to man, it can produce no rules for earthly
conduct but abandons the believer as soon as he starts thinking about
the inadequacy of social conditions. Religion must provide him an
answer when he asks why there are rich and poor, violence and
justice, war and peace, or it will force him to look for an answer
elsewhere. This would mean losing its hold on its adherents and its
409

CHR I ST IANITY AND SO CIALISM

power over the spirit. Without social ethics religion would be dead.
To-day the Islamic and Jewish religions are dead. They offer
their adherents nothing more than a ritual. They know how to
prescribe prayers and fasts, certain foods, circumcision and the rest;
but that is all. They offer nothing to the mind. Completely de­
spiritualized, all they teach and preach are legal forms and external
rule. They lock their follower into a cage of traditional usages, in
which he is often hardly able to breathe; but for his inner soul they
have no message. They suppress the soul, instead of elevating and
saving it. For many centuries in Islam, for nearly two thousand years
in Jewry, there have been no new religious movements. To-day the
religion of the Jews is just as it was when the Talmud was drawn up.
The religion of Islam has not changed since the days of the Arab
conquests. Their literature, their philosophies continue to repeat the
old ideas and do not penetrate beyond the circle of theology. One
iooks in vain among them for men and movements such as Western
Christianity has produced in each century. They maintain their
identity only by rejecting everything foreign and 'different', by
traditionalism and conservatism. Only their hatred of everything
foreign rouses them to great deeds from time to time. All new sects,
even the new doctrines which arise with them, are nothing more than
echoes of this fight against the foreign, the new, the infidel. Religion
has no influence on the spiritual life of the individual, where indeed
this is able to develop at all against the stifling pressure of rigid
traditionalism. We see this most clearly in the lack of clerical
influence. Respect for the clergy is purely superficial. In these
religions there is nothing which could be compared to the profound
influence which the clergy exercises in the Western Churches ­
though of a different order in each church; there is nothing to com­
pare to the Jesuit, the Catholic bishop, and the Protestant pastor.
There was the same inertia in the polytheistic religions of antiquity
and there still is in the Eastern Church. The Greek Church has been
dead for over a thousand years. 1 Only in the second half of the
nineteenth century did it once more produce a man in whom faith
and hope flared up like fire. But Tolstoy's Christianity, however
much it may bear a superficiaUy Eastern and Russian hue, is at
bottom founded on Western ideas. It is particularly characteristic

of this great Gospeller that, unlike the Italian merchant's son,
Francis of Assisi, or the German miner's son, Martin Luther, he did
not come from the people but from the nobility which, by upbringing
and education, had been completely Westernized. The Russian
Church proper has produced at most men like John of Kronstadt or
Rasputin.
These dead churches lack any special ethics. Harnack says of the
Greek Church: 1 'The real sphere of the working life whose morality
is to be regulated by the Faith, falls outside its direct observation.
This is left to the state and the nation.' But it is otherwise in the
living Church of the West. Here, where faith is not yet extinct, where
it is not merely external form that conceals nothing but the priest's
meaningless ritual; where, in a word, it grips the whole man, there
is continuous striving after a social ethic. Again and again do its
members go back to the Gospels
to renew their life in the Lord and
His Message.

§2
The Gospels as a source of Christian ethics
To the believer Holy Writ is the deposit of divine revelation,
God's word to humanity, which must for ever be the unshakable
foundation of all religion and all conduct controlled by it. This is
true not only of the Protestant, who accepts the teaching of the
pulpit only in so far as it can be reconciled with Holy Writ; it is
true also of the Catholics who, on the one hand, derive the authority
of Holy Writ from the Church, but, on the other, ascribe Holy Writ
itself to divine origin by teaching that it came into being with the
help of the Holy Ghost. The dualism here is resolved by entitling the
Church alone to make what is the finally authentic - infallible interpretation of Holy Writ. Both creeds assume the logical and
systematic unity of the whole of the sacred writings; to bridge over
the difficulties arising from this assumption must, therefore, be one
of the most important tasks of ecclesiastical doctrine and science.
Scientific research regards the writings of the Old and New
Testament as historical sources to be approached in the same manner
as all other historical documents. It breaks up the unity of the Bible
1 Hamack, Das Monchtum, p. 33.

41 I

CHRIST IANITY AND SOCIALISM

and tries to give each section its place in the history of literature.
Now, modern biblical research of this order is incompatible with
theology. The Catholic Church has recognized this fact but the
Protestant Church still tries to delude itself. It is senseless to recon­
struct the character of an historical Jesus in order to build up a
doctrine of faith and morals on the results. Efforts of this kind
hamper documentary research of a scientific kind by deflecting it
from its real aim and assigning to it tasks which it cannot fulfil
without introducing modern scales of value; moreover they are
contradictory in themselves. On the one hand they try to explain
Christ and the origin of Christianity historically; on the other, to
regard these historical phenomena as the eternal source from which
spring all the rules of ecclesiastical conduct, even in the totally
different world of to-day. What is it but a contradiction to examine
Christianity with the eye of a historian and then to seek a clue to the
present in the results of the study. History can never present
Christianity in its 'pure form', but only in its 'original form'. To
confuse the two is to shut one's eyes to two thousand years of develop­
ment. 1 The error into which many protestant theologians fall in
this matter is the same as that committed by a section of the historical
school oflaw when it attempted to impose the results of its researches
into the history of jurisprudence upon present-day legislation and
administration of justice. This is not the procedure of the true
historian but rather of one who denies all evolution and all possi­
bility of evolution. Contrasted with the absolutism of this point of
view, the absolutism of the much condemned 'shallow' eighteenth­
century rationalists, who stressed precisely this element of progress
and evolution, seems genuinely historical in its outlook.
The relation of Christian ethics to the problem of Socialism must
not therefore be viewed through the eyes of Protestant theologians
whose research is directed towards an unchangeable and immovable
'essence' of Christianity. If one looks on Christianity as a living, and
hence a constantly changing, phenomenon - a view not so incom­
patible with the outlook of the Catholic Church as one might at
first imagine - then one must decline a priori to inquire whether
Socialism or private property is more in keeping with its idea. The
best we can do is to pass the history of Christianity in review and
consider whether it has ever shown a bias in favour of this or that
1 Troeltsch. Gesammelte Schriften. Vol. Il. Tiibingen 1 9 1 3 . p. 386 et seq.

form of social organization. The attention we pay to the writings of
the Old and New Testament in the process is justified by their
importance even to-day as sources of ecclesiastical doctrine, but not
by the supposition that from them alone can one glean what
Christianity really is.
The ultimate aim of research of this kind should be to ascertain
whether, both now and in the future, Christianity must necessarily
reject an economy based on private property in the means of pro­
duction. This question cannot be settled merely by establishing the
fact, already familiar, that ever since its inception close on two
thousand years ago Christianity :bas found its own ways of coming
to terms with private property. For it might happen that either
Christianity or 'private property' should reach a point in its evolution
which renders the compatiblity of the two impossible - supposing
that it had ever existed.

§3
Primitive Christianity and society
Primitive Christianity was not ascetic. With a joyful acceptance
of life it deliberately pushed into the background the ascetic ideals
which permeated many contemporary sects. (Even John the Baptist
lived as an ascetic.) Only in the third and fourth centuries was
asceticism introduced into Christianity, from this time dates the
ascetic re-interpretation and reformation of gospel teachings. The
Christ of the Gospels enjoys life among his disciples, refreshes himself
with food and drink and shares the feasts of the people. He is as far
removed from asceticism and a desire to flee the world as he is from
intemperance and debauchery. 1 Alone his attitude to the relations
of the sexes strikes us as ascetic, but we can explain this, as we can
explain all practical Gospel Teachings - and they offer no rules of
life except practical ones - by the basic conception which gives us our
whole idea ofJesus, the conception of the Messiah.
'The Time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand : repent
ye, and believe the gospeL' These are the words with which, in the
Gospel of Mark, the Redeemer makes his entry! Jesus regards
1 Harnack, Das Wesen des Christentums, 55th thousand, Leipzig 1907, p. So et seq.

CHRISTIANITY AND SOCIALISM
himself as the prophet of the approaching Kingdom of God, the
Kingdom which according to ancient prophecy shall bring re­
demption from all earthly insufficiency, and with it from all economic
cares. His followers have nothing to do but to prepare themselves for
this Day. The time for worrying about earthly matters is past, for
now, in expectation of the Kingdom, men must attend to more
important things. Jesus offers no rules for earthly action and struggle;
his Kingdom is not of this world. Such rules of conduct as he gives
his followers are valid only for the short interval of time which has
still to be lived while waiting for the great things to come. In the
Kingdom of God there will be no economic cares. There the
believers will eat and drink at the Lord's table. 1 For this Kingdom
therefore, all economic and political counsel would be superfluous.
Any preparations made by Jesus must be regarded as merely
transitional expedients. a
It is oniy in this way that we can understand why, in the Sermon
on the Mount, Jesus recommends his own people to take no thought
for food, drink, and clothing; why he exhorts them not to sow or reap
or gather in barns, not to labour or spin. It is the only explanation,
too, of his and his disciples' 'communism'. This 'communism' is not
Socialism; it is not production with means of production belonging to
the community. It is nothing more than a distribution of consump­
tion goods among the members of the community - 'unto each,
according as any one had need'.' It is a communism of consumption
goods, not of the means of production, a community of consumers,
not of producers. The primitive Christians do not produce, labour,
or gather anything at all. The newly converted realize their posses­
sions and divide the proceeds with the brethren and sisters. Such a
way of living is untenable in the long run. It can be looked upon
only as a temporary order which is what it was in fact intended to
be. Christ's disciples lived in daily expectation of Salvation.
The primitive Christian's idea of imminent fulfilment transforms
itself gradully into that conception of the Last Judgment which lies
at the root of all ecclesiastical movements that have had any pro­
longed existence. Hand in hand with this transformation went the
entire reconstruction of the Christian ruies of iife. Expectation of the

coming of the Kingdom of God could no longer serve as a basis.
When the congregations sought to organize themselves for a pro­
longed life on earth they had to cease demanding that their members
should abstain from work and dedicate themselves to the contempla­
tive life in preparation for the Divine Kingdom. Not only did they
have to tolerate their brethren's participation in the world's work,
they had to insist upon it, as otherwise they would have destroyed
the conditions necessary to the existence of their religion. And thus,
Christianity, which began with complete indifference to all social
conditions, practically canonized the social order of the declining
Roman Empire once the process of adapting the Church to that
order had begun.
It is an error to speak of the social teachings of primitive Christi­
anity. The historical Christ and his teachings, as the oldest part of
the New Testament represents them; are quite indifferent to all soci al
considerations. Not that Christ did not sharply criticize the existing
state of affairs, but he did not think it worth while to consider how
matters could be improved or even to think about them at all. That
was God's affair. He would set up his own glorious and faultless
Kingdom, and its coming would be soon. Nobody knew what this
Kingdom would look like, but one thing was certain : in it one would
live carefree. Jesus omits all minuter details, and they were not
needed; for the Jews of his time did not doubt the splendour of life
in the Kingdom of God. The Prophets had announced this King­
dom and their words continued to live in the minds of the people,
forming indeed the essential content of their religious thought.
The expectation of God's own reorganization when the time
came and the exclusive transfer of all action and thought to the
future Kingdom of God, made Jesus�s teaching utterly negative. He
rejects everything that exists without offering anything to replace it.
He arrives at dissolving all existing social ties. The disciple shall not
merely be indifferent to supporting himself, shall not merely refrain
from work and dispossess himself of all goods, but he shall hate
'father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters,
yea, and his own Hfe' . 1 Jesus is able to tolerate the worldly laws of
the Roman Empire and the prescriptions of the Jewish Law because
he is indifferent to them, despising them as things important only
within the narrow limits of time and not because he acknowledges

their value. His zeal in destroying social ties knows no limits. The
motive force behind the purity and power of this complete negation is
ecstatic inspiration and enthusiastic hope of a new world. Hence his
passionate attack upon everything that exists. Everything may be
destroyed because God in His omnipotence will rebuild the future
order. No need to scrutinize whether anything can be carried over
from the old to the new order, because this new order will arise
without human aid. It demands therefore from its adherents no
system of ethics, no particular conduct in any positive direction.
Faith and faith alone, hope, expectation - that is all he needs. He
need contribute nothing to the reconstruction of the future, this God
Himself has provided for. The clearest modern parallel to the
attitude of complete negation of primitive Christianity is Bolshevism.
The Bolshevists, too, wish to destroy everything that exists because
they regard it as hopelessly bad. But they have in mind ideas,
indefinite and contradictory though they may be, of the future social
order. They demand not only that their followers shall destroy all
that is, but also that they pursue a definite line of conduct leading
towards the future Kingdom of which they have dreamt. Jesus's
teaching in this respect, on the other hand, is merely negation. 1
Jesus was no social reformer. His teachings had no moral applica­
tion to life on earth, and his instructions to the disciples only have a
meaning in the light of their immediate aim - to await the Lord
with girded loins and burning lamps, 'that when he cometh and
knocketh, they may straightaway open unto him'.1 It is just this
that has enabled Christianity to make its triumphant progress
through the world. Being neutral to any social system, it was able to
traverse the centuries without being destroyed by the tremendous
social revolutions which took place. Only for this reason could it
become the religion of Roman Emperors and Anglo-Saxon entre­
preneurs, of African negroes and European Teutons, medieval feudal
lords and modern industrial labourers. Each epoch and every party
has been able to take from it what they wanted, because it contains
nothing which binds it to a definite social order.

INTEREST

The canon law prohibition of interest
Each epoch has found in the Gospels what it sought to find there,
and has overlooked what it wished to overlook. This is best proved
by reference to the preponderant importance which ecclesiastical
social ethics for many centuries attached to the doctrine of usury. 1
The demand made upon Christ's disciples in the Gospels and other
writings of the New Testament is something very different from the
renunciation of interest on capital lent out. The canonic prohibition
of interest is a product of the medieval doctrine of society and trade,
and had originally nothing to do with Christianity and its teachings.
Moral condemnation of usury and the prohibition of interest pre­
ceded Christianity. They were taken over from the writers and the
legislators of antiquity and enlarged as the struggie between agri­
culturists and the rising merchants and tradesmen developed. Only
then did the people try to support them with quotations from Holy
Writ. The taking of interest was not opposed because Christianity
required it, but rather, because the public condemned it, people tried to
read into the Christian writings a condemnation of usury. For this
purpose the New Testament seemed at first to be useless, and
accordingly the Old Testament was drawn on. For centuries no one
thought of quoting any passage from the New Testament in support
of the prohibition. It was some time before the scholastic art of
interpretation succeeded in reading what it sought into that much
quoted passage from Luke, and so finding support in the Gospels from
the suppression of usury.· This was not until the beginning of the
twelfth century. Only after the decree of Urban III is that passage
quoted as proof of the prohibition.' The construction then put on
Luke's words was, however, quite untenable. The passage is certainly
not concerned with the taking of interest. It is possible that in the
1 'The doctrine of the medieval law of trade is rooted in the canonic dogma of the
barrenness of money and in the sum of corollaries which are to be understood under the
name of the Usury Law. The history of the trade law of those times cannot be any­
thing except the history of the rule of the doctrine of usury in legal doctrine. '

context of that passage M'Y)8ev «7t'e:AL�OV't'EC; may mean 'do not
count on the restitution of what is lent'. Or more probably: 'you
shall lend not only to the well-to-do, who can also lend to you at
some time, but also to him from whom there is no prospect of this,
to the poor'. 1
The great importance people attached to this passage contrasts
sharply with their disregard of other Gospel commands and pro­
hibitions. The medieval Church was intent on carrying the order
against usury to its logical conclusion, but it wilfully omitted to
enforce many clear and unambiguous commands of the Gospels with
a fraction of the energy devoted to stamping out this particular
practice. In the very same chapter of Luke other things are ordained
or forbidden in precise words. The Church has never, for example,
been seriously at pains to forbid a man who has been robbed from
demanding back his own, nor has it deprecated resistance to the
robber, nor tried to brand an act ofjudgment as an unchristian act.
Other injunctions of the Sermon on the Mount, such as indifference
to food and drink, have similarly never been whole-heartedly
enforced.'

§5
Christianity and property
Since the third century Christianity has always served simul­
taneously those who supported the social order and those who wished
to overthrow it. Both parties have taken the same false step of
appealing to the Gospels and have found Biblical passages to support
them. It is the same to-day: Christianity fights both for and against
Socialism.
But all efforts to find support for the institution of private property
generally, and for private ownership in the means of production in
particular, in the teachings of Christ are quite vain. No art of
interpretation can find a single passage in the New Testament that
could be read as upholding private property. Those who look for a
Biblical ukase must go back to the Old Testament, or content

themselves with disputing the assertion that communism prevailed
in the congregation of the early Christians. 1 No one has ever denied
that the Jewish community was familiar with private property, but
this brings us no further towards defining the attitude towards it of
primitive Christianity. There is as little proof that Jesus approved
the economic and political ideas of the Jewish Law as that he did not.
Christ does say, indeed, that he has not come to destroy the Law but
to fulfil it.' But this we should try to understand from the standpoint
which alone makes Jesus's work intelligible. The words can hardly
refer to the rules of the Mosaic Law, made for earthly life before the
coming of the Kingdom of God, since several of his commands are in
sharp contrast to that Law. We may admit that the reference to the
'communism' of the first Christians proves nothing in favour of
'the collectivist communism according to modern notions'" and
yet not deduce from this that Christ approved of property.'
One thing of course is dear, and no skiifui interpretation can
obscure it. Jesus's words are full of resentment against the rich, and
the Apostles are no meeker in this respect. The Rich Man is con­
demned because he is rich, the Beggar praised because he is poor.
The only reason why Jesus does not declare war against the rich and
preach revenge on them is that God has said : 'Revenge is mine.'
In God's Kingdom the poor shall be rich, but the rich shall be
made to suffer. Later revisers have tried to soften the words of
Christ against the rich, of which the most complete and powerful
version is found in the Gospel of Luke, but there is quite enough left
to support those who incite the world to hatred of the rich, revenge,
murder and arson. Up to the time of modern Socialism no move­
ment against private property which has arisen in the Christian

, Pfleiderer (Das Urchristentum, Vol. I, p. 651) explains Jesus' pessimistic judg­
ment of earthly possessions by the apocalyptic expectation of the near world catastrophe.
'Instead of trying to reinterpret and adapt His rigoristic expressions on this subject in
the sense of our modern social ethics, one should make oneself familiar, once and for
all, with the idea that Jesus did not appear as a rational moralist but as an enthusiastic
prophet of the impending Kingdom of God and has only thus become the source of
the religion of salvation. He who wants to make the eschatological enthusiasm of the
prophet dle direct L-"1d perrrUlnent authority for social eth,ics does just as wisely as he
who would wish to warm his hearth and cook his soup with the flames of a volcano.'

law by which one cannot well govern'. See Neumann, Geschichte des Wuchers in

world has failed to seek authority in Jesus, the Apostles, and the
Christian Fathers, not to mention those who, like Tolstoy, made the
Gospel resentment against the rich the very heart and soul of their
teaching. This is a case in which the Redeemer's words bore evil
seed. More harm has been done, and more blood shed, on account
of them than by the persecution ofheretics and the burning of witches.
They have always rendered the Church defenceless against all
movements which aim at destroying human society. The Church as
an organization has certainly always stood on the side of those who
tried to ward off communistic attack. But it could not achieve much
in this struggle. For it was continually disarmed by the words:
'Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the Kingdom of God.'
Nothing, therefore, is less tenable than the constantly repeated
assertion that religion, that is, the confession of the Christian Faith,
forms a defence against doctrines inimical to property, and that it
makes the masses unreceptive to the poison of social incitement.
Every church which grows up in a society built on private property
must somehow come to terms with private property. But considering
the attitude of Jesus to questions of social life, no Christian Church
can ever make anything more than a compromise here, a compromise
which is effective only as long as nobody insists on a literal interpreta­
tion of the words of the Scriptures. It would be foolish to maintain
that Enlightenment, by undermining the religious feeling of the
masses, had cleared the way for Socialism. On the contrary, it is
the resistance which the Church has offered to the spread of liberal
ideas which has prepared the soil for the destructive resentment of
modern socialist thought. Not only has the Church done nothing to
extinguish the fire, it has even blown upon the embers. Christian
Socialism grew up in the Catholic and Protestant countries, while the
Russian Church witnessed the birth of ToIs toy's teachings, which are
unequalled in the bitterness of their antagonism to society. True,
the official Church tried at first to resist these movements, but it had
to submit in the end, just because it was defenceless against the words
of the Scriptures.
The Gospels are not socialistic and not communistic. They are,
as we have seen, indifferent to an social questions on the one hand,
full of resentment against all property and against all owners on the
other. So it is that Christian doctrine, once separated from the
context in which Christ preached it - expectation of the imminent
420

C H R IST I A N ITY AND

P R O PERTY

Kingdom of God - can be extremely destructive. Never and
nowhere can a system of social ethics embracing social co-oper­
ation be built up on a doctrine which prohibits any concern for
sustenance and work, while it expresses fierce resentment against
the rich, preaches hatred of the family, and advocates voluntary
castration.
The cultural achievements of the Church in its centuries of
development are the work of the Church, not of Christianity. It is
an open question how much of this work is due to the civilization
inherited from the Roman state and how much to the idea of
Christian love completely transformed under the influence of the
Stoics and other ancient philosophers. The social ethics ofJesus have
no part in this cultural development. The Church's achievement in
this case was to render them harmless, but always only for a limited
period of time. Since the Church is obliged to maintain the Gospels
as its foundation, it must aiways be prepared for a revoit on the part
of those among its members who put on Christ's words an interpre­
tation different from that ordained by the Church.
Social ethics applicable to earthly life can never be derived from
the words of the Gospels. It matters little whether they are a true
and just report of what, as a matter of history, Jesus taught. For to
every Christian Church these, together with the other books of the
New Testament, must represent the foundation without which its
essential character is destroyed. Even should historical research
show, with a high degree of probability, that the historical Jesus
thought and spoke about human society otherwise than he is made
to do in the New Testament, its doctrines would still remain
unaltered for the Church. For the Church, that which is written in
the New Testament must for ever remain the Word of God. Here,
apparently, only two things are possible. Either the Church may
renounce, in the manner of the Eastern Church, the responsibility of
taking up any attitude to the problems ofsocial ethics, at which point
it ceases to be a moral force and limits itself to purely decorative
action in life. Or it may follow the other path taken by the Western
Church, which has always incorporated in its teachings those social
ethics which best served its interests at the moment and its position
in state and society. It has allied itself with the feudal lords against
the serfs, it has supported the slave-economy of American planta­
tions, but it has also - in the case of Protestantism and especially in
42 1

C H R I ST IANITY AND S O C I A L I S M

Calvinism - made the morals of the rising Rationalism its own. It
has promoted the struggle of the Irish tenants against the English
aristocrats, it has fought with the Catholic trade unions against the
entrepreneurs, and with the conservative governments against social
democracy. And in each case it has been able to justify its attitude
by quotations from the Bible. This too amounts in fact to an abdica­
tion by Christianity in the field of social ethics, for the Church
becomes thus a volitionless tool in the hands of time and fashion. But
what is worse: it attempts to base each phase of partisanship on the
teaching of the Gospels and in this way encourages every movement
to seek scriptural justification for its ends. Considering the character
of the scriptural passages so exploited, it is clear that the more
destructive doctrines are bound to win.
But even if it is hopeless to try to build up an independent
Christian social ethic on the Gospels, might it not be possible to
bring Christian doctrines into harmony with a social ethic that
promotes social life instead of destroying it, and thus to utilize the
great forces of Christianity in the service of Civilization? Such a
transformation would not be unprecedented in history. The Church
is now reconciled to the fact that modern research has exploded the
fallacies of the Old and New Testaments with regard to natural
science. J t no longer burns at the stake heretics who maintain that
the world moves in space, or institutes inquisitional proceedings
against the man who dares to doubt the raising of Lazarus and the
bodily resurrection of the dead. Even priests of the Church of Rome
are to-day permitted to study astronomy and the history of evolu­
tion. Might not the same be possible then in sociology? Might not
the Church reconcile itself with the social principle offree co-opera­
tion by the division of labour? Might not the very principle of
Christian love be interpreted to this end?
These are questions which interest not only the Church. The fate
of Civilization is involved. For it is not as if the resistance of the
Church to liberal ideas was harmless. The Church is such a tre­
mendous power that its enmity to the forces which bring society into
existence would be enoullh to break our whole culture into frallments.
In the last decades we have witnessed with horror its terribl� trans­
formation into an enemy of society. For the Church, Catholic as
well as Protestant, is not the least of the factors responsible for the
prevalence of destructive ideals in the world to-day; Christian

Socialism has done hardly less than atheist socialism to bring about
the present state of confusion.

§6
Christian Socialism
Historically it is easy to understand the dislike which the Church
has shown for economic liberty and political Liberalism in any form.
Liberalism is the flower of that rational enlightenment which dealt
a death blow to the regime of the old Church and from which modern
historical criticism has sprung. It was Liberalism that undermined
the power of the classes that had for centuries been closely bound up
with the Church. It transformed the world more than Christianity
had ever done. It restored humanity to the world and to life. It
awakened forces which shook the foundations of the inert traditional­
ism on which Church and creed rested. The new outlook caused the
Church great uneasiness, and it has not yet adjusted itself to even the
externals of the modern epoch. True, the priests in Catholic countries
sprinkle holy water on newly laid railways and dynamos of new
power stations, but the professed Christian still shudders inwardly at
the workings of a civilization which his faith cannot grasp. The
Church strongly resented modernity and the modern spirit. What
wonder, then, that it allied itself with those whom resentment had
driven to wish for the break-up of this wonderful new world, and
feverishly explored its well-stocked arsenal for the means to denounce
the earthly struggle for work and wealth. The religion which called
itself the religion of love became a religion of hatred in a world that
seemed ripe for happiness. Any would-be destroyers of the modern
social order could count on finding a champion in Christianity.
It is tragic that it should have been just the greatest minds of the
Church, those who realized the significance of Christian love and
acted on it, who took part in this work of destruction. Priests and
monks who practised true Christian charity, ministered and taught
in hospitals and prisons and knew all there was to know about
suffering and sinning humanity - these were the first to be ensnared
by the new gospel of social destruction. Only a firm grasp of liberal
philosophy could have inoculated them against the infectious resent­
ment which raged among their proteges and was justified by the
42 3

CHRISTIANITY AND SOCIALISM

Gospels. As it was, they became dangerous enemies of society. From
the work of charity sprang hatred of society.
Some of these emotional opponents of the liberal economic
orders stopped short at open opposition. Many, however, became
socialists - not, of course, atheistical socialists like the proletarian
social-democrats, but Christian Socialists. And Christian Socialism
is none the less Socialism.
It was no less a mistake for Socialism to seek a parallel with itself in
the early centuries ofthe Christian Era as in the first congregation. Even
the 'consumers' communism' of that early congregation vanished
when expectation of the coming of the Kingdom began to recede into
the background. Socialist methods of production did not, however,
replace it in the community. What the Christians produced, was
produced by the individual within his own farm or shop. The
revenues which provided for the needy and met the cost of joint
activities came from contributions, voluntary or compulsory, of
members of the congregation, who produced on their own account
with their own means of production. A few isolated instances of
socialist production may have occurred in the Christian congrega­
tions of the first centuries, but there is no documentary evidence of
it. There was never a teacher of Christianity, whose teachings and
writings are known to us, who recommended it. We often find the
Apostolic Fathers and the Fathers of the Church, exhorting their
followers to return to the communism of the first congregation, but
this is always a communism of consumption. They never recommend
the socialistic organization of production. 1
The best known of these exhortations in praise of communism is
that ofJohn Chrysostom. In the eleventh of his homilies to the Acts
of the Apostles the Saint applauds the consumers' communism of the
first Christian congregation, and with all his fiery eloquence advo­
cates its revival. Not only does he recommend this form of
communism by reference to the example of the Apostles and their
contemporaries, but tries to set forth rationally the advantages of
communism as he conceives it. If all the Christians of Constantinople
were to hand over their possessions to a common ownership, then so
much would be amassed that all the Christian poor could be fed
and no one would suffer want, for the costs of joint living are far
smaller than those of single households. Here St. Chrysostom
1 Seipel. Die wirtschaftsethischen Lehren der Kirchenvdter. Vienna 1907. p. 84 et seq.
424

CHRISTIAN

SO CIALI S M

adduces arguments similar to those brought forward to-day by
people who advocate one-kitchen houses or communal kitchens and
try to prove arithmetically the economies which a concentration of
cooking and housekeeping would achieve. The costs, says this
Father of the Church, would not be large, and the enormous fund
which would be amassed by uniting the goods of individuals would
be inexhaustible, especially as God's blessings would then be poured
yet more lavishly on the faithful. Moreover, every newcomer would
have to add something to the general fund. 1 These sober, matter of
fact expositions show us that what Chrysostom had in mind was
merely joint consumption.

His comments on the economic ad­

vantages of unification, culminating in the statement that division
into fragments leads to diminution, while unity and co-operation
lead to increase, of well-being, do credit to their author's economic
perception. On the whole, however, his proposals reveal a complete
lack of understanding of the problem of production. His thoughts are
directed exclusively to consumption. That production comes before
consumption had never occurred to him. All goods were to be
transferred to the community (St. Chrysostom presumably thinks
here of their sale, following the example of the Gospels and the Acts
of the Apostles) after which the community was to begin consuming
in common. He had not realized that this could not go on for
ever. He believed that the millions which would be gathered to­
gether - he estimates the treasure at between one and three million
pounds weight of gold - could never be used up. One notices that
the saint's economic insight ends just where the wisdom of our
social politicians also tends to end, when they try to reorganize
the whole national economy in the light of experience gained in
charitable work in the field of consumption.
St. Chrysostom explains that people fear to risk the change to the
communism, which he recommends, more than a plunge into the
ocean. And so the Church, too, soon dropped the communistic idea.
For monastic economy cannot be regarded as Socialism. Mon­
astries which could not subsist on private donations usually lived
on the tithes and dues of rent-paying peasants and the yields of
farnls and other property. Veri occasionally the monks therrlSelves
worked, on a sort of producers' co-operative basis. The whole
monastic existence is an ideal of life accessible only to the few, and
1 Migne. PatrologUu Graecae, Val.
425

I. p. 96

et seq.

CHRI STIANITY AND SOCIALISM

monastic production can never be taken as a standard for the whole
commonwealth. Socialism, on the other hand, is a general economic
system.
The roots of Christian Socialism are found neither in the primitive
nor in the medieval Church. It was the Christianity that emerged
revitalized from the tremendous struggles of faith in the sixteenth
century which first adopted it, though only gradually and in the
face of strong opposition.
The modern Church differs from the medieval Church in that
it has continually to fight for its existence. The medieval Church
ruled unchallenged; all that men thought, taught, or wrote emanated
from it and eventually returned to it. The spiritual inheritance of
classic antiquity could not shake its dominion, for its ultimate mean­
ing was beyond the understanding of a generation cramped by
feudal concepts and ideas. But in proportion as social evolution pro­
gressed in the direction of rational thought and action, men's efforts
to shake off the fetters of traditional thought in respect of ultimate
truths became more successful. The Renaissance strikes at the root
of Christianity. Based on classical reasoning and classical art, its
influence inevitably tended to lead away from the Church or at best
to leave it out of account. Far from trying to stem the tide, church­
men became the most zealous protagonists of the new spirit. At the
beginning of the sixteenth century no one was further removed from
Christianity than the Church itself. The last hour of the old faith
seemed to have sounded.
Then came the great revulsion, the Christian counter-revolution.
It did not come from above, from the princes of the Church or from
the monasteries, in fact it did not come from the Church at all. It
was forced upon the Church from outside, springing from the depths
of the people where Christianity still survived as an inner force. The
assault on the moribund Church with a view to its reformation came
thus from outside and below. The reformation and the counter­
reformation are the two great expressions of this ecclesiastical re­
birth. They differ in origin and in method, in their forms of worship
and prescribed doctrines, above all in their presuppositions and
achievements in political affairs; but they are at one in their ultimate
aim: to base the world order once more on the Gospels, to reinstate
faith as a power controlling the minds and hearts of men. It is the
greatest revolt of faith against thought, of tradition against philo42 6

C HR I S T I A N

SOCIALISM

sophy known to history. Its successes were enormous, and it created
Christianity as we know it to-day, the religion that has its seat in the
heart of the individual, which controls conscience and comforts the
soul. But complete victory has been denied it. Though it warded
off defeat - the fall of Christianity - it could not destroy the enemy.
For ever since the sixteenth century this struggle of ideas has been
pursued almost without intermission.
The Church knows that it cannot win unless it can seal the fount
from which its opponent continues to draw inspiration. As long as
rationalism and the spiritual freedom of the individual are main­
tained in economic life, the Church will never succeed in fettering
thought and shepherding the intellect in the desired direction. To
do this it would first have to obtain supremacy over all human
activity. Therefore it cannot rest content to live as a free Church
in a free state; it must seek to dominate that state. The Papacy of
Rome and the Protestant national churches both fight for such
dominion as would enable them to order all things temporal accord­
ing to their ideals. The Church can tolerate no other spiritual power.
Every independent spiritual power is a menace to it, a menace which
increases in strength as the rationalization of life progresses.
Now independent production does not tolerate any spiritual
over-lordship. In our day, dominion over the mind can only be
obtained through the control of production. All Churches have long
been dimly aware of this, but it was first made clear to them when the
socialist idea, rising from an independent source, made itself felt
as a powerful and rapidly growing force. It then dawned upon the
Churches that theocracy is only possible in a socialist community.
On one occasion this idea was actually realized. This was when
the Society of Jesus created that remarkable state in Paraguay,
which was not unlike an embodiment of the ideal Republic of Plato.
This unique state flourished for more than a century, when it was
destroyed by external forces. It is certain that the Jesuits did not
found this society with the idea of making a social experiment or of
setting up an example for other communities of the world. But ulti­
mately they were aiming in Paraguay at no more than what they
have everywhere tried to achieve, but without SUCCeSS, on account of
the great resistance encountered. They have tried to bring laymen as children needing the guardianship of the Church - under the
beneficent government of the Church and of their own Order.
42 7

C H R I S TIANITY AND SO C I A L I S M

Neither the Jesuit order nor any other ecclesiastical body has since
tried anything like the Paraguayan experiment. But it is plain that
all Western Churches, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, are
aiming at the same goal. Remove all the obstacles which hamper the
Church to-day, and nothing will prevent it from repeating the
Paraguayan achievement everywhere.
That the Church, generally speaking, takes up a negative attitude
to socialist ideas does not disprove the truth of these arguments. It
opposes any Socialism which is to be effected on any other basis than
its own. It is against Socialism as conceived by atheists, for this
would strike at its very roots; but it has no hesitation in approaching
socialist ideals provided this menace is resumed. The Prussian
Church stands at the head of Prussian State Socialism and the Roman
Catholic Church everywhere pursues its special Christian social
ideal.
In face of all this evidence, it would seem that only a negative
answer can be made to the question asked above: whether it might
not be possible to reconcile Christianity with a free social order based
on private ownership in the means of production. A living Chris­
tianity cannot, it seems, exist side by side with Capitalism. Just as in
the case of Eastern religions, Christianity must either overcome
Capitalism or go under. Yet, in the fight against Capitalism to-day,
there is no more effective war-cry than Socialism, now that sug­
gestions of a return to the medieval social order find few supporters.
But there may be an alternative. No one can foresee with cer­
tainty how Church and Christianity may change in the future.
Papacy and Catholicism now face problems incomparably more
difficult than all those they have had to solve for over a thousand
years. The world-wide Universal Church is threatened in its very
being by Chauvinist nationalism. By refineHlent of political art it
has succeeded in maintaining the principle of Catholicism through
all the turmoil of national wars, but it must realize more clearly
every day that its continuance is incompatible with nationalist ideas.
Unless it is prepared to succumb, and make way for national
churches, it must drive out nationalism by an ideology which makes
it possible for nations to live and work together in peace. But in
so doing the Church would find itself inevitably committed to
Liberalism. No other doctrine would serve.
If the Roman Church is to find any way out of the crisis into
428

C H R I S T IAN

S O C IA L I SM

which nationalism has brought it, then it must be thoroughly trans­
formed. It may be that this transformation and reformation will lead
to its unconditional acceptance of the indispensability of private
ownership in the means of production. At present it is still far from
this, as witness the recent encyclica Quadragesimo anno.

NGELS called the German Labour Movement the heir to the

that German (not only Marxian) Socialism represents the decadence

of the school of idealist philosophy. Socialism owes the dominion it

won over the German mind to the idea of society as conceived by the
great German thinkers. Out of Kant's mysticism of duty and Hegel's
deification of the State it is easy to trace the development of socialist
thought; Fichte is already a socialist.
In recent decades the revival of Kantian criticism, that much
praised achievement of German philosophy, has benefited Socialism
also. The Neo-Kantians, especially Friedrich Albert Lange and
Hermann Cohen, have declared themselves socialists. Simul­
taneously marxians have tried to reconcile Marxism with the New
Criticism. Ever since the philosophical foundations of Marxism
have shown signs of cracking, attempts to find in critical philosophy
support for socialist ideas have multiplied.
The weakest part of Kant's system is his ethics. Although they
are vitalized by his mighty intellect, the grandeur of individual
concepts does not blind us to the fact that his starting-point is un­
fortunately chosen and his fundamental conception a mistaken one.
His desperate attempt to uproot Eudemonism has failed. In ethics,
Bentham, Mill, and Feuerbach triumph over Kant. The social
philosophy of his contemporaries, Ferguson and Adam Smith, left
him untouched. Economics remained foreign to him. All his
perception of social problems suffers from these deficiencies.
In this respect, Neo-Kantians have made no better progress than
their master. They, too, lack insight into the fundamental social law

of the division of labour. They only see that the distribution of
income does not correspond to their ideal, that the largest incomes
do not go to those whom they consider the most deserving, but to a
class they despise. They see people poor and in want, but do not
try to discover whether this is due to the institution of private pro­
perty or to attempts to restrict it. And they promptly condemn the
institution of private ownership itself, for which they - living far
away from the troubles of business - never had any sympathies. In
social cognition they remain bound to the external and sympto­
matic. They tackle all other problems without a qualm, but here
timidity restrains them. In their embarrassment, they betray their
underlying bias. In social philosophy it is often difficult for thinkers
who are otherwise quite open-minded to avoid all resentment. Into
their thoughts obtrudes the recollection of those more prosperous
than themselves ; they make comparisons between their own value
and the lack of it in others on the one hand, and their own poverty'
and the wealth of others on the other. In the end anger and envy,
rather than reason, guide their pen.
This alone explains why such lucid thinkers as the Neo-Kantians
have not yet clearly thought out the only salient problems in social
philosophy. Not even the rudiments of a comprehensive social
philosophy are to be found in their works. They make numerous
unfounded criticisms of certain social conditions, but omit to discuss
the most important systems of sociology. They judge, without having
first made themselves familiar with the results of economic science.
The starting-point of their Socialism is generally the sentence:
'Act in such a way that you use your being, equally with the being
of anyone else, always as a purpose, never merely as a means.' In
these words, says Cohen, 'the most profound and powerful meaning of
the categoric imperative is expressed: they contain the moral programme
of the modern age and of all future world history.' 1 And from that to
Socialism, he seems to infer, is no great distance. 'The idea of the
purpose preference of humanity becomes transformed into the idea
of Socialism by the definition of every individual as ultimate purpose,
an end in himself."
It is evident that this ethical argument for Socialism stands or
falls by the assertion that in the economic order based on private
ownership in the means of production all men, or some men, are

means and not purpose. Cohen considers this to be completely
proved. He believes that in such a social order two classes of men
exist, owners and non-owners, of whom only the first lead an exis­
tence worthy of a human being, while the second merely serve.
It is easy to see where this notion comes from. It rests on popular
ideas on the relations of rich and poor, and is supported by the
Marxian social philosophy, for which Cohen professes great sym­
pathy without, however, making his views about it clear. 1 Cohen
completely ignores the liberal social theory. He takes it for granted
that this is untenable, and thinks that it would be a waste of time to
criticize it. Yet only by refuting the liberal, views of the nature of
society and the function of private property could he justify the
assertion that in a society based on private ownership in the means
of production men serve as means, not as ends. For liberal social
theory proves that each single man sees in all others, first of all, only
means to the realization of his purposes, while he himself is to all
others a means to the realization of their purposes; that finally, by
this reciprocal action, in which each is simultaneously means and
end, the highest aim of social life is attained - the achievement of a
better existence for everyone. As society is only possible if everyone,
while living his own life, at the same time helps others to live, if
every individual is simultaneously means and end; ifeach individual's
well-being is simultaneously the condition necessary to the well-being
of the others, it is evident that the contrast between I and thou,
means and end, automatically is overcome. This, after all, is just
what the simile of the biological organism is supposed to make us
perceive. In the organic structure no parts are to be regarded only
as means and none only as ends. According to Kant the organism
is a being 'in which everything is end and reciprocally also means' . a
Now Kant was thoroughly familiar with the nature of the organic,
but he did not see - and in this he lagged far behind the great
sociologists who were his contemporaries - that human society is
formed according to the same principle.
1 'The direct purpose of capitalist production is not the production of goods but of
surplus value, or of profit in its developed form; not of the product but of the surplus
product . . . In this view the worken themseives appear as what, in the capitalist pro­
duction, they are - mere means of production, not ends in themselves, not purpose of
production.' (Marx, Thet»Vn iiber den Mehnoert, Stuttgart 1905, Part z, p. 333 et leg.)

The teleological view, which differentiates means and end, is
permissible only in so far as we make the will and action ofindividual
men or individual human associations the subject of investigation. It
ceases to have any meaning as soon as we go further and look at the
effects of this action in society. For every individual who acts there
exists an ultimate purpose, the purpose which Eudemonism enables
us to understand ; in this sense one may say that every man is an end
to himself and an end in himself. But as an observation applied to
the whole of society, this mode of expression is without any cognitive
value. Here we cannot speak of purpose with more justification
than of any other phenomenon of nature. When we ask whether,
in society, this or that is end or means, we mentally substitute for
society - that is, for the structure of human co-operation held to­
gether by the superiority of the division of labour over isolated
labour - a structure welded to�ether by' one will, and then ask what
is the aim of this will. This is a;imistic thought; it is not in any way
sociological or scientific.
Cohen's special argument for the abolition of private property
reveals the obscurity in which he still labours with regard to this
fundamental problem of social life. Things, he says, have value.
Persons, however, have no value. They have dignity. The market
price of the value of labour is incompatible with the dignity of the
person. 1 This leads us into the abyss of Marxian phraseology and
the doctrine of the 'commodity-character' of labour and its
objectionableness. This is the phrase which found its way into the
treaties of Versailles and St. Germain in the form of a demand for
the acceptance of the basic principle: 'that labour should not be
regarded merely as an article of commerce'.' Enough, however, of
these scholastic trivialities.
After this we need not be surprised to find repeated in Cohen all
those catchwords which for thousands of years have been brought to
bear against the institution of private property. He rejects property
because the owner, by getting control over an isolated action, be­
comes in fact the owner of the person.' He rejects property because
it withdraws from the worker the produce of his labour.'

Clearly the argument for Socialism presented by the Kantian
school always leads us back to the economic concepts of the various
socialistic writers; above all to Marx and the 'academic' socialists
who followed in his steps. They have no arguments other than
economIC and sociological arguments, and these prove to be un­
tenable.
§2
The duty of work as a foundation for Socialism
'If any will not work, neither let him eat', says the Second Epistle
to the Thessalonians, which was ascribed to the Apostle Paul. 1
This admonition to work is directed to those who want to live on
their Christianity at the expense of the working members of the
congregation ; they are to support themselves without burdening
their fellows.' Torn out of its context, this has long been interpreted
as a rejection of unearned income.' It contains a most succinctly
expressed moral precept which is continually being advocated with
great vigour.
The train of thought which has led people to this principle can
be followed in a saying of Kant: 'Man may be as ingenious as he
will, yet he cannot force Nature to accept other laws. Either he must
work himself or others for him, and this labour will rob others of as
much of their happiness as he needs to increase his own above the
mean."
It is important to note that Kant cannot base the indirect rejec­
tion of private property which lies in these words otherwise than on a
utilitarian or eudemonistic view. The conception from which he pro­
ceeds is that through private property more work is laid on some,
while others are allowed to idle. This criticism is not proof against
the objection that private ownership and the differences in the

people try to justify from the New Testament modern catchwords of the anti-liberal
movement.

amount of property do not take anything from anyone, that, rather,
in a social order where neither were permitted so much less would
be produced, that the per capita quota of the product of labour
would amount to less than what the propertyless worker receives as
income in a social order based on private property. It collapses as
soon as one disproves the statement that the leisure of the possessors
is bought by the extra efforts of those without possessions. Such
ethical judgments against private property also show clearly that all
moral evaluation of economic functions rests ultimately on a view
of their economic achievements - on that and nothing else. To
reject on 'moral grounds' only an institution not considered objection­
able from the utilitarian standpoint is, if we look more closely, not
the aim of ethical considerations. Actually, in all such cases the only
difference of opinion is a difference of opinion about the economic
function of such institutions.
That this fact has been overlooked is because those who tried to
refute ethical criticism of private property have used the wrong
arguments. Instead of pointing out its social significance they have
usually been content to demonstrate the right of ownership or to
prove that the owner, too, is not inactive, since he has worked to
acquire his property and works to maintain it, and other arguments
of this nature. The unsoundness of all this is obvious. It is absurd to
refer to existing law when the problem is what the law should be; to
refer to work which the owner does or has done when the problem is,
not whether a certain kind of work should or should not be paid for,
but whether private property in the means of production is to exist
at all, and, if it exists, whether inequality of such ownership can be
tolerated.
Therefore, from the ethical point of view, one is not permitted
to ask whether a certain price is justified or not. Ethical judgment has
to choose between a social order resting on private ownership in the
means of production and one based on common ownership. Once it
has arrived at this decision - which, for eudemonistic ethics, can be
based only upon an opinion of what each of the two imagined forms
of society would achieve - it cannot proceed to call immoral single
consequences of the order it has selected. That which is necessary
to the social order it has chosen is moral, and everything else is
immoral.
435

ETHICAL SOCIALISM

§3
The equaliry of incomes as an ethical postulate
Against the assertion that all men should have equal incomes, as
little can be said scientifically as can be said in support of it. Here is
an ethical postulate which can only be evaluated subjectively. All
science can do is to show what this aim would cost us, what other
aims we should have to forego in striving to attain this one.
Most people who demand the greatest possible equality of in­
comes do not realize that what they desire would only be achieved
by sacrificing other aims. They imagine that the sum of incomes
will remain unchanged and that all they need to do is to distribute
it more equally than it is distributed in the social order based on
private property. The rich will give as much as they receive over
and above the average, and the poor receive as much as is needed to
make up their incomes to the average. But the average income itself
will remain unchanged. It must be clearly understood, however,
that this idea rests on a grave error. It has been shown that, in what­
ever way one envisages the equalization of incomes this must always
and necessarily lead to a very considerable reduction of the total
national income and, thus, also, of the average income. On this
showing, the matter takes on quite a different complexion. For we
have then to decide whether we are in favour of an equal distribution
of income at a lower average income, or inequality of incomes at a
higher average income.
The decision will depend, of course, essentially, on how high one
estimates the reduction which alteration in the social distribution of
income will cause. If we conclude that the average income will be
lower than that received to-day by the poorest, our attitude will pro­
bably be quite different from the attitude of most socialists of the
sentimental type. If we accept what has been said in the second
part of the book about low productivity under Socialism and especially
the contention that economic calculation would be quite impossible,
then this argument of ethical Socialism also collapses.
It is untrue that some are poor because others are rich. 1 If a

order of society in which incomes were equal replaced the capitalist
order, everyone would become poorer. Paradoxical though it may
sound, the poor receive what they do only because rich people exist.
And if we reject the argument for the general conscription of
labour and for equality of wealth and incomes which is based on
the statement that some have their leisure and fortune at the expense
of the increased labour and poverty of others, then there remains no
basis for these ethical postulates except resentment. No one shall be
idle if ! have to work; no one shall be rich if! am poor. Thus we see,
again and again, that resentment lies behind all socialist ideas.

§4
The ethical-aesthetic condemnation of the profit-motive

Another reproach which philosophers level against the capitalist
economic order is that it encourages rank over-development of the
acquisitive instinct. Man, they say, is no longer lord of the economic
process, but its slave. That economic activity exists merely to satisfy
wants and is a means, not an end in itself, has been forgotten. Life
wears itself out in the perpetual hurry and scurry to get rich, and
men have no time left for inner composure and real enjoyment.
They lay waste their hest powers in the exhausting daily struggle of
free competition. And the ideologists look back into a distant past,
where all is romantically transfigured. They see the Roman
patrician at his country seat, meditating peacefully on the problems
of the stoa; the medieval monk dividing his hours between devotion
and the classics; the prince of the Renaissance at whose court artists
and scholars meet; the Rococo lady in whose salon the encyclo­
pedists develop their ideas - marvellous pictures, these, which pro­
duce in us a deep longing for the past. And our loathing for the
present deepens when we turn from these visions to the life led by
those who lack culture in our own time.
The weakness of this argument, which appeals to the feelings
rather than to the mind, is not only that it contrasts the brightest
flowers of all times and peoples with the weeds of modem life. It is
clear that one cannot compare the life of a Pericles or Maecenas with
the life of the ordinary man in the street. But it is still quite untrue
that the haste of modem business life has killed man's sense of the
beautiful and the sublime. The wealth of the 'bourgeois' civilization
43 7

ETHI CAL SOCIALISM

is not spent on base enjoyments alone. If argument be necessary,
one need only point to the way in which serious music has become
popular in the last decades, particularly among that class of the
population which is caught in the whirl of business life. There never
has been a time when art was closer to the heart of large circles of
the people. It is no phenomenon peculiar to our time that coarse
and vulgar amusements appeal more to the great mass of the people
than nobler forms of enjoyment. It was always so. And we may
take it that in the socialist community good taste will not always
predominate.
Modern man has always before his eyes the possibility of growing
rich by work and enterprise. In the more rigid economy of the past
this was less easy. People were rich or poor from birth, and remained
so through their lives unless they were given a change of position
through some unforeseen accident, which their own work or enter­
prise could not have caused or avoided. Accordingiy, we had the
rich walking on the heights and the poor who stayed in the depths.
It is not so in capitalist society. The rich can more easily become
poor and the poor can more easily become rich. And because every
individual is not born with, as it were, his own or his family fate
sealed, he tries to rise as high as he can. He can never be rich
enough, because in capitalist society no wealth is eternal. In the
past nobody could touch the feudal landlord. When his lands
became less fertile he had less to consume, but as long as he did not
get into debt he stayed on his property. The capitalist who lends
out his capital and the entrepreneur who produces must stand the
test of the market. Whoever invests unwisely, or produces too
dearly, is ruined. Unhampered seclusion from the market no longer
exists. Even landed fortunes cannot escape its influences; agricul­
ture, too, must produce capitalistically. To-day a man must earn
or become poor.
Let those who wish to eliminate this coercion to work and enter­
prise understand quite clearly that they are proposing to undermine
the foundations of our well-being. That in 1 9 1 4 the earth nourished
far more human beings than ever before, and that they all lived far
better than their ancestors, was due entirely to the acquisitive
instinct. If the diligence of modern industry were replaced by the
contemplative life of the past, unnumbered millions would be
doomed to death by starvation.
438

ACHIEVEMENTS OF CAPITALISM

In the socialist society the lordly ease of government offices will
take the place of the keen activity of modern financial houses and
factories. The civil servant will supplant the energetic entrepreneur.
Whether civilization will gain by it, we leave to the self-constituted
judges of the world and its institutions to decide. Is the bureaucrat
really the ideal human type, and must we aspire to fill the world with
his kind at any price?
Many socialists describe with great enthusiasm the advantages of
a society of civil servants over a society of profit-seekers. 1 In a society
ofthe latter kind (the Acquisitive Society), every one pursues only his
own advantage; in the society of those devoted to their profession
(the Functional Society) everyone does his duty in the service of the
whole. This higher evaluation of officialdom, in so far as it does not
rest on a misconception of the social order based on private owner­
ship in the means of production, is merely a new form of that
contempt for the work of the painstaking citizen in which feudal
landowners, soldiers, literary men, and bohemians have always
indulged.

§5
The cultural achievements of Capitalism
The inexactness and untruthfulness of ethical Socialism, its
logical inconsistencies and its lack of scientific criticism, characterize
it as the philosophic product of a period of decay. It is the spiritual
expression of the decline of European civilization at the turn of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Under its sway the German
people and with them the whole of humanity were swept from the
height of their culture to their deepest degradation. It created the
mental premises for the World War and for Bolshevism. Its theories
of violence were triumphant in the carnage of 1 9 14-18, which
brought to a close the finest flowering of civilization that world
history has ever known.
In Ethical Socialism imperfect understanding of human social
co-operation is combined with the resentment of the ne'er-do-well.
It is the inability to understand the difficult problems of social life

ETH I CAL SOCIALISM

which renders ethical socialists so unsophisticated and so certain that
they are competent to solve social problems offhand. Resentment
strengthens that indignation which is always sure of a response from
those of like mind. But the fire of their language comes from a
romantic enthusiasm for unrestraint. In every man there is a deep­
rooted desire for freedom from social ties; this is combined with a
longing for conditions which fully satisfy all imaginable wishes and
needs. Reason teaches us not to give way to the first unless we are
prepared to sink back into the deepest misery, and reminds us further
that the second cannot be fulfilled. Where reason ceases to function
the way to romanticism is open. The anti-social in man triumphs
over the mind.
The romantic movement, which addresses itself above all to the
imagination, is rich in words. The colourful splendour of its dreams
cannot be surpassed. Its praises awaken infinite longing, its curses
breed loathing and contempt. Its longing is directed towards a past
envisaged not soberly, but as a transfigured image, and towards a
future which it paints with all the bright colours of desire. Between
the two it sees the sober, everyday working life of bourgeois society
and for this it feels only hatred and abhorrence. In the bourgeois it
sees embodied everything that is shameful and petty. It roams the
world at will, praises all ages and all lands ; but for the conditions of
the present day it has neither understanding nor respect.
The great creative minds whom we honour above all others as
Classics, understood the profound significance of the bourgeois
order. The romanticists lack this insight. They are too small to sing
the song of bourgeois society. They deride the citizen, despise
'shopkeepers' ethics', laugh at the law. They are extraordinarily
quick to see all the faults of everyday life and as quick to trace them
back to defects in social institutions. No romantic has perceived the
grandeur of capitalist society. Compare the results achieved by
these 'shopkeepers' ethics' with the achievements of Christianity!
Christianity has acquiesced in slavery and polygamy, has practically
canonized war, has, in the name of the Lord, burnt heretics and
devastated countries. The much abused 'shopkeepers' have abolished
slavery and sendom, made woman the companion of man with
equal rights, proclaimed equality before the law and the freedom of
thought and opinion, declared war on war, abolished torture, and
mitigated the cruelty of punishment. What cultural force can boast
440

A C H I EVE M E NT S O F C A P I T A L I S M

of similar achievements? Bourgeois civilization has created and
spread a well-being, compared with which all the court life of the
past seems meagre. Before the War, even the less favoured classes of
the urban population could not only clothe and nourish themselves
respectably but could enjoy genuine art and undertake journeys
into distant lands. The romantics, however, saw only those who were
not so well-off; the reason for their comparative poverty being that
bourgeois civilization had not yet created sufficient wealth to make
everybody comfortable. The same romantics had no eyes for those
who were already comfortably circumstanced. 1 What they saw was
always only invariably the dirt and the misery capitalist civiliza­
tion had inherited from the past, not the values which it had already
achieved.

ECON O M I C D E M O C RACY

The slogan 'economic democracy'

NE of the more important arguments in favour ofSocialism is that
Ocontained in the slogan' self-government in industry'. As in the

political sphere the King's absolutism was broken by the peoples'
right to share decisions and later by its sole right to decide, so the
absolutism of owners of the means of production and of entrepreneurs
is to be abolished by consumers and workers. Democracy is incom­
plete as long as everyone is obliged to submit to the dictatorship of
the owners. The worst part of Capitalism is by no means inequality
of income; more unbearable still is the power which it gives the
capitalists over their fellow citizens. As long as this state of affairs
continues there can be no personal freedom. The People must take
the administration of economic matters into is own hands, just as it
has taken over the government of the state. 1
There is a double error in this argument. It misconceives on the
one hand, the nature and function of political democracy, and on the
other, the nature of the social order based on private ownership in
the means of production.
We have already shown that the essence of democracy is to be
found neither in the electoral system, nor in the discussions and
resolutions of national councils, nor in any sort of committee
appointed by these councils. These are merely the technical tools of
political democracy. Its real function is to make peace. Democratic
institutions make the will of the people effective in political matters,

1 'The central wrong of the Capitalist system is neither the poverty of the poor nor
the riches of the rich: it is the power which the mere ownership of the instruments of
production gives to a relatively small section of the community over the actions of their
fellow-citizens and over the mental and physical environment of successive generations.
Under such a system personal freedom becomes, for large masses of the people, little
better than a mockery. . . . What the Socialist aims at is the substitution, for this
Dictatorship of the Capitalist, of government of the people by the people and for the
people, in all the industries and services by which the people live'. (Sidney and Beatrice
Webb, A Constitution for the Socialist Comomnwealth of Great Britain, London 1 920,

THE SLOGAN 'ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY'

by ensuring that its rulers and administrators are elected by the
people's votes. Thus are eliminated those dangers to peaceful social
development which might result from any clash between the will of
the rulers and public opinion. Civil war is averted through the
operation of institutions which facilitate a peaceful change of the
government. In the economic order based on private ownership in
the means of production no special institutions, such as political
democracy has created for itself, are needed to achieve corresponding
success. Free competition does all that is needed. All production
must bend to the consumers' will. From the moment it fails to
conform to the consumers' demands it becomes unprofitable. Thus
free competition compels the obedience of the producer to the
consumer's will and also, in case of need, the transfer of the means of
production from the hands of those unwilling or unable to achieve
what the consumer demands into the hands of those better able to
direct production. The lord of production is the consumer. From
this point of view the capitalist society is a democracy in which every
penny represents a ballot paper. It is a democracy with an imperative
and immediately revocable mandate to its deputies. 1
It is a consumers' democracy. By themselves the producers, as
such, are quite unable to order the direction of production. This is as
true of the entrepreneur as of the worker; both must bow ultimately
to the consumers' wishes. And it could not well be otherwise. People
produce, not for the sake of production, but for the goods that may
be consumed. As producer in an economy based on the division of
labour, a man is merely the agent of the community and as such has
to obey. Only as ·a consumer can he command.
The entrepreneur is thus no more than an overseer of production.
He of course exercises power over the worker. But he cannot exercise
it arbitrarily. He must use it in accordance with the requirements of
that productive activity which corresponds to the consumers'
wishes. To the individual wage-earner whose outlook is enclosed by
the narrow horizon of daily work, the entrepreneur's decisions may

seem arbitrary and capricious. Seen from too close up the shape of
things lose their true significance. If the entrepreneur's disposal of
production injures the worker's momentary interest, it is sure to seem
to him unfounded and arbitrary. He will not realize that the entre­
preneur works under the rule of a strict law. True, the entrepreneur
is free to give full rein to his whims, to dismiss workers off hand, to
cling stubbornly to antiquated processes, deliberately to choose
unsuitable methods of production and to allow himself to be guided
by motives which conflict with the demands of consumers. But when
and in so far as he does this he must pay for it, and if he does not

means of controlling his behaviour are unnecessary.

Special

The market

controls him more strictly and exactingly than could any government
or other organ of society. 1
Every attempt to replace this rule of the consumers by a rule of
producers is absurd. It would run contrary to the very nature of the
productive process. We have already treated an example of this in
greater detail - the example most important for modern conditions
- the example of the syndicalist economy. What is true of it, is true
of any producers' policy. All economy must be a consumers' economy.
The absurdity of these endeavours to institute 'economic democracy'
by the creation of syndicalist institutions becomes apparent if w e
imagine these institutions transferred t o the political field. For
example, would it be democracy ifjudges had to decide what laws
should be in force and how they should be administered? Or if
soldiers had to decide at whose disposal they would place their arms
and how to use them? No, judges and soldiers have to conform to law
if the state is not to become an arbitrary despotism. The catchword
'industrial self-government' is the most blatant of all misconceptions
of the nature of democracy.
In the socialist community, too, it is not the workers in separate
branches of production who decide what is to be done in their own
particular economic territory, but the supreme authority of society.
If this were not so, we should have not Socialism but Syndicalism,
and between these two there is no possible compromise.
1 People overlook this entirely when, like the Webbs (A Constitl4tionfor the Socialist
Commonweolth of Great Britain, p. xii) they say that the workers have to obey the
orders 'of irresponsible masters intent on their own pleasure or their own gain'.

§2
The consumer as the deciding factor in production
People sometimes maintain that in guarding their own interests,
entrepreneurs force production in a direction opposed to the interests
of consumers. The entrepreneurs have no scruples about 'creating
or intensifying the public's need for things which provide for merely
sensual gratification but inflict harm on health or spiritual welfare'.
For instance the fight against alcoholism, the dread menace to
national health and welfare, is said to be made more difficult because
of the opposition 'of the vested interests of alcohol capitalism to all
attempts to combat it' . The habit of smoking would not be 'so
widespread and so greatly on the increase among the young if
economic interests played no role in promoting it'. 'Luxury articles,
baubles and tinsel of an kinds, trashy and obscene publications' are
to-day 'forced upon the public because the producers profit by them
or hope to do so'. 1 It is common knowledge that the large-scale
arming of the Powers and therefore, indirectly, war itself are ascribed
to the machinations of 'armament-capital' .
Entrepreneurs and capitalists in search of investments turn
towards those branches of production from which they hope to
obtain the greatest profit. They try to fathom the future wants of
consumers so as to gain a general survey of demand. As Capitalism is
constantly creating new wealth for all and extending the satisfaction
of wants, consumers are frequently in the position of being able to
satisfy wants which formerly remained unsatisfied. Thus it becomes a
special task of the capitalist entrepreneur to find out what formerly
unsatisfied wants can now be provided for. This is what people have
in mind when they say that Capitalism creates wants in order to
satisfy them.
The nature of the things demanded by the consumer does not
concern the entrepreneur and the capitalist. They are merely the
obedient servants of the consumer and it is not their business to
prescribe what the consumer shall enjoy. They give him poison and
murderous weapons if he wants them. But nothing could be more
erroneous than to suppose that products which serve a bad or harmful

ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY
purpose bring in more than those which serve a good one. The
highest profit is obtained from articles for which there is the most
urgent demand. The profit-seeker therefore sets about producing
those commodities in which there is the greatest disproportion
between supply and demand. Of course, once he has invested his
capital, it is to his interest to see that the demand for his product
increases. He tries to expand sales. But in the long run he cannot
prevail against a change of demand. Neither can he obtain much
advantage from growth in the demand for his products, for new
enterprises turn their attention to his branch of industry and thereby
tend to reduce his profits to the average.
Mankind does not drink alcohol because there are breweries ,
distilleries, and vineyards; men brew beer, distil spirits, and grow
grapes because of the demand for alcoholic drinks. 'Alcohol-capital'
has not created drinking habits any more than it has created drinking
songs. The capitalists who own shares in breweries and distilleries
would have preferred shares in publishing firms for devotional books,
had the demand been for spiritual and not spirituous sustenance.
'Armament capital' did not create wars ; wars created 'armament
capital'. It was not Krupp and Schneider who incited the nations to
war, but imperialist writers and politicians.
If a man thinks alcohol and nicotine harmful, let him abstain
from them. Let him try, if he will, to convert his fellows to his own
views on abstinence. What is certain is that he cannot, in a capitali�t
sodety, whose basic prindple is the self-determination and self­
responsibility of each individual, force them against their will to
renounce alcohol and nicotine. If this inability to impose his will on
others causes him regret, then at least he can console himselfwith the
thought that neither is he at the mercy of the commands of others.
Some socialists reproach the capitalist social order primarily for
the rich variety of its goods. Instead of producing uniform products,
which could be brought out on the largest scale, people manufacture
hundreds and thousands of types of each commodity, and pro­
duction is made much more expensive thereby. Socialism would put
at the comrades' disposal only uniform goods ; it would unify pro­
duction and thereby raise nationai productivity. Simuitaneousiy
Socialism would dissolve separate family households, and in their
place provide communal kitchens and hotel-like dwellings; this, too,
would increase social wealth by eliminating the waste of labour

C O N S U M E R A S D E C I D I N G FA C T O R

power in tiny kitchens which serve only a few consumers. Many
socialist writings, above all those of Waiter Rathenau have dealt
with these ideas in great detai1. 1
Under Capitalism each buyer has to decide whether he prefers
the cheaper uniformity of mass production or the greater expense of
articles specially manufactured to suit the taste of the individual or
the small group. There is unmistakably a tendency towards pro­
gressive uniformity of production and consumption through
standardization. Commodities used in the productive process itself
are daily becoming more standardized. The shrewd entrepreneur
soon discovers the advantage of using the standard type - with its
lower purchasing cost, its replaceability and adaptability to other
productive processes rather than articles produced by a special
process. The movement to standardize the implements of production
is impeded to-day by the fact that numerous enterprises are indirectly
or directly socialized. As they are not rationally controlled, no
stress is laid on the advantage of using standard types. Army
administrations, municipal building departments, State railways,
and .similar authorities resist, with bureaucratic obstinacy, the
adoption of types in universal use. The unification of the production
of machines, factory equipment, and semi-finished products does not
require a change to Socialism. On the contrary, Capitalism does this
more quickly of its own accord.
It is otherwise with goods for use and consumption. If a man
satifies his special, personal taste in preference to using the uniform
products of mass production and believes that his satisfaction
balances the extra cost, then one cannot objectively prove him
wrong. If my friend prefers to dress, be housed, and eat as it pleases
him and not to do as everyone else does, who can blame him? For
his happiness lies in the satisfaction of his wishes; he wants to live as
he pleases and not as I or others would live were we in his place.
It is his valuation that counts, not mine or other people'S. I may be
able to prove to him that the judgments on which he bases his values
are false. For example I may demonstrate that the foods he con­
sumes have a smaller nutritional value than he assumed. But if his
vaiues have been built, not on untenable views about the relation of
cause and effect, but on subjective sentiments and feelings, my
1 Rathenau, Die neue Wirtschaft, Berlin 1918, p. 41 et seq.; also the critique of Wiese,
Freie Wirtschaft, Leipzig 1918.
447

ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY
arguments cannot change his mind. If, notwithstanding the
advantages claimed for hotel life and communal kitchens, he still
prefers a separate household because such sentiments as 'own home'
and 'own hearth' weigh with him more than arguments in favour of
unitary organization, then nothing further remains to be said. If he
wishes to furnish his dwelling according to his personal taste and not
according to the public taste which guides the furniture manu­
facturer, there are no arguments with which to refute him. If,
knowing the effects of alcohol, he still drinks it, because he is pre­
pared to pay even dearly for the pleasure it gives him, I may
certainly, from the standpoint of my values, call him unwise, but it is
his will, his valuation that will decide. If I, as a dictator, or as a
member of a despotically ruling majority, prohibit the drinking of
alcohol, I do not thus raise the productivity of social production.
Those who condemn alcohol would have avoided it without pro­
hibition. For all others, the prohibition of an enjoyment which they
value above anything they can obtain by renouncing it means. a
falling-off in satisfaction.
The contrast of productivity and profitableness, which, as we
see from arguments explained in a previous chapter, is valueless for
the understanding of the working of production directed to given
ends, must lead definitely to false conclusions if applied to the ends of
economic action. 1 In dealing with means to a given end, one may
call this process or that the more practical, that is, capable of a
higher yield. But when we ask whether this or that means gives a
greater direct increase of welfare to the individual, we have no
objective standards that will serve. Here the subjective will of man
is the deciding factor. A man's preference for water, milk, or wine
does not depend on the physiological effects of these drinks, but on
his valuation of the effects. If a man drinks wine and not water I
cannot say he is acting irrationally. At most I can say that in his
place I would not do so. But his pursuit of happiness is his own
business, not mine.
If the socialist community does not supply the comrades with the
goods which they themselves want to enjoy, but with those which
the rulers think they ought to enjoy, the sum of satisfactions is not
increased, but diminished. One certainly could not call this violation
of the individual will 'economic democracy' .

For it is an essential difference between capitalist and socialist
production that in the first men provide for themselves, while in the
second they are provided for. The socialist wants to feed and house
humanity and cover its nakedness. But men prefer to eat, dwell,
dress and generally to seek happiness after their own fashion.

§3
Socialism

as

expression of the will of the majoriry

The number of our contemporaries who decide in favour of
Socialism because the majority has already so decided is by no means
negligible. 'Most people want Socialism; the masses no longer
support the capitalist social order, therefore we must socialize.' One
hears this constantly. But it is not a convincing argument in the eyes
of those who reject Socialism. Certainly if the majority want
Socialism, Socialism we shall have. Nobody has shown more clearly
than the liberal philosophers that there is no resisting public
opinion, and that the majority decides, even when it is in error. If
the majority makes a mistake, the minority must also suffer the
consequences and cannot complain. Has it not been party to the
error in having failed to enlighten the majority?
But in discussing what is to be, the argument that the great mass
of people violently demand Socialism would be valid only if Socialism
were desired as an ultimate end for its own sake. But this is by no
means so. Like all other forms of social organization Socialism is
only a means, not an end in itself. Those who want Socialism, like
those who reject it, want well-being and happiness, and they are
socialists only because they believe that Socialism is the best way to
achieve this. If they were convinced that the liberal order of society
was better able to fulfil their wishes they would become liberals.
Therefore, the argument that one must be socialist because the
masses demand Socialism is the worst possible argument against an
enemy of Socialism. The will of the people is the highest law for the
representatives of the people who have to execute its commands.
But those who seek to direct thought must not bend to this will.
Only he is a pioneer who speaks out and attempts to bring his fellow
citizens to his ways of thinking, even when they differ from those
generally held. This argument that one should defer to the masses is
449

ET H I C A L

S O C I A L I S M

nothing else than a demand that those who still oppose Socialism by
reasonable criticism should abdicate reason itself. That such an
argument can be put forward only shows how far the socialization of
intellectual life has already gone. In the very darkest epochs of early
history, such arguments have not been used. Those who opposed the
prejudices of the greatest number were never told that their opinions
were false simply because the majority thought otherwise.
If Socialism is inherently impracticable the fact that everyone
desires it will not enable us to accomplish it.

§I
Capitalist ethics and the impracticabiliry of Socialism

N the expositions of Ethical Socialism one constantly finds the
I assertion that it presupposes the moral purification of men. As

long as we do not succeed in elevating the masses morally we shall
be unable to transfer the socialist order of society from the sphere of
ideas to that of reality. The difficulties in the way of Socialism lie
exclusively, or predominantly, in men's moral shortcomings. Some
writers doubt whether this obstacle will ever be overcom� ; others
are content to say that the world will not be able to achieve Socialism
for the present or in the immediate future.
We have been able to show why the socialist economy is im­
practicable: not because men are morally too base, but because the
problems that a socialist order would have to solve present insuper­
able intellectual difficulties. The impracticability of Socialism is the
result of intellectual, not moral, incapacity. Socialism could not
achieve its end, because a socialist economy could not calculate value.
Even angels, if they were endowed only with human reason, could
not form a socialistic community.
If a socialist community were capable of economic calculation, it
could be set up without any change in men's moral character. In a
socialist society different ethical standards would prevail from those
of a society based on private ownership in the means of production.
The temporary sacrifices demanded of the individual by society
would be different. Yet it would be no more difficult to enforce the
code of socialist morals than it is to enforce the code of capitalist
n;torals,. if .there we�e .any p.ossibility of ��king ?bjective comput�­
tlons ,\vlthln the socIalIst SOCIety. If a socIalIst SOCIety could ascertain
separately the product of the labour of each single member of the
society, his share in the social product could be calculated and his
reward fixed proportionately to his productive contribution. Under
such circumstances the socialist order would have no cause to fear
45 1

CAPITALI ST ETH I C S
that a comrade would fail to work with the maximum of energy for
lack of any incentive to sweeten the toil oflabour. Only because this
condition is lacking, Socialism will have to construct for its Utopia a
type of human being totally different from the race which now walks
the earth, one to whom labour is not toil and pain, but joy and
pleasure. Because such a calculus is out ofthe question, the Utopian
socialist is obliged to make demands on men which are diametrically
opposed to nature. This inadequacy of the human type which would
cause the breakdown of Socialism, may appear to be of a moral
order; on closer examination it turns out to be a question of intellect.

§2
The alleged defects of capitalist ethics
To act reasonably means to sacrifice the less important to the
more important. We make temporary sacrifices when we give up
small things to obtain bigger things, as when we cease to indulge in
alcohol to avoid its physiological after-effects. Men submit to the
effort of labour in order that they may not starve.
Moral behaviour is the name we give to the temporary sacrifices
made in the interests of social co-operation, which is the chief means
by which human wants and human life generally may be supplied.
All ethics are social ethics. (Ifit be claimed that rational behaviour,
directed solely towards one's own good, should be called ethical too,
and that we had to deal with individual ethics and with duties to
oneself, we could not dispute it; indeed this mode of expression
emphasizes perhaps better than ours, that in the last analysis the
hygiene of the individual and social ethics are based on the same
reasoning.) To behave morally, means to sacrifice the less important
to the more important by making social co-operation possible.
The fundamental defect of most of the anti-utilitarian systems of
ethics lies in the misconstruction of the meaning of the temporary
sacrifices which duty demands. They do not see the purpose of
sacrifice and foregoing of pleasure, and they construct the absurd
hypothesis that sacrifice and renunciation are morally valuable in
themselves. They elevate unselfishness and self-sacrifice and the
love of compassion, which lead to them, to absolute moral values.
The pain that at first accompanies the sacrifice is defined as moral

452

ALLEGED DEFECTS

because it is painful - which is very near asserting that all action
painful to the performer is moral.
From the discovery of this confusion we can see why various
sentiments and actions which are socially neutral or even harmful
come to be called moral. Of course, even reasoning of this sort
cannot avoid returning furtively to utilitarian ideas. If we are
unwilling to praise the compassion of a doctor who hesitates to
undertake a life-saving operation on the ground that he thereby
saves the patient pain, and distinguish, therefore, between true and
false compassion, we re-introduce the teleological consideration of
purpose which we tried to avoid. If we praise unselfish action, then
human welfare, as a purpose, cannot be excluded. There thus arises
a negative utilitarianism: we are to regard as moral that which
benefits, not the person acting, but others. An ethical ideal has been
set up which cannot be fitted into the world we live in. Therefore,
having condemned the society built up on 'self-interest' the moralist
proceeds to construct a society in which human beings are to be
what his ideal requires. He begins by misunderstanding the world
and its laws; he then wishes to construct a world corresponding to
his false theories, and he calls this the setting up of a moral ideal.
Man is not evil merely because he wants to enjoy pleasure and
avoid pain - in other words, to live. Renunciation, abnegation, and
self-sacrifice are not good in themselves. To condemn the ethics
demanded by social life under Capitalism and to set up in their place
standards for moral behaviour which - it is thought - might be
adopted under Socialism is a purely arbitrary procedure.

The nature of destructionism

Under Socialism, planned
1llanagement of economic life takes the place of anarchy of
production; society, which is conceived as the incarnation of reason,
takes the place of the conflicting aims of unreasonable and self­
interested individuals. A just distribution replaces an unjust distri­
bution of goods. Want and misery vanish and there is wealth for all.
A picture of paradise is unfolded before us, a paradise which - so the
laws of historical evolution tell us - we, or at least our heirs, must at
length inherit. For all history leads to that promised land, and all
that has happened in the past has only prepared the way for our
salvation.
This is how our contemporaries see Socialism, and they believe
in its excellence. It is false to imagine that the socialist ideology
dominates only those parties which call themselves socialist or ­
what is generally intended to mean the same thing - 'social'. All
present-day political parties are saturated with the leading socialistic
ideas. Even the stoutest opponents of Socialism fall within its shadow.
They, too, are convinced that the socialist economy is more rational
than the capitalist, that it guarantees a juster distribution of income,
that historical evolution is driving man inexorably in that direction.
When they oppose Socialism they do so with the sense that they are
defending selfish private interests and that they are combating a
development which from the standpoint of public welfare is desirable
and is based upon the only ethically acceptable principle. And in
their hearts they are convinced that their resistance is hopeless.

future social order proves to be inwardly contradictory, and therefore
impracticable. Not only would Socialism fail to make economic life
more rational, it would abolish social co-operation outright. That it
would bring justice is merely an arbitrary assertion, arising, as we
can show, from resentment and the false interpretation of what takes
place under Capitalism. And that historical evolution leaves us no
alternative but Socialism turns out to be a prophecy which differs
from the chiliastic dreams of primitive Christian sectarians only in
its claim to the title 'science'.
In fact Socialism is not in the least what it pretends to be. It is
not the pioneer of a better and finer world, but the spoiler of what
thousands of years of civilization have created. It does not build; it
destroys. For destruction is the essence of it. It produces nothing, it
only consumes what the social order based on private ownership in
the means of production has created. Since a socialist order of
society cannot exist, unless it be as a fragment of Socialism within an
economic order resting otherwise on private property, each step

leading towards Socialism must exhaust itself in the destruction of
what already exists.
Such a policy of destructionism means the consumption of capital.
There are few who recognize this fact. Capital consumption can be
detected statistically and can be conceived intellectually, but it is
not obvious to everyone. To see the weakness of a policy which
raises the consumption of the masses at the cost of existing capital
wealth, and thus sacrifices the future to the present, and to recognize
the nature of this policy, requires deeper insight than that vouchsafed
to statesmen and politicians or to the masses who have put them into
power. As long as the walls of the factory buildings stand, and the
trains continue to run, it is supposed that all is well with the world.
The increasing difficulties of maintaining the higher standard of
living are ascribed to various causes, but never to the fact that a
policy of capital consumption is being followed.
In the problem of the capital consumption of a destructionist
society we find one of the key problems of the socialist economic
policy. The danger of capital consumption would be particularly
great in the socialist community; the demagogue would achieve
success most easily by increasing consumption per head at the cost of
the formation of additional capital and to the detriment of existing

capital.

DEMAGOGY

It is in the nature of capitalist society that new capital is con­
tinually being formed. The greater the capital fund becomes, the
higher does the marginal productivity of labour rise and the higher,
therefore, are wages, absolute and relative. The progressive forma­
tion of capital is the only way to increase the quantity of goods which
society can consume annually without diminishing production in the
future - the only way to increase the workers' consumption without
harm to future generations of workers. Therefore, it has been laid
down by Liberalism that progressive capital formation is the only
means by which the position of the great masses can be permanently
improved. Socialism and destructionism seek to attain this end in a
different way. They propose to use up capital so as to achieve present
wealth at the expense of the future. The policy of Liberalism is the
procedure of the prudent father who saves and builds for himself and
his successors. The policy of destructionism is the policy of the
spendthrift who dissipates his inheritance regardless of the future.

§2
Demagogy
To Marxians, Karl Marx's supreme achievement lay in the fact
that he roused the proletariat to class-consciousness. Before he
wrote, socialist ideas had led an academic existence in the writings of
the U topians and in the narrow circles of their disciples. By con­
necting these ideas with a revolutionary workers' movement which
till then had only a petty bourgeois aim, Marx created, say the
Marxians, the foundations of the proletarian movement. This
movement, they believe, will live until it has accomplished its
historical mission, the setting up of the socialist order of society.
Marx is supposed to have discovered the dynamic laws of
capitalist society and, with the aid of the theory of historical evolu­
tion, to have defined the aims of the modem social movement as
inevitable consequences of that evolution. He is said to have shown
that the proletariat could free itself as a class only by itself abolishing
the class conflict, and so making possible a society in which 'the free
development of each individuaf is the condition for the free develop­
ment of all'.
Ecstatic enthusiasts see in Marx one of the heroic figures of world
history, and class him among the great economists and sociologists,
459

MOTIVE POWERS OF DESTRUCTIONISM
even among the most eminent philosophers. The unbiased observer
looks on Karl Marx's work with different eyes. As an economist Marx
entirely lacked originality. He was a follower of the Classical political
economists, but he lacked the ability to approach essentially economic
problems without a political bias. He saw everything through the
spectacles of the agitator, who considers first and foremost the effect
made on the popular mind. Even here he was not really original, for
the English socialist defenders of the Right to the Full Produce of
Labour, who with their pamphlets in the third and fourth decades of
the nineteenth century prepared the way for Chartism, had already
anticipated him in all essentials. Moreover, he had the misfortune to
be entirely ignorant of the revolution in theoretical economics which
was proceeding during the years when he worked out his system, a
transformation which made itself known soon after the issue of the
first volume of Das Kapital. A&5 a result, the later volumes of Das
Kapital, from the day they were published, were quite out of touch
with modern science. This was a piece of bad luck which hit his
infatuated followers particularly hard. From the beginning, they
had to be content with barren expositions of the master's writings.
They have timidly avoided any contact with the modern theory of
value. As a sociologist and historical philosopher Marx was never
more than an able agitator writing for the daily needs of his party.
The materialist conception of history is scientifically worthless;
moreover Marx never worked it out exactly but propounded it in
various incompatible forms. His philosophic standpoint was that of
...

the Hegelians. He is one of the many writers ofhis time, now mostly

forgotten, who applied the dialectic method to all fields of science.
Decades had to pass before people had the face to call him a
philosopher and to place him side by side with the great thinkers.
As a scientific writer Marx was dry, pedantic, and heavy. The
gift of expressing himself intelligibly had been denied him. In his
political writings alone does he produce powerful effects, and these
only by means of dazzling antitheses and of phrases which are easy
to remember, sentences which by play of words hide their own
vacuity. In his polemics he does not hesitate to distort what his own
opponent had said. Instead of refuting he tends to abuse. 1 Here, too,

1

See for instance, in Das Kapital the remarks on Bentham: 'the most homely
platitude', 'only copied stupidly', 'trash', 'a genius of bourgeois stupidity' (op. cit.,
Vol. I, p. 573) on Malthus, 'a schoolboyishly superficial and clerically stilted plagiarism'
(Ibid., Vol. I, p. 580).

460

D EMAGO GY
his disciples (his school really exists only in Germany and Eastern
Europe, especially in Russia) have faithfully imitated the master's
example, reviling their opponents but never attempting to refute
them by argument.
Marx's originality and historical significance lie entirely in the
field of political technique. He recognizes the immense social power
that can be achieved by welding out of the great masses of workers,
herded together in workshops, a political factor; and he seeks and
finds the slogans to unite these masses into a coherent movement.
He produces the catchword which leads people otherwise indifferent
to politics to attack private property. He preaches a doctrine of

salvation which rationalizes their resentment and transfigures their
envy and desire for revenge into a mission ordained by world history.
He inspires them with consciousness of their mission by greeting them
as those who carry in themselves the future of the human race. The
rapid expansion of Sociaiism has been compared to that of Christi­
anity. More appropriate, perhaps, would be a comparison with
Islam, which inspired the sons of the desert to lay waste ancient
civilizations, cloaked their destructive fury with an ethical ideology
and stiffened their courage with rigid fatalism. 1
At the core of Marxism is the doctrine of the identity of interests
of all proletarians. As an individual, however, the worker is daily in
sharp competitive conflict with his fellow-workers and with those
who are quite ready to take his job from him; together with his own
comrades in his own trade he competes with workers in other
branches of the trade and with the consumers of the products in the
production of which he collaborates. In the face of all these facts, all
his passions had to be raised to induce him to seek his salvation in
union with other workers. But this was not so very difficult; it always
pays to rouse what is evil in the human heart. Yet Marx has done
more : he has decked out the resentment of the common man with
the nimbus of science, and has thus made it attractive to those who
live on a higher intellectual and ethical plane. Every socialist move­
ment has borrowed in this respect from Marx, adapting the doctrine
slightly for its special needs.
1 Thus Marxism finds it easy to ally with Islamic zealotism. Full of pride the
marxist Otto Bauer cries: ' In Turkestan and Azerbaijan monuments to Marx stand
opposite the mosques, and the Mullah in Persia mingles quotations from Marx with
passages from the Koran when he calls the people to the Holy War against European
Imperialism.' See Otto Bauer, Marx als Mahllung (Der Kampi, XVI, 1 923, p. 83).
46 1

MOTIVE POWERS OF DESTRUCTIONISM
As a master of demagogic technique Marx was a genius; this can­
not be sufficiently emphasized. He found the propitious historical
moment for uniting the masses into a single political movement, and
was himself on the spot to lead this movement. For him all politics
was only the continuation of war by other means; his political art
was always political tactics. The socialist parties which trace their
origin back to Marx have kept this up, as have those who have taken
the marxist parties for their model. They have elaborated the tech­
nique of agitation, the cadging for votes and for souls, the stirring
up of electoral excitement, the street demonstrations, and the terror­
ism. To learn the technique of these things requires years of hard
study. At their party conferences and in their party literature, the
marxians give more attention to questions of organization and of
tactics than to th e most important basic problems of politics. In
fact, if one wished to be more precise one would have to admit that
nothing interests them at all except from the point of view of party
tactics and that they have no interest to spare for anything else.
This militarist attitude to politics, which reveals the inner
affinity of Marxism with Prussian and Russian etatism has quickly
found adherents. The modern parties of the continent of Europe
have completely accepted the Marxian ideology. Especially the
parties which aim to promote particular interests, and which gather
together the peasant class, the industrial middle class and the class
of employees, make use of the Marxist doctrine of class-war for their
own purposes. They have learnt all they know from Marxism.
The defeat of the liberal ideology could not long be postponed.
Liberalism has anxiously avoided all political artifice. It has relied
entirely upon the inner vitality of its ideas and their power to con­
vince, and has disdained all other means of political conflict. It has
never pursued political tactics, never stooped to demagogy. The old
Liberalism was honest through and through and faithful to its
principles. Its opponents called this being 'doctrinaire' .
To-day the old liberal principles have to be submitted to a
thorough re-examination. Science has been completely transformed
in the last hundred years, and to-day the general sociological and
economic foundations of the liberal doctrine have to be relaid. On
many questions Liberalism did not think logically to the conclusion.
There are loose threads to be gathered Up. l But the mode of

political activity of Liberalism cannot alter. It regards all social
co-operation as an emanation of rationally recognized utility, in
which all power is based on public opinion, and can undertake no
course of action that would hinder the free decision of thinking men.
Liberalism knows that society can advance to a higher stage only by
men recognizing the usefulness of social co-operation; that neither
God nor veiled destiny determines the future of the human race, but
only man himself. When nations rush blindly towards destruction,
Liberalism must try to enlighten them. But even if they do not hear,
whether because they are deaf or because the warning voice is too
feeble, one must not seek to seduce them to the right mode of conduct
by tactical and demagogic artifice. It might be possible to destroy
society by demagogy. But it can never be built up by that means.

§3
The destructionism of the literati
The romantic and the social art of the nineteenth century have
prepared the way for socialist destructionism. Without the help it
got from this direction . Socialism would never have gained its hold
on people's minds.
Romanticism is man's revolt against reason, as well as against
the condition under which nature has compelled him to live. The
romantic is a daydreamer; he easily manages in imagination to dis­
regard the laws of logic and of nature. The thinking and rationally
acting man tries to rid himself of the discomfort of unsatisfied wants
by economic action and work; he produces in order to improve his
position. The romantic is too weak - too neurasthenic - for work;
he imagines the pleasures of success but he does nothing to achieve
them. He does not remove the obstacles; he merely removes them
in imagination. He has a grudge against reality because it is not like
the dream world he has created. He hates work, economy, and
reason.

that portion of these people's lives which seems pleasant to him,
never their lack of the things he obtains in such abundance. His
horsemen gallop over the plains on fiery steeds, his corsairs capture
beautiful women, his knights vanquish their enemies between
episodes of love and song. The perilous nature of their existence, the
compa.rative poverty of their circumstances, their miseries and their
toils - these things his imagination tactfully overlooks: all is trans­
figured by a rosy gleam. Compared with this dream ideal, reality
appears arid and shallow. There are obstacles to overcome which
do not exist in the dream. There are very different tasks to be under­
taken. Here are no beautiful women to be rescued from the hands
of robbers, no lost treasures to be found, no dragons to kill. Here
there is work to do, ceaselessly, assiduously, day after day, year after
year. Here one must plough and sow if one wishes to reap. The

refuses to recognize it. He mocks and jeers ; he despises and loathes
the bourgeois.
The spread of capitalist thought produced an attitude of mind
unfriendly to Romanticism. The poetic figures of knights and
pirates become objects of mirth. Now that the lives of bedouins,
maharajahs, pirates, and other romantic heroes had been observed
at close quarters, any desire to emulate them vanished. The achieve­
ments of the capitalist social order made it good to be alive and there
was a growing feeling that security of life and liberty, peaceful
welfare, and richer satisfaction of wants could be expected only from
Capitalism. The romantic contempt for what is bourgeois fell into
disrepute.
But the mental attitude from which Romanticism sprang was not
so easy to eradicate. The neurasthenic protest against life sought
other forms of expression. It found it in the 'social' art of the nine­
teenth century.
The really great poets and novelists of the period were not
social-political propagandist writers. Flaubert, Maupassant, Jacob­
sen, Strindberg, Konrad Ferdinand Meyer, to name only a few, were
far from being followers of the fashionable literature. We do not owe
the statement of these social and political problems to the writers
whose works have given the nineteenth century its lasting place in
the history of literature. This was the task assumed by second- or
third-rate writers. It was writers of this class who introduced as

464

literary figures the blood sucking capitalist entrepreneur and the
noble proletarian. To them the rich man is in the wrong because he
is rich, and the poor in the right because he is poor. 1 'But this is just
as if wealth were a crime', Gerhart Hauptmann makes Frau Dreis­
siger exclaim in Die Weber. The literature of this period is full of the
condemnation of property.
This is not the place for an aesthetic analysis of these works; our
task is to examine their political effects. They have brought victory
to Socialism by enlisting the allegiance of the educated classes. By
means of such books Socialism has been carried into the houses of
the wealthy, captivating the wives and daughters and causing the
sons to turn away from the family business until at last the capitalist
entrepreneur himself has begun to believe in the baseness of his
activities. Bankers, captains of industry, and merchants have filled
the boxes of theatres in which plays of a socialist tendency were given
before enthusiastic audiences.
Social art is tendentious art: all social literature has a thesis to
demonstrate.I It is ever the same thesis: Capitalism is an evil,
Socialism is salvation. That such eternal repetition has not led to
boredom sooner must be attributed solely to the fact that the various
writers have had different forms of Socialism in mind. But they
all follow Marx's example in avoiding detailed exposition of the
socialist social order they praise; most of them merely indicate by
allusion, though clearly enough, that they desire a socialist
order. That the logic of their argument is inadequate and that the
conclusions are driven home by an appeal to the emotions rather
than to reason is hardly surprising, seeing that the same method is
followed by soi-disant scientific authorities on Socialism. Fiction is a
favoured vehicle for this kind of procedure, as there is little fear that
anyone will try to refute its assertions in detail by logical criticism.
It is not the custom to inquire into the accuracy of particular remarks
in novels and plays. Even if it were, the author could still find a way
out by denying responsibility for the particular words put into the
mouth of a hero. The conclusions forced home by character-drawing
cannot be invalidated by logic. Even if the 'man of property' is
always depicted as bad through and through, one cannot reproach

the author on account of a simple example. For the total effect of
the literature of his time no single writer is responsible.
In Hard Times Dickens puts into the mouth of Sissy jupe, the
deserted little daughter of a circus clown and dancer, remarks
designed to shatter Utilitarianism and Liberalism. He makes Mr.
M'Choackumchild, teacher in the model school of the Benthamite
capitalist Gradgrind, ask how great is the percentage of victims
when, out of 1 00,000 sea travellers, 500 are drowned. The good child
answers, that for the relatives and friends of the victims there is no
percentage - and so condemns with quiet simplicity the self-com­
placency of Manchesterism. Leaving aside the far-fetched improba­
bility of the scene, this is of course all very fine and touching. But it
does not diminish the satisfaction which members of a capitalist
community may feel when they contemplate the great reduction of
the dangers of navigation under Capitalism. And if Capitalism has
so contrived that out of 1 ,000,000 people only twenty-five starve each
year, while under more ancient economic systems a much greater
proportion starved, then our estimation of this achievement is not
impaired by Sissy's platitude, that for those who starve the ordeal is
just as bitter whether a million or a million million others are starving
at the same time or not. Moreover, we are offered no proof that in a
socialist society fewer people would starve. The third observation
which Dickens puts into Sissy's mouth is intended to show that one
cannot judge the economic prosperity of a nation by the amount of
its wealth, but one must consider also the distribution of that wealth.
Dickens was too ignorant of the writings of the utilitarians to know
that these views did not contradict the older utilitarianism. Bentham,
particularly, maintained with special emphasis that a sum of wealth
brings more happiness when it is evenly distributed than when it is
so distributed as to endow some richly while others have little. 1
Sissy's counterpart is the model boy, Bitzer. He gets his mother
into the workhouse and then contents himself with giving her half a
pound of tea once a year. Even this, says Dickens, is a weakness in
the otherwise admirable youth, whom he calls an excellent young
economist. For one thing, all almsgiving inevitably tends to pauperize
the recipient. Further, Bitzer's only rational action with regard to
tea would have been to buy as cheaply, and sell it as dearly as
possible. Have not philosophers demonstrated that in this consists
1 Bentham, Principles of the Ci'IJil Code, p. 304 et seq.

466

D E STRU C T I O N I S M O F THE

L I B ERAT I

the whole duty of man (the whole, not a part of his duty) ? Millions
who have read these observations have felt the indignation for the
baseness of utilitarian thought which the author meant them to feel.
Nevertheless, they are quite unjust. It is true that liberal politicians
have striven against the encouragement of beggars by means of
indiscriminate almsgiving and have shown the futility of any
attempt at bettering the situation of the poor which does not pro­
ceed by increasing the productivity oflabour. They have exposed the
danger to the proletarians themselves of proposals for increasing the
birth rate by premature marriages between persons not in a position
to take care of their children. But they have never protested against
support through the Poor Law of people unable to work. Neither
have they contested the moral duty of children to support their
parents in old age. The liberal social philosophy has never said that
it was a 'duty', let alone the beginning and end of morality, to buy
as cheaply as possible and sell as dearly as possible. It has shown
that this is the rational behaviour for the individual seeking (by
buying and selling) the means for the indirect satisfaction of his
wants. But Liberalism has no more called it irrational to give tea
to one's aged mother than it has called tea drinking in itseifirrational.
One glance into the works of the utilitarians is enough to unmask
these sophisitical distortions. But there is hardly one in every hun­
dred thousand readers of Dickens who has ever read a line of a
utilitarian writer. Dickens, with other romantics less gifted as story­
tellers but following the same tendencies, has taught millions to hate
Liberalism and Capitalism. And yet Dickens was not an open and
direct champion of destructionism, any more than were William
Morris, Shaw, Wells, Zola, Anatole France, Gerhart Hauptmann,
Edmondo de Amicis, and many others. They all reject the capitalist
social order and combat private ownership in the means of produc­
tion, without perhaps always being conscious of it. Between the
lines they suggest an inspiring picture of a better state of affairs
economically and socially. They are recruiting agents for Socialism
and, since Socialism must destroy society, are at the same time
paving the way for destructionism. But just as political Socialism
became finally, in Bolshevism, an open avowal of destructionism, so
too did literary Socialism. Tolstoi is the great prophet of a destruc­
tionism that goes back to the words of the Gospels. He makes the
teachings of Christ, which rested on a belief that the Kingdom of

46 7

MOTIVE POWERS OF DESTRUCTIONISM
God was imminent; a gospel for all times and all men. Like the
communist sects of the Middle Ages and the Reformation he tries to
build society on the commands of the Sermon on the Mount. He
does not of course go so far as to take literally the exhortation to
follow the example of the lilies of the field, which toil not. But in his
ideal of society there is only room for self-sufficing agriculturists who,
with modest means, till a small piece ofland, and he is logical enough
to demand that everything else shall be destroyed.
And now the peoples which have hailed with the greatest en­
thusiasm such writings, which call for the destruction of all cultural
values, are themselves on the verge of a great social catastrophe.

CHAPTER

THE METHODS OF DESTRUCTIONISM

§I
The means of destructionism

OCIALIST policy employs two methods to accomplish its purposes:
S the first aims directly at converting society to Socialism ; the second

aims only indirectly at this conversion by destroying the social order
which is based on private ownership. The parties of social reform
and the evolutionary wings of the socialist parties prefer the first
means; the second is the weapon of revolutionary Socialism, which is
primarily concerned to dear the ground for building up a new
civilization by liquidating the old one. To the first category belong
municipalization and nationalization of enterprises; to the second,
sabotage and revolution.
The importance of this division is lessened materially by the fact
that the effects achieved by both groups do not greatly differ. As
we have shown, even the direct method which aims at the creation
of a new society can only destroy; it cannot create. Thus the be­
ginning and end of the socialist policy, which has dominated the
world for decades, is destruction. In the policy of the communists
the will to destroy is so clear that no one can overlook it. But
although destructionism is more easily recognized in the actions of
the Bolshevists than in other parties, it is essentially just as strong in
all other socialist movements. State interference in economic life,
which calls itself 'economic policy', has done nothing but destroy
economic life. Prohibitions and regulations have by their general
obstructive tendency fostered the growth of the spirit of wastefulness.
Already during the war period this policy had gained so much
ground that practically all economic action of the entrepreneur was
branded as violation of the law. That production is still being carried
on, even semi-rationally, is to be ascribed only to the fact that
destructionist laws and measures have not yet been able to operate
completely and effectively. Were they more effective, hunger and
mass extinction would be the lot of all civilized nations to-day.

469

METHODS OF DESTRUCTIONISM

Our whole life is so given over to destructionism that one can
name hardly a field into which it has not penetrated. 'Social' art
preaches it, schools teach it, the churches disseminate it. In recent
decades the legislation of civilized states has created hardly one
important law in which at least a few concessions have not been
made to destructionism; some laws it completely dominates. To
give a comprehensive account of destructionism one would have to
write the history of the years in which the catastrophic World War
and the Bolshevist Revolution were prepared and consummated.
This cannot be undertaken here. We must content ourselves with
a few remarks which may contribute to an understanding of
destructionist development.

§2
Labour legislation
Amongst the means destructionist policy has employed, the legal
protection of labour is, in its direct effects, the most harmless. Yet
this aspect of social policy is specially important as an outcome of
destructionist thought.
The advocates of the protection of labour like to consider the
problem as analogous to the situation which led to the measures
taken in the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century
to protect tied labourers under the manorial system. Just as at that
time the peasant's labour obligations were continually reduced by
State intervention in an attempt to free the serf step by step, so
labour legislation at the present day is supposed to be no more than
the attempt to raise the modern proletarian from wage slavery to an
existence worthy of a human being. But this comparison is quite
invalid. The restriction of the labour duties of the serf did not
diminish, but rather increased the amount of work done in the
country. Forced labour, poor in quality and in quantity, was re­
duced so that the peasant would be free to improve his own bit of
land or work for hire. Most of the measures taken in favour of the
unfree peasant aimed, on the one hand, at increasing the intensity
of agricultural work, and, on the other, at freeing labour power for
industrial production. When the peasant-policy finally abolished
the forced labour of agricultural workers it did not abolish work but
470

L A B O U R.. L E G I S L A T I O N
increased its opportunities. The effect is quite different when modem
social policy 'regulates' working time by restricting the working day
to ten, nine, and eight hours a day, or, as in various categories of
public officials, to six hours or even less. For this reduces the amount
of work done and thus the yield of production.
The effect of such measures for the limitation of labour have been
too obvious to be overlooked. This is why all efforts to extend the
legal protection of labour in calling for a radical reconstruction of
conditions of work have encountered strong resistance. Etatist
writers generally talk as though the general shortening of working
time, the gradual elimination of women's and children's labour, and
the limitation of night work were to be ascribed exclusively to legis­
lative intervention and the activity of trade unions. 1 This attitude
shows that they are still influenced by the views on the character of
industrial wage labour held in circles unsympathetic to modern
capitalist industry. According to these views factory industry has a
peculiar aversion to using fully trained labour. It is supposed to
prefer the unskilled labourer, the weak woman, and the frail child
to the all-round trained expert. For on the one hand it wishes to
produce only inferior mass commodities, in the manufacture of
which it has no use for the skilled employee; on the other, the sim­
plicity of the movements involved in mechanical production enables
industry to employ the undeveloped and the physically weak. As
the factories are supposed to be profitable only if they under-pay the
workers, it is natural that they should employ unskilled workers,
women, and children and try to extend the working day as much as
possibl e. I t is s upposed that this view can be substantiated by re­
ferring to the evolution of large scale i ndustry . But in its beginnings
large scale industry had to be content with such labour because at
that time it could only employ labour outside the guild organization
of handicrafts. It had to take the untrained women and children
because they were the only ones available, and was forced to arrange

factories were lower than the earnings of handicraft workers because
the labour yield was lower. For the same reason the working-day
was longer than in the handicrafts. Only when in time these con­
ditions changed, could large scale industry change the conditions of
its labour. The factory had no other alternative than to employ
1

471

METHODS OF D E STR U CT I O N I S M

women and children in the beginning, fully trained workers not being
available; but when, by competition, it had vanquished the older
labour systems and had attracted to itself all the workers there em­
ployed, it altered its processes so that skilled male workers became
the main labour factor and women and children were forced more
and more out of industry. Wages rose, because the production of the
efficient worker was higher than the production of the factory girl
or child. The worker's family found that the wife and the children
did not need to earn. Working hours lessened because the more
intensive labour of the efficient worker made possible a better ex­
ploitation of the machinery than could be achieved with the sluggish
and unskilled work of inferior labour. 1
The shorter working day and the limitation of woman and child
labour, in so far as these improvements were in operation in Germany
about the outbreak of the War, were by no means a victory won by
the champions of the legal protection of labour from selfish entre­
preneurs. They were the result of an evolution in large scale industry
which, being no longer compelled to seek its workers on the fringe of
economic life, had to transform its working conditions to suit the
better quality of labour. On the whole, legislation has only antici­
pated changes which were maturing, or simply sanctioned those that
had already taken place. Certainly it has always tried to go further
than the development of industry allowed, but it has not been able
to maintain the struggle. It has been obstructed, not so much by the
resistance of entrepreneurs, as by the resistance of the workers them­
selves, a resistance not the less effective for being unvocal and little
advertised. For the workers themselves had to pay for every pro­
tective regulation, directly as well as indirectly. A restriction on
female and child labour burdened the workers' budget just as much
as a limitation of employment in adult labour. The reduction in the
supply of labour achieved by such measures does indeed raise the
marginal productivity of labour and thus the wage rate correspond­
ing to one unit of production. Whether this rise is sufficient to com­
pensate the worker for the burden of rising commodity prices is
1 This even Brentano has to admit, who otherwise boundlessly overvalues the effects

of labour legislation.

'The iIl1.perfect rrlachine had replaced the family father with
child labour . . . the perfected machine makes the father again the nourisher of family
and gives the child back to the school . . . Grown-up workers are now needed again and
only those can be used who, by their higher standard of living, are equal to the
heightened claim, of the machines. ' (Brentano, Uber das Verhiiltnis von Arbeitslohn
und Arbeitszeit zur AriJeitsleistulIg, 2nd Edition, Leipzi g 1 893, p. 4 3.)

47 2

LAB O U R

LE G I S LAT I ON

questionable. One would have to examine the data of each indi­
vidual example before forming any conclusions about this. It is
probable that the decline of production cannot bring an absolute
rise of real income to the worker. But we need not go into this in
detail. For one could only speak of a considerable reduction in the
supply of labour, brought about by labour laws, if these laws were
valid beyond a single country. As long as this was not so, as long
as every state proceeded on its own lines, and those countries, whose
recently developed industry took every opportunity to supplant the
industry of the older industrial states, were backward in promul­
gating labour-protection, then the worker's position in the market
could not be improved by labour protection. Efforts to generalize
labour protection by international treaties were intended to remedy
this. But of international labour protection, even more truly than of
the national movement, one may say that the process has not gone
beyond the stage which would have been reached in the normal
evolution of industry.
This attitude of destructionism emerges more clearly from the
theory than from the execution oflabour protection, for the danger to
industrial development implied in the regulations has to a certain
extent limited attempts to carry theory into practice. That the
theory of the exploitation of wage earners has spread and been so
rapidly accepted is due above all to destructionism, which has not
hesitated to use a technique for describing industrial working con­
ditions which can only be called emotional. The popular figures, the
hard-hearted entrepreneur and the grasping capitalist on the one
side, and the noble poor, the exploited worker on the other side, have,
so to speak, been introduced into the presuppositions of the legal
system. Legislators have been taught to see in every frustration of
the plans of an entrepreneur a victory of public welfare over the
selfish interests of parasitic individuals. The worker has been taught
to believe that he is toiling thanklessly for the profit of capital, and
that it is his duty to his class and to history to perform his work as
sluggishly as possible.
The theory of wages assumed by the advocates oflegal labour pro­
tection has many defects. They treat Seniors' arguments against the
legal regulation of working hours with contempt, but they produce
nothing relevant in refutation of the conclusions he reaches on the
assumption of stationary conditions. The inability of the 'Socialists

473

METHODS OF DESTRUCTIONISM

of the Chair' ('Katheder-socialist') school to understand economic
problems is particularly evident in Brentano. The idea that wages
correspond to the efficiency of labour is so far beyond his compre­
hension that he actually formulates a 'law' that a high wage
increases the product oflabour, whilst a low wage reduces it, although
nothing could be more clear than the fact that good work is paid
for at a higher rate than bad. 1 This mistake is again obvious when he
goes on to say that the shortening of working hours is a cause and not
a result of greater efficiency of labour.
Marx and Engels, the fathers of German Socialism, well under­
stood how fundamentally important to the spread of destructionist
ideas was the fight for labour legislation. The 'Inaugural Address of
the International Association of Workers' says that the English ten­
hour day was 'not only a great practical success; it was the victory
of a principle. For the first time the political economy of the bour­
geoisie was openly vanquished by the political economy of the work­
ing class'.' Over twenty years before, Engels had made an even more
candid admission of the destructionist nature of the Ten Hour Day
Bill. He could not help admitting that the counter-arguments of the
entrepreneurs were half true. The Bill would, he thought, depress
wages and make English industry unable to compete. But this did
not alarm him. 'Naturally,' he added, 'were the Ten Hour Day Bill
a final measure, England would be ruined, but because it necessarily
involves the passing of subsequent measures, which must lead Eng­
land into a path quite different from that she has travelled up till
now, it will mean progress," If English industry were to succumb
to foreign competition the revolution would be unavoidable.' In a
later essay he said of the Ten Hour Day Bill: 'It is no longer an
isolated attempt to lame industrial development. It is one link in a
long chain of measures which will transform the whole present form
of society and gradually destroy the former class conflicts. It is not
a reactionary but a revolutionary measure."

COMPULSORY SOCIAL INSURANCE

The fundamental importance of the fight for labour legislation
cannot be overestimated. But Marx and Engels and their liberal
opponents both overestimated the immediate destructive effects of
the particular measures. Destructionism advanced on other fronts.

§3
Compulsory social insurance
The essence of the programme of German etatism is social insur­
ance. But people outside the German Empire have also come to look
upon social insurance as the highest point to which the insight of the
statesman and political wisdom can attain. If some praise the
wonderful results of these institutions, others can only reproach them
for not going far enough, for not including all classes and for not
giving the favoured all that, in their opinion, they should have.
Social insurance, it was said, ultimately aimed at giving every citizen
adequate care and the best medical treatment in sickness and ade­
quate sustenance if he should become incapable of work through
accident, sickness or old age, or if he should fail to find work on con­
ditions he considered necessary.
No ordered community has callously allowed the poor and in­
capacitated to starve. There has always been some sort of institution
designed to save from destitution people unable to sustain themselves.
As general well-being has increased hand in hand with the develop­
ment of Capitalism, so too has the relief of the poor improved. Simul­
taneously the legal basis of this reliefhas changed. What was formerly
a charity on which the poor had no claim is now a duty of the com­
munity. Arrangements are made to ensure the support of the poor.
But at first people took care not to give the individual poor a legally
enforceable claim to support or sustenance. In the same way they
did not at once think of removing the slight stigma attaching to all
who were thus maintained by the community. This was not callous­
ness. The discussions which grew out of the English Poor Law in
particular show that people were fully conscious of the great social
dangers involved in every extension of poor relief.
German social insurance and the corresponding institutions of
other states are constructed on a very different basis. Maintenance
475

METHODS OF DESTRUCTIONISM

is a claim which the person entitled to it can enforce at law. The
claimant suffers no slur on his social standing. He is a State pen­
sioner like the king or his ministers or the receiver of an insurance
annuity, like anyone else who has entered into an insurance con­
tract. There is also no doubt that he is entitled to look on what he
receives as the equivalent of his own contributions. For the insurance
contributions are always at the expense of wages, immaterial of
whether they are collected from the entrepreneur or from the
workers. What the entrepreneur has to pay for the insurance is a
charge on labour's marginal productivity, it thus tends to reduce
the wages of labour. When the costs of maintenance are provided
out of taxes the worker clearly contributes towards them, directly
or indirectly.
To the intellectual champions of social insurance, and to the
politicians and statesmen who enacted it, illness and health appeared
as two conditions of the human body sharply separated fr�Iit each
other and always recognizable without difficulty or doubt. Any
doctor could diagnose the characteristics of 'health'. 'Illness' was a
bodily phenomenon which showed itself independently of human
will, and was not susceptible to influence by will. There were people
who for some reason or other simulated illness, but a doctor could
expose the pretence. Only the healthy person was fully efficient.
The efficiency of the sick person was lowered according to the gravity
and nature of his illness, and the doctor was able, by means of
objectively ascertainable physiological tests, to indicate the degree
"f the reduction of efficiency in percentages of normal efficiency.
Now every statement in this theory is false. There is no clearly
defined frontier between health and illness. Being ill is not a pheno­
menon independent of conscious will and of psychic forces working
in the subconscious. A man's efficiency is not merely the result of his
physical condition; it depends largely on his mind and will. Thus the
whole idea of being able to separate, by medical examination, the
unfit from the fit and from the malingerers, and those able to work
from those unable to work, proves to be untenable. Those who be­
lieved that accident and health insurance could be based on com­
pletely effective means of ascertaining illnesses and injuries and their
consequences were very much mistaken. The destructionist aspect
of accident and health insurance lies above all in the fact that such
institutions promote accidents and illness, hinder recovery, and very
476

C O M PU L S O R Y S O C I A L

I N S URA N C E

often create: or at any rate intensify and lengthen, the functional
disorders which follow illness or accident.
A special disease, traumatic neurosis, which had already appeared
in some cases as a result of the legal regulation of claims for compen­
sation for injury, has been thus turned into a national disease by
compulsory social insurance. No one any longer denies that trau­
matic neurosis is a re.sult of social legislation. Overwhelming
statistics show that insured persons take much longer time to recover
from their injuries than other persons, and that they are liable to
more extensions and permanent functional disturbances than those
of the uninsured. Insurance against diseases breeds disease. Indi­
vidual observation by doctors as well as statistics prove that recovery
from illnesses and injuries is much slower in officials and permanent
employees and people compulsorily insured than in members of the
professions and those not insured. The desire and the necessity of
becoming weB again and ready for work as soon as possible assist
recuperation to a degree so great as to be capable of demonstration. 1
To feel healthy is quite different from being healthy in the
medical sense, and a man's ability to work is largely independent of
the physiologically ascertainable and measurable performances of
his individual organs. The man who does not want to be healthy
is not merely a malingerer. He is a sick person. If the will to be
well and efficient is weakened, illness and inability to work is
caused. By weakening or completely destroying the will to be well
and able to work, social insurance creates illness and inability to
work; it produces the habit of complaining - which is in itself a
neurosis - and neuroses of other kinds. In short, it is an institution
which tends to encourage disease, not to say accidents, and to in­
tensify considerably the physical and psychic results of accidents and
illnesses. As a social institution it makes a people sick bodily and
mentally or at least helps to multiply, lengthen, and intensify
disease.
The psychic forces which are active in every living thing, includ­
ing man , in the form of a will to health and a desire to work, are not
independent of social surroundings. Certain circumstances streng­
then them, others weaken them. The sociai environment of an

METHOD S OF DESTRUCTIONISM
African tribe living by hunting is decidedly calculated to stimulate
these forces. The same is true of the quite different environment of
the citizens of a capitalist society, based on division of labour and
on private property. On the other hand a social order weakens
these forces when it promises that if the individual's work is hindered
by illness or the effects of a trauma he shall live without work or with
little work and suffer no very noticeable reduction in his income.
Matters are not so simple as they appear to the naive pathology of
the army or prison doctor.
Social insurance has thus made the neurosis of the insured a
dangerous public disease. Should the institution be extended and
developed the disease will spread. No reform can be of any assis­
tance. We cannot weaken or destroy the will to health without
producing illness.

Trade unions
The fundamental problem for the appreciation of the economic
and social consequences of trade unionism is the question whether
labour can succeed, within a market economy, by association and
by collective bargaining, in getting high wages lastingly and for all
workers. To this question, economic theory - both the classic
(including its marxist wing), and the modern (including its socialist
wing too) - answers categorically in the negative. Public opinion
believes that the facts have proved the efficiency of trade unionism
to improve the conditions of labour, because the standard of living
of the masses has been steadily rising in the last hundred years. But
economists explain this fact in an absolutely different way. Accord­
ing to them, this improvement is due to the progress of capitalism,
to the progressive accumulation of capital and to its corollary, the
increase of the marginal productivity of labour. And there is no
doubt that we must give more credit to the views of the economists,
substantiated as they are by the actual course of events, than to the
naive belief of men who simply argue post hoc ergo propter hoc. It is
true that this fundamental point has been entirely misunderstood
by many thousands of worthy labour leaders, who have devoted their
life work to the organization of trade unions, and by many eminent

478

TRADE UNIONS

philanthropists who have advocated trade unionism as the corner·
stone of future society. It was the true tragedy of the age of capital·
ism that this attitude was wrong and that trade unionism developed
into the most important weapon of destructionist policy. Socialist
ideology has so successfully obscured the nature and peculiarity of
the trade union that nowadays it is difficult to envisage what trade
unions are and what they do. People are still inclined to treat the
problem of workers' associations as if it were a question of the
freedom to combine and the right to strike. But there has been no
question for decades now of whether the workers shall be granted
liberty to form associations or whether they shall have the right to
cease work, even in violation of a labour contract. No legislation
denies them this right, for the legal damages which might devolve
upon individual workers for stopping work in breach of contract
have no importance in practice. Thus even the most extreme
advocates of destructionism have hardly bothered to claim for the
worker the right to break contractual obligations at will. When in
recent years some countries, and among them Great Britain, the
cradle of modern trade unionism, tried to limit the power of trade
union policy, it was not part of their purpose to do away with what
they considered the non-political action of trade unionism. The
Act of 1 92 7 attempted to outlaw general strikes and sympathetic
strikes, but did not in any way interfere either with the freedom of
association or with the strike for the sake of obtaining better rates
of pay.
The general strike has always been considered, both by its
supporters and by its opponents, as a revolutionary measure, or even
as the essence of revolution itself. The vital element in the general
strike is the more or less complete paralysis of the economic life of
the community in order to bring about certain desired ends. How
successful a general strike can be was proved when the Kapp
Putsch, supported both by die German legal army and by a great
illegal armed force which had compelled the Government to flee
from the capital, was defeated in a few days by the general strike.
In this case the weapon of the general strike was used to defend
democracy. But whether one finds the political attitude of organized
labour sympathetic or not, is of no consequence. The fact is that in
a country where trade unionism is strong enough to set in motion a
general strike, the supreme power is in the hands of trade unions
479

METHODS OF DESTR U CTIONISM

and not in the hands of parliament and the government dependent
on it. It was the comprehension of the real meaning of trade union­
ism and its working which inspired the French Syndicalists with
their basic idea that violence is the means which political parties
must use if they want to come to power. It should never be for­
gotten that the philosophy of violence, which replaced the concilia­
tory teaching of liberalism and democracy, started as a philosophy
of trade unionism. Syndicalism is nothing else but the French word
for trade unionism. The glorification of violence which characterizes
the policy of Russian Sovietism, of Italian Fascism and of German
Nazism, and which to-day seriously threatens all democratic
governments, sprang from the teachings of revolutionary syndicalists.
The essence of the trade union problem is the compulsion to coalesce
and to strike. The unions claim the right to force out of employment
all those who refuse to combine with them or those to whom they
have refused membership. They claim the right to stop work at will,
and to prevent anyone from taking the place of the strikers. They
claim the right to prevent and punish by violence the contravention
of their decisions, and to take all steps to organize this violent action
so that its success shall be assured.
Every association becomes more cumbrous and prudent when
the men at its head have grown old. Fighting associations lose the
desire to attack and the ability to overcome their opponents by
swift action. The armies of military powers, above all the armies of
Austria and Prussia have learned over and over again that victory
is difficult under old leaders. The Unions are no exception to the rule.
So it may come about that some of the older and fully developed
trade unions have temporarily lost some of their destructionist lust
for attack and readiness for battle. Thus when the aged resist the
destructive policy of impetuous youth, an instrument of destruction
becomes for the moment an instrument which supports the status quo.
It is just on this ground that the radicals have continually reproached
the trade unions, and it is just this plea which the trade unions have
themselves put forward when they have wanted help from the non­
socialist classes of the community in their work of extending com­
pulsory unionism. These pauses for breath in the trade unions'
destructive fights have always been short. Over and over again those
who triumphed were those who advocated an uninterrupted con­
tinuation of the fight against the capitalist social order. The violent
480

TRADE

UNIONS

elements have either pushed out the old trade union leaders or
erected new organizations in the place of the old. It could not be
otherwise. For, consistently with the idea on which they have de­
veloped, the associations of workers in trade unions are only imagin­
able as a weapon of destruction. We have shown that the solidarity
of the members of the trade union can be founded only on the idea
of a war to destroy the social order based on private ownership in
the means of production. The basic idea and not merely the
practice of the trades unions is destructionist.
The cornerstone of trade unionism is compulsory membership.
The workers refuse to work with men who belong to an organization
not recognized by themselves. They exclude the non-union men by
threatening to strike or, ultimately, by striking. Those who refuse
to join the union are sometimes compelled to do so by rough handling.
It is not necessary to dilate upon the drastic violation of the liberty"
of the individual which this implies. Even the sophistries of advo­
cates of trade union destructionism have not succeeded in reassuring
public opinion on this point. When from time to time specially gross
examples of violence against a non-union worker get publicity, even
those newspapers which otherwise stand more or less on the side of
the destructionist parties are moved to protest.
The weapon of the trade union is the strike. It must be borne in
mind that every strike is an act of coercion, a form of extortion, a
measure of violence directed against all who might act in opposition
to the strikers' intentions. For the purpose of the strike would be
defeated if the entrepreneur were able to employ others to do the
work of the strikers, or if only a section of the workers joined the
strike. The long and the short of trade union rights is in fact the
right to proceed against the strike-breaker with primitive violence,
and this right the workers have successfully maintained. How
thi'l right was established by the trade unions in various countries
does not concern us here. It is sufficient to say that in the last
decades it has been established everywhere, less by explicit legislative
sanction than by the tacit toleration of public authority and the law.
For years it has hardly been possible to break a strike in any part of
Europe by employing"strike-breakers . For a long time it w� it least
possible to avoid strikes on railways, lighting and water services, and
the most important urban food supply enterprises. But here, too,
destructionism has at last carried the day.
48 1

METHODS OF DESTRUCTIONISM
No one has seriously contested the destructionist function of
trade unionism. There has never yet been a wage-theory from which
one could deduce that association by means of trade unions led to a
permanent increase in the real income of the workers. Certainly
Marx was far from allowing that trade unions had any effect on
wages. In a speech made in 1 865 before the General Council of the
'International' l Marx tried to win over his comrades to joint action
with the trade unions. His introductory words reveal his object in
doing so. The view that increase of wages could not be obtained by
strikes - a view represented in France by the Prudhonists, in Ger­
many by the Lassallians - was, he said, 'most unpopular with the
working class'. But his great qualities as a tactician, which a year
before had enabled him in his 'Inaugural Address' to weld into one
unitary programme the most diverse opinions upon the nature,
aims, and tasks of the labour movement, were now again brought
'
into play, and as he \\'as anxious to link up the trade union mo�e­
ment with the International, he produced everything that can be
said in favour of trade unions. Nevertheless he is careful not to com­
mit himself to a statement that the workers' economic position could
be directly improved through the trade unions. As he sees it, the
foremost task of the trade unions is to lead the fight against Capital­
ism. The position he assigns to trade unions admits of no doubt as
to the results he expects from their intervention. 'In place of the
conservative motto: 'A just day's wage for a just day's work' they
ought to print on their banners, 'Abolition of the wage system' They generally miss their aim because they limit themselves to carry­
ing on a guerilla war against the consequences of the present system,
instead of working at the same time for its transformation and em­
ploying their organized power as a lever for the final emancipation of
the working classes ; that is, for the final abolition of the wage system.' I
Marx could hardly have said more plainly that he could see nothing
more in the trade unions than tools for the destruction of the capitalist
social order. It remained for the 'realistic' economists and re­
visionist Marxians to assert that the trade unions were able to main­
tain wages permanently above the level at which they would have
stood without trade unionism. There is no need to argue the point,

TRADE UNIONS
for no attempt was made even to develop a theory from it. It
remains an assertion which is always made without any reference to
the interdependence of economic factors and without any sort of
proof.
The policy of strike, violence, and sabotage can claim no merit
whatever for any improvement in the workers' position. 1 It has
helped to shake to the foundations the skilfully constructed edifice
of the capitalist economy, in which the lot of everyone down to the
poorest worker has been continually rising. And it has operated not
in the interests of Socialism but in that of Syndicalism.
If workers in the so-called non-vital industries succeed in their
demand for wages above the level given by the situation on the
market, there ensues a dislocation which sets in motion forces that
lead finally to a readjustment of the market's disturbed equilibrium.
If, however, the workers in vital industries are able to enforce bv
strikes or threat of strikes their demands for higher wages, and t �
claim all those rights claimed in the wage struggle by other workers,
the position is altogether different. It would be misleading to say
that those workers were then virtually monopolists, for the question
here lies outside the concept of economic monopoly. If the employees
of all transport undertakings strike and circumvent action which
might weaken the intended effect of their strike, they are absolute
tyrants of the territories under their dominion. Onc may say, of
course, that they make a sober use of their power, but this does not
alter the fact that they have the power. That being so, there are
only two classes in the country : members of the trade unions for the
branches of production essential to life, and the remainder of the
people, who are slaves without rights. We arrive at a position where
'the indispensable workers dominate the remaining classes by the
rule of violence' 2
And, speaking once again of power it may be well to inquire at
this point on what this power, in common with all other power, is
based. The power of the workers organized in trade unions, before
which the world now trembles, has precisely the same foundations
.

as the power of any other tyrants at any time; it is nothing more
than the product of human ideologies. For decades it was impressed
upon people that the association of workers in trade unions was
necessary and useful to the individual as well as to the community,
that only the wicked selfishness of exploiters could think of combating
the unions, that in strikes the strikers were always right, that there
could hardly be a worse infamy than strike-breaking, and that
attempts to protect those willing to work were anti-social. The
generations which grew up in the last decades have been taught
from childhood that membership of a trade union was a worker's
most important social duty. A strike came to mean a sort of holy
action, a social ordinance. On this ideology rests the power of the
workers' association. It would break down if the theory of its social
utility were superseded by other views on the effects of trade union­
ism. Plainly, therefore, it is precisely the most powerful unions which
are obliged to use their power sparingiy, since, by putting an undue
strain on society, they might cause people to reflect upon the nature
and effect of trade unionism and so lead to a re-examination and
rejection of these theories. This, of course, is and always has been
true of all holders of power and is no peculiarity of the trade unions.
For this surely is clear: that should there ever be a thorough
discussion upon the right of the workers in vital industries to strike,
the whole theory of trade unionism and compulsory strikes would
soon collapse and such strike-breaking associations as the 'Technische
Nothilfe' would receive the applause which to-day goes to the strikers.
It is possible that in the ensuing conflict society would be destroyed.
On the other hand, it is certain that a society which aims at pre­
serving trade unionism on its present lines is in a fair way towards
destroying itself.

Unemployment insurance
Assistance of the unemployed has proved to be one of the most
effective weapons of destructionism.
The reasoning which brought about unemployment insurance
was the same as that which led to the setting up of insurance against
sickness and accident. Unemployment was held to be a misfortune
484

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
which overwhelmed men like an avalanche. It occurred to no one
that lack of wages would be a better term than lack of employment,
for what the unemployed person misses is not work but the re­
muneration of work. The point was not that the 'unemployed'
could not find work, but that they were not willing to work at the
wages they could get in the labour market for the particular work
they were able and willing to perform.
The value of health and accident insurance becomes problematic
by reason of the possibility that the insured person may himself
bring about, or at least intensify, the condition insured against.
But in the case of unemployment insurance, the condition insured
against can never develop unless the insured persons so will. If they
did not act as trade unionists, but reduced their demands and
changed their locations and occupations according to the require­
ments of the labour market, they could eventually find work. For
as long as we live in the real world and not in the Land of Heart's
Desire, labour will be a scarce good, that is, there will be an un­
satisfied demand for labour. Unemployment is a problem of wages,
not of work. It is just as impossible to insure against unemployment
as it would be to insure against, say, the unsaleability of commodities.
Unemployment insurance is definitely a misnomer. There can
never be any statistical foundation for such an insurance. Most
countries have acknowledged this by dropping the name 'insurance',
or at least by ignoring its implications. It has now become un­
disguised 'assistance'. It enables the trade unions to keep wages up
to a rate at which only a part ofthose seeking work can be employed.
Therefore, the assistance of the unemployed is what first creates un­
employment as a permanent phenomenon. At present many Euro­
pean states are devoting to the purpose sums that considerably
exceed the capacity of their public finances.
The fact that there exists in almost every country permanent
mass unemployment is considered by public opinion as conclusive
proof that Capitalism is incapable of solving the economic problem,
and that therefore government interference, totalitarian planning and
Socialism are necessary. And t.his argument is regarded as irrefutable
when people realize that the only big country which does not suffer
from the evils of unemployment is communist Russia. The logic of
this argument however, is very weak. Unemployment in the capi­
talist countries is due to the fact that the policy both of the govern-

485

-

METHODS OF DESTRUCTIONISM
ments and of the trade unions aims at maintaining a level of wages
which is out of harmony with the existing productivity of labour.
It is true that as far as we can see there is no large scale unemploy­
ment in Russia. But the standard of living of the Russian worker is
much lower than the standard of living even of the unemployed dole
receiver in the capitalist countries of the West. If the British or
Continental workers were ready to accept wages which would indeed
be lower than their present wages but which would still be several
times higher than the wages of the Russian worker, unemployment
would disappear in these countries too. Unemployment in the
capitalist countries is not a proof of the insufficiency of the capitalist
system, nor is the absence of unemployment in Russia a proof of
the efficiency of the communist system. But the fact that there is
unemployment as a mass phenomenon in almost every capitalist
country is nevertheless the most formidable menace to the con­
tinuance of the capitalist system. Permanent mass unemployment
destroys the moral foundations of the social order. The young people
who, having finished their training for work, are forced to remain
idle, are the ferment out of which the most radical political move­
ments are formed. In their ranks the soldiers of the coming revolu­
tions are recruited.
This indeed is the tragedy of our situation. The friends of trade
unionism and of the policy of unemployment doles honestly believe
that there is no way to ensure the maintenance of fair conditions of
life for the masses other than the policy of the trade unions. They do
not see that in the long run all efforts to raise wages above a level
corresponding to the market reflection of the marginal productivity
of the labour concerned must lead to unemployment, and that in
the long run unemployment doles can have no other effect than the
perpetuation of unemployment. They do not see that the remedies
which they recommend for the relief of the victims - doles and
public works - lead to consumption of capital, and that finally
capital consumption necessitates a lowering of the wage level still
further. Under present conditions it is clear that it would not be
feasible to abolish the dole and the other less important provisions
for the relief of the unemployed, public works and so on, at one
single stroke. It is indeed one of the principal drawbacks of every
kind of interventionism that it is so difficult to reverse the process ­
that its abolition gives rise to problems which it is almost impossible
486

I

SOCIALIZATION
to solve in a completely satisfactory way. At the present day the
great problem of statesmanship is how to find a way out of this
labyrinth of interventionist measures. For what has been done in
recent years has been nothing else than a series of attempts to conceal
the effects of an economic policy which has lowered the productivity
of labour. What is now needed is first of all a return to a policy
which ensures the higher productivity of labour. This includes
clearly the abandonment of the whole policy of protectionism,
import duties and quotas. It is necessary to restore to labour the
possibility to move freely from industry to industry and from
country to country.
J t is not Capitalism which is responsible for the evils of per­
manent mass unemployment, but the policy which paralyses its
working.

§6
Socialization
Under Liberalism, state-owned factories and production by
the State were abolished. The postal service was practically
the only exception to the general principle that the means of
production should be left to private ownership and every economic
activity made over to the private citizen. The advocates of etatism
have gone to a lot of trouble to set forth the reasons which they sup­
pose to favour the nationalization of the postal and the related tele­
graph service. In the first place they put forward political arguments.
But in such discussions of the pros and cons of state control of the
post and telegraph system, two things are generally lumped to­
gether which ought to be considered separately: the questions of
unifying the service and of transferring it exclusively to the State.
No one denies that the post and telegraph systems afford excellent
facilities for unification, and that, even if they were left perfectly
free, trusts would inevitably be formed, leading to a defacto monopoly
of individuals over whole territories at least. With no other enter­
prises are the advantages of concentration more obvious. But to
admit this is not by any means to decide whether the State is to be
granted a legally assured monopoly for all branches of such services.
It could easily be demonstrated that State management works un48 7

METHODS OF DESTRUCTIONISM
economically, that it is slow to extend the facilities for the transmis­
sion of letters and parcels in accordance with business requirements,
and that it can only with difficulty be persuaded to introduce
practical improvements. The great progress in this sphere of
economic life has been achieved by private enterprise. We owe
largely to private enterprise the development on a large scale of
overland telegraphy: in England this was nationalized only in 1 869,
in the U .S.A. it is still in the hands of joint stock companies. Sub­
marine cables are mostly in the hands of private enterprise. Even
German etatism showed hesitation in 'freeing' the State from col­
laboration with private enterprise in deep sea telegraphy. The
liberals of that time also advocated the principle of full freedom in
post and telegraph services and attempted with great success to
expose the inadequacy of State enterprise. 1 That nevertheless these
branches of production have not been denationalized is to be
ascribed oniy to the fact that those hoiding poiiticai power need the
post and telegraph to control public opinion.
The military powers, everywhere ready to hinder the entre­
preneur, have acknowledged his superiority by handing over to him
the production of arms and munitions. The great advances in war
technique date from the moment when private enterprise began to
produce war material. The State has had to recognize that the
entrepreneur produces better arms than the civil servant; this was
proved on the battlefields in a way that enlightened even the most
stubborn advocate of state production. In the nineteenth century
arsenals and state shipyards disappeared almost completely, or
were transformed into mere magazines, and their place was taken
by private enterprises. Literary and parliamentary supporters of
the nationalization of industry had scant success with their demand
for the nationalization of the armaments industry, even in the most
flourishing days of etatism in the years immediately preceding the
World War. The general staffs knew well the superiority of the
private undertaking.
For reasons of public finance, certain revenue monopolies which
had existed from a distant past were not abolished even during the
epoch of Liberal�m. They remained because they were looked upon
as a convenient way of collecting a tax on consumption. But people

had no illusions about the uneconomic nature of state enterprise ­
in the administration of the tobacco monopolies, for example. But
before Liberalism could carry its victorious principle into this field,
Socialism had already introduced a retrograde movement.
The ideas from which sprang the first modern nationalizations
and municipalizations were not altogether inspired by modern
Socialism. In the origins of the movement, ideas of the old police
state and purely military and political considerations played a great
part. But soon the socialist ideology became dominant. It was a
conscious socialization that was carried out by states and munici­
palities. The slogan was: away with uneconomic private enterprise,
away with private ownership.
At first the economic inferiority of socialist production did not
hinder the progress of nationalization and municipalization. The
voice of caution was not heard. It was lost in the shouting of
etatists, socialists, and aB the elements whose interests were at stake.
People did not choose to see the faults of government enterprise, and
so overlooked them. Only one circumstance restricted the excessive
zeal of the enemies of private property - the financial difficulties
with which a large number of public undertakings had to contend.
For political reasons the government could not completely pass on
to consumers the higher costs of State management, and working
losses were therefore frequent. Its supporters consoled themselves
by stating that the general economic and social political advantages
of state and municipal enterprise were well worth the sacrifice. All
the same, it became necessary to proceed cautiously with the
etatistic policy. The embarrassment in which economists writing on
these problems found themselves became evident from their reluc­
tance to ascribe the financial failure of public enterprises to the un­
economic methods of this kind of enterprise. They tried instead to
account for it by some special circumstance, such as personal mis­
takes in the management and errors in organization. And they
pointed repeatedly to the Prussian State railways as the most
brilliant model of a good administration. Of course the Prussian
State railways have yielded good working surpluses. But there were
speciai reasons. Prussia acquired the most important part of its
State railway system in the first half of the ' eighties, that is at a time
of specially low prices, and the whole system was equipped and
expanded to a large extent before the rapid growth of German

489

MET HODS

OF DESTRUCT IONISM

industrial prosperity which set in during the second half of the
'nineties. Thus there was nothing particularly remarkable in the
fact that these railways paid well, for their loads grew from year to
year without any solicitation, they ran mostly through plains, they
had coal on every hand, and could count on favourable running
conditions. Their situation was such that they could yield profits
for a while although run by the State. It was the same with the gas,
water, and electricity works and with the tramway systems of several
large cities. The conclusions generally drawn from this were, how­
ever, far from accurate.
Generally speaking, the result of nationalization and munici­

palization was that taxation had to contribute to running costs. So
it may be said that no catchword has ever been made public at so
inappropriate a moment as Goldscheid's slogan of 'the suppression
of the taxation state' . Goldscheid thinks that the financial troubles
into which the Worid War and its consequences have ianded the State
can no longer be remedied by the old methods of public finance.
The taxation of private enterprise is failing. Therefore, one must
start to 'repropriate' the State by expropriating capitalist enterprises,
so that the State will be able to cover its expenses out of the profits
of its own undertakings. 1 Here we have the cart before the horse.
The financial difficulties result from the fact that taxation can no
longer pay the large contributions required by socialist enterprises.
Were all enterprises socialized, the form of the evil would indeed be
changed, but far from being abolished it would be intensifie d. The
smaller yield of the public enterprises would no longer be visible in
a budget deficit, it is true, but the population would be worse off.
Distress and misery would increase, not diminish. To remove the
State's financial troubles Goldscheid proposes to carry socialization
to the bitter end . But this financial trouble has come about because
socialization has already gone too far. It will vanish only when
socialized enterprises are returned to private ownership. Socialism
has arrived at a point where the impossibility of carrying out its
technique is apparent to all, where even the blind begin to see that
it is hastening the decline of all civilization. The effort made in
Centrai Europe to sociaiize completely at a single stroke was wrecked

not by the resistance of the bourgeoisie, but by the fact that further
socialization was quite impossible from a financial point of view. The
systematic, cool and deliberate socialization practised by states and
municipalities up to the war, came to a standstill because the result
to which it was leading became all too clear. The attempt to pass it
off under a different name, as the socialization commission in Ger­
many and Austria tried to do, could have no success in these circum­
stances. If the work of socialization had to be carried on, it was not
possible to do so by the old methods. The voice of reason which
warned men not to venture any further on this path must be
silenced, criticism must be obliterated by the intoxication of
enthusiasm and fanaticism, opponents must be killed, as there was
no other way of refuting them. Bolshevism and Spartacism were
the last weapons of Socialism. In this sense they are the inevitable
outcome of the policy of destructionism.

Taxation
For classical nineteenth-century Liberalism, which assigns to the
State the sole task of safeguarding the citizen's property and person,
the problem of raising the means needed for public services is a
matter of small importance. The expenditure caused by the appara­
tus of a liberal community is so small, compared with the total
national income, that there is little appreciable difference between
meeting it one way or another. If the liberal writers of that period
have been concerned to find the best form of taxation, they have done
so because they wish to arrange every detail of the social system in the
most effective way, not because they think that public finance is one
of the main problems of society. They have of course to take into
account the fact that nowhere in the world have their ideas been
realized, and that the hope of seeing them completely realized in the
near future is slender. They see clear evidence of liberal develop­
ment everywhere, they believe that the distant future belongs to
Liberalism; but the forces of the past still seem sufficiently strong to
inhibit its progress, though no longer strong enough to stop it com­
pletely, let alone suppress it. There still exist schemes for violence
and conquest, there are standing armies, secret diplomatic treaties,

wars, tariffs, State interference in trade and industry - in short,
interventionism of every kind in home and foreign policy. So, for a
considerable time to come, the nations must be prepared to allow
considerable sums for governmental expenditure. Though questions
of taxation would be of minor importance in the purely liberal state,
they call for increased attention in the authoritarian state in which
liberal politicians of their time have to work. In the first place,
therefore, they recommend that State expenditure shall be restricted.
But if they do not completely succeed in this they must decide how
the necessary funds are to be raised without more harm than is
absolutely necessary.
Liberal taxation proposals must necessarily be misunderstood
unless it is realized that liberal politicians look on every tax as an
evil - though up to a point an unavoidable one - and that they pro­
ceed from the supposition that one must try to keep State expenditure
down to a minimum. When they recommend a certain tax, or, to
speak more correctly, call it less harmful than other taxes, they
always have in mind the raising of only a relatively small sum. A
low rate of taxation is an integral part of all liberal programmes of
taxation. This alone explains their attitude towards the income tax,
which they were the first to introduce into serious discussions on
public finance, and their willingness to agree that a modest minimum
of subsistence shall be free from taxation and the rate of taxation on
small incomes lowered. 1
The socialist financial policy also is only a temporary one, its
validity being limited to the period of transition. For the Socialist
State, where all means of production belong to society and all
income finds its way in the first place to the State coffers, questions
of finance and taxation do not exist at all in the sense in which the
social order based on private property has to deal with them. Those
forms of the socialist community which, like State Socialism, intend
to allow private property to continue in name and in outward form,
would not really need to levy taxes either, although they might
retain the name and legal form of taxation. They would simply
decree how much of the social income obtained in the individual
enterprises should remain ,vith the nominal Olvner and ho\-v much
should be handed over to the State. There would not be any question

here of a taxation which imposes certain obstacles in individual
businesses, but leaves the market to deal with its effect upon the
prices of commodities and wages, on profits, interest, and rents.
Questions of public finance and the policy of taxation exist only where
there is private ownership in the means of production.
But for socialists, too, the public finance problems of capitalist
society increase in importance as the period of transition becomes
more and more prolonged. This is inevitable, seeing that they are
continually trying to expand the area of the State's tasks and that
there is consequently an increase in expenditure. They thus take
over the responsibility of increasing the income of the State. The
socialist policy has become the decisive factor in the development of
government expenditure, socialist demands regulate the policy of
taxation and in the socialist programme itself public finance comes
more and more into the foreground. Whilst in the liberal programme
the basic principle is a low rate of taxation, the socialists think a tax
is better the heavier it is.
Classical economics achieved much in the theory of the incidence
of taxes. This must be admitted in spite of all the faults of its ba'!ic
theory of value. When liberal politicians criticized existing con­
ditions and proposed reforms they started from the masterly pro­
positions of Riccardo's admirable investigations on this subject.
Socialist politicians have taken things much more easily. They had
no new opinions of their own, and from the classical writers they took
merely what they needed for the politics of the moment - isolated
remarks, torn from their context and dealing mainly with the
incidence of taxes on consumption. They improvized a rough
system which nowhere penetrated to the main problem, but had the
virtue of being so simple that the masses could understand it. Taxes
were to be paid by the rich, the entrepreneurs, the capitalists, in
short, by 'the others' ; the workers, that is the electors whose votes
were what mattered at the moment, should remain tax free. All
taxes on mass consumption, even on alcoholic drinks, were to be
rejected, because they burdened the people. Direct taxes could be
as high as the government wished to make them, as long as the
incomes and possessions of the workers were left alone. Not for one
moment does it occur to the advocates of this popular taxation
policy that direct taxes and taxes on trade may start a chain of
events that will force down the standard of living of the very classes

493

O F DESTRU C T I O N I SM

whose alleged special interests they claim to represent. Seldom does
anyone ask whether the restriction of capital formation which
results from the taxation of property may not harm the non-pro­
pertied members of society as well. More and more the policy of
taxation evolves into a policy of confiscation. The aim on which it
concentrates is to tax out of existence every kind of fortune and
income from property, in which process property invested in trade
and industry, in shares and bonds, is generally treated more ruth­
lessly than property in land. Taxation becomes the favourite weapon
of interventionism.

Taxation laws no longer aim exclusively or

predominantly at increasing State revenues ; they are intended to
serve other purposes besides fiscal requirements.

Sometimes their

relation to public finance vanishes completely and they fulfil an
entirely different function. Some taxes seem to be inflicted as
punishment for behaviour that is considered injurious ; the tax on
big stores is intended to make it more difficult for big stores to com­
pete with small shops; the taxes on stock exchange transactions are
designed to restrict speculation. The dues become so numerous and
varied that in making business transactions a man must first of all
consider what the effect on his taxation will be. Innumerable
economic projects lie fallow because the load of taxation would make
them unprofitable. Thus in many states the high duties on founding,
maintaining, amalgamating, and liquidating joint stock companies
seriously restrict the development of the system.
Nothing is more calculated to make a demagogue popular than a
constantly reiterated demand for heavy taxes on the rich. Capital
levies and high income taxes on the larger incomes are extraordinarily
popular with the masses, who do not have to pay them. The assessors
and collectors go about their business with positive enthusiasm; they
are intent upon increasing the taxpayer's liability by the subtleties
of legal interpretation.
The destructionist policy of taxation culminates in capital levies.
Property is expropriated and then consumed . Capital is transformed
into goods for use and for consumption. The effect of all this should
be plain to see. Yet the whole popular theory of taxation to-day
l eads to the same result.
Confiscations of capital through the legal form of taxation are
neither socialistic nor a means to Socialism. They lead, not to
socialization of the means of production, but to consumption of

494

INFLATION
capital.

Only when they are set within a socialist system, which

retains the name and form of private property, are they a part of
Socialism.

In 'War Socialism' they supplemented the compulsory

economic system and were instrumental in determining the evolution
of the whole system towards Socialism. 1 In a socialist system where
the means of production are totally and formally socialized, there
could in principle be no more taxes on property or income from pro­
perty. When the socialist community levies dues from its members
this in no way alters the disposal of the means of production.
Marx has spoken unfavourably of efforts to alter the social order
by measures of taxation. He emphatically insisted that taxation
reform alone could not replace Socialism. 2 His views on the effect
of taxes within the capitalist order were also different from those of
the ordinary run of socialists. He said on one occasion, that to assert
that 'the income tax does not affect the workers' was 'truly absurd'.
'In our present social order, where entrepreneurs and workers stand
opposed, the bourgeoisie generally compensates itself for higher
taxation by reducing wages or raising prices' . 3 But the communist
manifesto had already demanded 'a heavy progressive tax' and the
social democratic party's demands in taxation have always been the
most radical.

In that field also, therefore, it is moving towards

destructionism.

§8
Inflation
Inflation is the last word in destructionism. The Bolshevists,
with their inimitable gift for rationalizing their resentments and
interpreting defeats as victories, have represented their financial
policy as an effort to abolish Capitalism by destroying the institution
of money. But although inflation does indeed destroy Capitalism, it
does not do away with private property. It effects great changes of
fortune and income, it destroys the whole finely organized mechan­
ism of production based on division of labour, it can cause a relapse
into an economy without trade if the use of metal money or at least

of barter trade is not maintained. But it cannot create anything, not
even a socialist order of society.
By destroying the basis of reckoning values - the possibility of
calculating with a general denominator of prices which, for short
periods at least, does not fluctuate too wildly - inflation shakes the
system of calculations in terms of money, the most important aid to
economic action which thought has evolved. As long as it is kept
within certain limits, inflation is an excellent psychological support
ofan economic policy which lives on the consumption of capital. In the
usual, and indeed the only possible, kind of capitalist book-keeping,
inflation creates an illusion of profit where in reality there are only
losses. As people start off from the nominal sum of the erstwhile cost
price, they allow too little for depreciation on fixed capital, and since
they take into account the apparent increases in the value of circu­
lating capital as if these increases were real increases of value, they
show profits where accounts in a stable currency would reveal losses. 1
This is certainly not a means of abolishing the effects of an evil
etatistic policy, of war and revolution; it merely hides them from the
eye of the multitude. People talk of profits, they think they are living
in a period of economic progress, and finally they even applaud the
wise policy which apparently makes everyone richer.
But the moment inflation passes a certain point the picture
changes. It begins to promote destructionism not merely indirectly
by disguising the effects of destructionist policy; it becomes in itself
one of the most important tools of destructionism. It leads everyone
to consume. his fortune; it discourages saving, and thereby prevents
the formation of fresh capital. It encourages the confiscatory policy
of taxation. The depreciation of money raises the monetary ex­
pression of commodity values and this, reacting on the book values
of changes in capital - which the tax administration regard as
increases in income and capital - becomes a new legal justification
for confiscation of part of the owners' fortune. References to the
apparently high profits which entrepreneurs can be shown to be
making, on a calculation assuming that the value of money remains
stable, offers an excellent means of stimulating popular frenzy. In
this way, one can easily represent all entrepreneurial activity as
profiteering, swindling, and parasitism. And the chaos which
follows, the money system collapsing under the avalanche of

MARXISM AND DESTRUCTIONISM
continuous issues of additional notes, gives a favourable opportunity
for completing the work of destruction.
The destructionist policy of interventionism and Socialism has
plunged the world into great misery. Politicians are helpless in the
face of the crisis they have conjured up. They cannot recommend
any way out except more inflation or, as they call it now, reflation.
Economic life is to be 'cranked up again' by new bank credits (that is,
by additional 'circulation' credit) as the moderates demand, or by
the issue offresh government paper money, which is the more radical
programme.
But increases in the quantity of money and fiduciary media will
not enrich the world or build up what destructionism has tom down.
Expansion of credit does lead to a boom at first, it is true, but sooner
or later this boom is bound to crash and bring about a new depres­
sion. Only apparent and temporary relief can be won by tricks of
banking and currency. In the long run they must land the nation
in profounder catastrophe. For the damage such methods inflict on
national well-being is all the heavier, the longer people have managed
to deceive themselves with the illusion of prosperity which the con­
tinuous creation of credit has conjured Up. l

§9
Marxism and destructionism
Socialism has not consciously willed the destruction of society. It
believed it was creating a higher form of society. But since a socialist
society is not a possibility every step towards it must destroy society.
It is the history of Marxian Socialism which shows most clearly
that every socialist policy must turn into destructionism. Marxism
described Capitalism as the inevitable preliminary to Socialism, and
looked forward to the new society only as the result of Capitalism's
fruition. If we take our stand on this part of Marx's theory - it is
true that he has put forward other theories with which this is com­
pletely incompatible - then the policy of all the parties that claim
Marx's authority is quite non-marxian. The Marxians ought to
have combated everything that could in any way hinder the develop­
ment of Capitalism. They should have protested against the trade

unions and their methods, against laws protecting labour, against
compulsory social insurance, against the taxation of property; they
should have fought laws hindering the full working of the stock and
produce exchanges, the fixation of prices, the policy which proceeds
against cartels and trusts ; they should have resisted inflationism.
But they have done the reverse of all this, have been content to
repeat Marx's condemnation of the 'petty bourgeois' policy, without
however drawing the inevitable conclusions. The Marxians who, in
the beginning, wished to dissociate themselves definitely from the
policy of all parties looking to the pre-capitalist economic idea,
arrived in the end at exactly the same point of view.
The fight between Marxists and the parties calling themselves
emphatically anti-marxists is carried on by both sides with such a
vicllence of expression that one might easily be led into supposing
them irreconcilable. But this is by no means the case. Both parties,
Marxism and National-Socialism, agree in opposing Liberalism and
rejecting the capitalist social order. Both desire a socialist order of
society. The only difference in their programme lies in slight varia­
tions in their respective pictures of the future socialist State; non­
essential variations, as we could easily show. The foremost demands
of the national-socialist agitation are different from those of the
marxists. While the Marxists speak of abolishing the commodity
character of labour, the national socialists speak of breaking the
slavery of interest (Brechung der Zinsknechtschaft) . While the Marxists
hold the 'capitalists' responsible for every evil, the national-socialists
think to express themselves more concretely by shouting 'Death to
the Jews' (Juda verrecke) . 1
Marxism, National-Socialism, and other anti-capitalist parties
are indeed separated, not only by clique enmities, and personal
resentments, but also by problems of metaphysics and the con­
duct of life. But they all agree on the decisive problem of reshaping
the social order : they reject private ownership in the means of pro­
duction and desire a socialist order of society. It is true that the
paths by which they hope to reach the common goal run parallel
only for short stretches, but even where they diverge they remain
on adjacent territories.

It is not surprising that in spite of this close relationship they fight
out their feud with consuming bitterness. In a socialist community
the fate of the political minorities would necessarily become unbear­
able. How would national socialists fare under a bolshevist rule
or bolshevists under National Socialism?
The results of the destructionist policy are not affected by the
different slogans and banners employed. Whether the protagonists of
the 'right' or of the 'left' happen to be in power, 'to-morrow' is always
unhesitatingly sacrificed to 'to-day' . The supporters of the system
continue to feed it on capital - as long as crumb is left. 1

1 The best characterization of destructionism is in the words with which Stourm tried
to describe the financial policy of the Jacobins: ' L'esprit financier des jacobins consista
exc1usivement en ceci: epuiser a outrance le present, en sacrifiant I'avenir. Le lende­
main ne compta jamais pour eux: les affaires furent menees chaque jour comme s'il
s'agissait du dernier: tei rut ie caractere distinctif de tous ies actes de ia Revoiution.
Te1 est aussi le secret de son etonnante duree: la depredation quotidienne des reserves
accumuIees chez une nation riche et puissante fit surgir des ressources inattendues,
depassant toute prevision.' And it applies word for word to the German inflation
policy of 1923 when Stourm goes on: ' Les assignats, tant qu'ils valurent quelque chose,
si peu que ce fiJ.t, inonderent le pays en quantites sans cesse progressives. La per­
spective de la faillite n'arr�ta pas un seul in9tant les emissions. Elles ne cesserent que
sur le refus absolu du public d'accepter, meme a vii prix, n'importe quelle sorte de

§I
The 'interest' as an obstacle to destructionism
A CCORDlNG to Marx the political faith of the individual de­
fi pends upon the class to which he belongs; the political faith of
his class depends upon its interests as a class.

The bourgeoisie is

bound to support Capitalism. On the other hand the proletariat can
only achieve its purpose, can only free itself from capitalist exploita­
tion, by preparing the way for Socialism, Thus the respective positions
of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the political arena are
defined in advance. Perhaps no doctrine of Marx has made a deeper
or more lasting impression on political theory than this. It has found
acceptance far beyond the immediate range of Marxism. Liberalism
has come to be regarded as the doctrine in which the class interests
of the bourgeoisie and of big business find expression. Whoever pro­
fesses liberal opinions is considered to be a more or less well-meaning
representative of the special interests which stand in opposition to the
general good. Economists who reject the Marxian doctrine are
characterized as the 'spiritual bodyguard of the profits of capital ­
and sometimes also of ground-rents' 1
a remarkably convenient
theory which saves the Marxian the trouble of arguing with them.
Nothing indicates more clearly the widespread recognition which
has been accorded to this doctrine of Marx than its acceptance even
-

by the opponents of Socialism. When people suggest that the defeat

of socialist effort is a task chiefly or even exclusively for the pro­
pertied classes ; when they attempt to form a 'united front' of all the
bourgeois parties in order to oppose Socialism ; they then admit that
the maintenance of private property in the means of production

is

the special interest of a certain class, and that it is antagonistic to
the public welfare. These strangely short-sighted adversaries of
Socialism do not realize that any attempt on the part of a class,

500

'INTEREST' AS AN OBSTACLE

which is comparatively small when contrasted with the masses, to
defend its particular interests must be futile; they do not recognize
that private property is doomed when it is regarded as the privilege
of its owners. Still less are they able to perceive that their assumption
is radically contradicted by the experience of the formation of actual
political parties.
Liberalism is not a doctrine which serves the class interests of those
in possession of property. Whoever conceives it as such has already
admitted one of the leading contentions of Socialism; he is no liberal.
Liberalism upholds private property not in the interests of the owners,
but in the general interest; it believes that the maintenance of the
capitalist system is to the advantage not only of the capitalists but
of every member of society. It admits that in the socialist community
there will, in all probability, be little or no inequality of income.
But it urges that owing to the smaller yield of socialist production,
t.lte total amount to be shared will be considerably smaller, so that
each individual will receive less than the poorest receives to-day.
Whether this thesis is accepted or rejected is another question. This
is precisely the point upon which Socialism and Liberalism are in
conflict. Whoever rejects it out of hand, rejects Liberalism. Yet it
would be unreasonable to do this without careful consideration of
the problem and of the arguments of either sides.
In fact nothing is further from the particular interests of the entre­
preneurs, whether as individuals or as a class, than to defend the
principle of private property or to resist the principle of Socialism.
That the introduction of Socialism must necessarily injure the
entrepreneurs and capitalists, or at least their children, cannot be
disputed by those who believe that Socialism implies want and
distress for all. To this extent, therefore, the propertied classes are
admittedly concerned in resisting Socialism. But their interest is
no greater than that of any other member of society and is quite
independent of their privileged position. If it were possible to
imagine that Socialism would be introduced lock stock and barrel
overnight, then it might be said that the entrepreneurs and capitalists
had special reasons for wishing to maintain the capitalist system.
They would have more to lose. Even if the distress which resulted
from the reorganization were the same for all, those would suffer
more whose fall had been the greater. But it is not possible to
imagine that Socialism will be introduced so rapidly; and if it were,
501

OVERCOMING DESTRUCTIONISM
it may be assumed that the entrepreneurs, by reason of their expert
knowledge and ability to take responsibility, would occupy, at any
rate for a time, privileged positions within the socialist organization.
The entrepreneur is unable to provide for his grandchildren and
great-grandchildren. For it is characteristic of private property in
the means of production under the capitalist system that it creates
no permanent source of income. Every fortune must be renewed by
effort. When the feudal lord supported the feudal system he was
defending not only his own property but that of his descendants.
But the entrepreneur in the capitalist system knows that his children
and grandchildren will only survive in the face of new competition
if they can hold their ground as directors of productive enterprise.
If he is concerned for the fate of his successors and wants to consoli­
date his property for them in a way contrary to the interests of the
community, he will have to become an enemy of the capitalist social
order and demand every kind of restriction on competition. Even
the way to Socialism may strike him as the best means for this, pro­
vided the transition does not take place too suddenly, for he may
expect compensation against expropriation so that, for a longer or
shorter time, the expropriated will enjoy a secure income in place of
the uncertainty and insecurity that is the lot of owners of an enter­
prise. Consideration for his own property and for the property of
his successors may, therefore, urge the entrepreneurs rather to sup­
port than to oppose Socialism. He must welcome all efforts which
aim at suppressing newly created and newly developed fortunes,
especially all measures intended to limit anything in the nature of
economic freedom, because they make secure the income which
otherwise must be earned by daily struggle as long as competition is
not restricted - because they exclude new competitors. 1
Entrepreneurs have an interest in combining to proceed uni­
formly in wage negotiations with the workers organized in trade
unions. 2 And they have an interest in combining to carry through
tariff and other restrictions which conflict with the essence and
principle of Liberalism or to resist government interference which

AN

OBSTACLE

But they have absolutely no special interest in

fighting Socialism and socialization as such. They have no special
interest in fighting destructionism. The whole purpose of the entre­
preneur is to adjust himself to the economic contingencies of any
moment. His aim is not to fight Socialism, but to adjust himself to
conditions created by a policy directed towards socialization. It is
not to be expected that entrepreneurs or any other particular group
in the community should, out of self-interest, necessarily make the
general principles of well-being the maxim of their own procedure.
The necessities of life compel them to make the best of any given
circumstances. It is not the business of the entrepreneurs to lead the
political fight against Socialism; all that concerns them is to adjust
themselves and their enterprises to the situations created by the
measures directed towards socialization, so that they will make the
greatest profit possible under the conditions prevailing.
It follows therefore, that neither associations of entrepreneurs,
nor those organizations in which the entrepreneurs' support counts,
are inclined to fight on principle against Socialism. The entre­
preneur, the man who seizes the opportunity of the moment, has
little interest in the issue of a secular struggle of indefinite duration.
His interest is to adjust himself to the circumstances in which he finds
himself at the moment. An entrepreneurs' organization aims solely
at repulsing some individual encroachment of the trade unions ; or
it may oppose acts of legislation, such as special forms of taxation.
It carries out the tasks assigned to it by parliaments and govern­
ments in cases where it is desired that the organized body of entre­
preneurs should co-operate with the organized working class in
order to give the destructionist element its say in the national
economy. To fight on principle for the maintenance of an economy
based on private property in the means of production is no part of
the programme of organized entrepreneurs. Its attitude towards
Liberalism is one of indifference or even, as in the case of tariff
policy, of antagonism.
Organized interests, as the socialist doctrine depicts them, corre­
spond not to the entrepreneurs' associations but to the farmers'
unions, which advocate tariff duties on agricultural products, or
those associations of small producers, which - above all in Austria press for the exclusion of competition. These clearly are not efforts
on behalf of Liberalism.

OVERCOMING DESTRUCTIONISM
Thus there are no individuals and no classes whose particular
interests would lead them to support Capitalism as such. The policy
of Liberalism is the policy of the common good, the policy of sub­
jecting particular interests to the public welfare - a process that
demands from the individual not so much a renunciation of his own
interests as a perception of the harmony of all individual interests.
There are, therefore, no individuals and no groups whose interests
would ultimately be better guarded by Socialism than by a society
based on private ownership in the means of production. But although
ultimately no one's interests would actually be better served by
Socialism, there are plenty of people whose particular interests of
the moment are better guarded by a policy directed towards
socialization than by the maintenance of Liberalism. Liberalism has
opposed everything in the nature of a sinecure and has sought to
reduce to a minimum the number of public officials. The inter­
ventionist policy provides thousands and thousands of peopie with
safe, placid, and not too strenuous jobs at the expense of the rest of
society. All nationalization or setting up of a municipal or public
enterprise links private interests with the movement against private
property. To-day Socialism and destructionism find their strongest
supporters in the millions for whom a return to a freer economy
would be at first and in the short run detrimental to their particular
interests.

§2
Violence and authori�
The attitude of mind which sees in private property a privilege
of the owners is an echo from former periods in the history of pro­
perty. All property ownership began with appropriation of owner­
less things. The history of property passed through a period in
which forcible dispossession of the owners was the rule. It is safe to
say that the ownership of any piece of ground property can be
traced back to seizure by violence. This has of course no application
to the sociai order of Capitalism, as property here is constantly being
acquired in the process of market competition. But as the liberal
principles have nowhere - in Europe at least - been put into
practice in their entirety, and as everywhere, especially in landed

property, very much of the old taint of violence survives, the tradi­
tion of the feudal owners

is

still upheld :

'/ch lieg und besit;;;e.'

Criticism of property rights is met with violent abuse. This is
the policy the German j unkers adopted against Social Democracy ­
with what success is well known. 1
Partisans of this order can say nothing in justification of private
ownership in the means of production but that it is upheld by
force. The right of the strong is the only right they can enforce. They
boast of their physical force, rely on their armed equipment, and
consider the�selves entitled to despise any other argument. Only
when the ground begins to tremble under their feet, do they produce
another argument by taking their stand upon acquired rights.
Violation of their property becomes an illegality which must be
avoided. We need waste no words in exposing the weakness of this
point of view in the struggle against a movement that wants to found

opinion has condemned property. Its beneficiaries recognize this
with horror and turn in their distress to the Church, with the odd
request that the Church shall keep the misera plebs modest and
humble, fight covetousness and turn the eyes of the propertyless from
earthly goods to heavenly things. · Christianity is to be kept alive so
that the people shall not become covetous. But the demand thus
made to the Church is monstrous. It is asked to serve the interests,
generally assumed to be harmful to the community, of a number of
privileged persons. It is obvious that the true servants of the Church
have revolted against this presumptuous demand, while enemies of
the Church have found it an effective weapon in their war of libera­
tion against religion. What is surprising is that ecclesiastical enemies
of Socialism, in their efforts to represent Socialism as a child of
Liberalism, of the free school, and of atheism, have taken up just
the same attitude towards the work which the Church performs in
maintaining existing property relations. Thus the Jesuit Cathrein
says: 'If one assumes that with this life all is finished, that to man is

over the means of production, but rather with maintaining it as title to a special source
of income. Therefore State Socialism has easily won him over. It is to secure him his

the mire, who then will ask of the poor and oppressed, whose life
is a constant struggle for existence, that they should bear their hard
fate with patience and resignation, and look on while others clothe
themselves in silk and purple and have regular and ample meals?
Does not the worker too carry in his heart the indestructible impulse
towards perfect happiness? If he is robbed of every hope of a better
world beyond, by what right is he prevented from seeking his
happiness as far as possible on earth and so demanding imperatively,
his share of the earth's riches? Is he not just as much man as his
employer? Why should some just manage to exist in want and
poverty while others live on the fat of the land, when from their
point of view there is no reason why the good things of this world
should belong to some rather than to others? If the atheistic­
naturalistic standpoint is justified, so also is the Socialist demand:
that worldly goods and happiness should be distributed to all as
equaHy as possibie, that it is wrong for some to live a Hfe of idie
enjoyment in palaces while others live in miserable cellars and attics,
barely able in spite of the most strenuous efforts to earn their daily
bread. ' 1 Assuming matters to be just as Cathrein imagines them ­
that private property is a privilege of the owners, that the others are
poorer in proportion as these are rich, that some starve because others
carouse, that some live in miserable little rooms because others live

in lordly places - does he really believe that it could possibly be a
work of the Church to maintain such conditions? Whatever one may
read into the Church's social teaching, one cannot suppose that its
founder or his supporters would have approved of its being used to
bolster up unjust social institutions that are obviously disadvantageous
to the greater part of humanity. Christianity would long since have
vanished from the earth, were it that for which, in common with
many of its bitterest enemies, Bismarck and Cathrein mistook it : a
bodyguard for a social institution injurious to the masses.

The socialist idea can be suppressed neither by force nor by
authority, for both are on the side of Socialism and not of its
opponents. If guns and machine-guns are brought into action to-day
they will be in the ranks of Socialism and Syndicalism, and not
opposed to them. For the great mass of our contemporaries are
imbued with the spirit of Socialism or of Syndicalism. Whatever

system is set in authority at the present time, it can certainly not be
Capitalism, for the masses do not believe in it.

§3
The battle of ideas
It is a mistake to think that the lack of success of experiments in
Socialism that have been made can help to overcome Socialism.
Facts

per se

can neither prove nor refute anything.

Everything is

decided by the interpretation and explanation of the facts, by the
ideas and the theories.
The man who clings to Socialism will continue to ascribe all the
world's evil to private property and to expect salvation from
Socialism. Socialists ascribe the failures of Russian Bolshevism to
every circumstance except the inadequacy of the system. From the
socialist point of view, Capitalism alone is responsible for all the
misery the world has had to endure in recent years. Socialists see
only what they want to see and are blind to anything that might
contradict their theory.
Only ideas can overcome ideas and it is only the ideas of Capitalism
and of Liberalism that can overcome Socialism. Only by a battle of
ideas can a decision be reached.
Liberalism and Capitalism address themselves to the cool, well­
balanced mind. They proceed by strict logic, eliminating any appeal
to the emotions. Socialism, on the contrary, works on the emotions,
tries to violate logical considerations by rousing a sense of personal
interest and to stifle the voice of reason by awakening primitive
instincts.
Even with those of intellectually higher standing, with the few
capable of independent reflection, this seems to give Socialism an
advantage. With the others, the great masses who are unable to
think, the Socialist position is considered unshakable. A speaker who
inflames the passions of the masses is supposed to have a better chance
of success than one who appeals to their reason. Thus the prospects ef
Liberalism in the fight with Socialism are accounted very poor.
This pessimistic point of view is completely mistaken in its
estimate of the influence which rational and quiet reflection
can exercise on the masses. It also exaggerates enormously the

507

OVER C O MI N G D E ST R U CT ION ISM
importance of the part played by the masses, and consequently
mass-psychological elements, in creating and forming the pre­
dominant ideas of an epoch.
It is true that the masses do not think. But just for this reason
they follow those who do think. The intellectual guidance of
humanity belongs to the very few who think for themselves. At first
they influence the circle of those capable of grasping and under­
standing what others have thought; through these intermediaries
their ideas reach the masses and there condense themselves into the
public opinion of the time. Socialism has not become the ruling idea
of our period because the masses first thought out the idea of the
socialization of the means of production and then transmitted it to
the intellectually higher classes. Even the materialistic conception of
history, haunted as it is by 'the psyche ofthe people' as conceived by
Romanticism and the historical school of jurisprudence does not
risk such an assertion. Of itself the mass psyche has never produced
anything but mass crime, devastation, and destruction. 1 Admittedly
the idea of Socialism is also in its effects nothing more than destruc­
tion, but it is nevertheless an idea. It had to be thought out, and this
could only be the work of individual thinkers. Like every other great
thought, it has penetrated to the masses only through the intellectual
middle class. Neither the people nor the masses were the first
socialists. Even to-day they are agrarian socialist and syndicalist
rather than socialist. The first socialists were the intellectuals; they
and not the masses are the backbone of Socialism. · The power of
Socialism too, is like any other power ultimately spiritual; and it finds
its support in ideas proceeding from the intellectual leaders, who give
them to the people. If the intelligentsia abandoned Socialism its
power would end. In the long run the masses cannot withstand the
ideas of the leaders. True, individual demagogues may be ready, for
the sake of a career and against their better knowledge, to instil into
the people ideas which flatter their baser instincts and which are
therefore sure to be well received. But in the end, prophets who in
their heart know themselves to be false cannot prevail against those
filled with the power of sincere conviction. Nothing can corrupt
Maciver, Community, London [924, p. 79 et seq.
This, of course, is true also of the German nation. Almost the whole intelligentsia
of Germany is socialistic: in national circles it is State or, as one usually says to-day,
National Socialism, in Catholic circles, Church Socialism, in other circles, Social­
Democracy or Bolshevism.

ideas. Neither by money nor by other rewards can one hire men for
the fight against ideas.
Human society is an issue of the mind. Social co-operation must
first be conceived, then willed, then realized in action. It is ideas
that make history, not the 'material productive forces', those
nebulous and mystical schemata of the materialist conception of
history. Ifwe could overcome the idea of Socialism, if humanity could
be brought to recognize the social necessity of private ownership in
the means of production, then Socialism would have to leave the
stage. That is the orrly thing that counts.
The victory of the socialist idea over the Liberal idea has only
come about through the displacement of the social attitude, which
has regard to the social function of the single institution and the total
effect of the whole social apparatus, by an anti-social attitude, which
considers the individual parts of the social mechanism as detached
units. Socialism sees the individuals - the hungry, the unemployed,
and the rich - and criticizes captiously; Liberalism never forgets the
whole and the interdependence of every phenomenon. It knows well
enough that private ownership in the means of production is not
able to transform the world into a paradise; it has never tried to
establish anything beyond the simple fact that the socialist order of
society is unrealizable, and therefore less able than Capitalism to
promote the well-being of all.
No one has understood Liberalism less than those who have
joined its ranks during the recent decades. They have felt themselves
obliged to fight 'excrescences' of Capitalism, thereby taking over
without a qualm the characteristic anti-social attitude of the socialists.
A social order has no excrescences which can be cut off at will. If a
phenomenon results inevitably from a social system based on private
ownership in the means of production, no ethical or aesthetic
caprice can condemn it. Speculation, for example, which is in­
herent in all economic action, in a socialistic society as well as any
other, cannot be condemned for the form it takes under Capitalism
merely because the censor of morals mistakes its social function.

their criticisms of Socialism. They have constantly declared that
Socialism is a beautiful and noble ideal towards which one ought to
strive were it realizable, but that, alas, it could not be so, because it
presupposed human beings more perfect morally than those with
509

O V E R CO M I N G DE S T R U CT I ON I S M
whom we have to deal. It is difficult to see how people can decide
that Socialism is in any way better than Capitalism unless they can
maintain that it functions better as a social system. With the same
j ustification it might be said that a machine constructed on the basis
of perpetual motion would be better than one worked according to
the given laws of mechanics - if only it could be made to function
reliably. !fthe concept of Socialism contains an error which prevents
that system from doing what it is supposed to do, then Socialism can­
not be compared with the Capitalist system, for this has proved itself
workable. Neither can it be called nobler, more beautiful or more
just.
It is true, Socialism cannot be realized, but it is not because it
calls for sublime and altruistic beings. One of the things this book
set out to prove was that the socialist commonwealth lacks above all
one q uality which is indispensable for every economic system which
does not iive from hand to mouth but works with fndirect and
roundabout methods of production : that is the ability to calculate,
and therefore to proceed rationally. Once this has been generally
recognized, all socialist ideas must vanish from the minds of reason­
able human beings.
How untenable is the opinion that Socialism must come because
social evolution necessarily leads to it, has been shown in earlier
sections of this book. The world inclines to Socialism because the
great majority of people want it. They want it because they believe
that Socialism will guarantee a higher standard of welfare. The loss
of this conviction would signify the end of Socialism.

Socialism in history

OTHING is more difficult than to get a clear, historical perspec­
N tive of a contemporary movement. The proximity of the
phenomenon makes it difficult to recognize

the whole in true

proportion. Historical judgment above all demands distance.
Wherever Europeans or the descendants of European emigrants
live, we see Socialism at work to-day; and in Asia it is the banner
round which the antagonists of European civilization gather. If
the intellectual dominance of Socialism remains unshaken, then in a
short time the whole co-operative system of culture which Europe
has built up during thousands of years will be shattered. For a
socialist order of society is unrealizable. All efforts to realize
Socialism lead only to the destruction of society. Factories, mines,
and railways will come to a standstill, towns will be deserted. The
population of the industrial territories will die out or migrate else­
where. The farmer will return to the self-sufficiency of the closed,
domestic economy. Without private ownership in the means of
production there is, in the long run, no production other than a
hand-to-mouth production for one's own needs.
We need not describe in detail the cultural and political conse­
quences of such a transformation. Nomad tribes from the Eastern
steppes would again raid and pillage Europe, sweeping across it
with swift cavalry. Who could resist them in the thinly populated
land left defenceless after the weapons inherited from the higher
technique of Capitalism had worn out?
This is one possibility. But there are others. It might so
happen that some nations would remain socialistic while others
returned to Capitalism. Then the socialist countries alone would
proceed towards social decline. The capitalist countries would
progress to a higher development of the division of labour until at
51 1

CONCLUSION
last, driven by the fundamental social law to draw the greatest
number of human beings into the personal division of labour, and
the whole earth's surface into the geographical division of labour,
they would impose culture upon the backward nations or destroy
them if they resisted. This has always been the historical fate of
nations who have eschewed the road of capitalist development or who
have halted prematurely upon it.
lt may be that we exaggerate enormously the importance of the
present-day socialist movement. Perhaps it has no more significance
than the outbreaks against private property in the medieval
persecution of the Jews, in the Franciscan movement, or in the
Reformation period. And the Bolshevism of Lenin and Trotsky is
possibly no more important than Knipperdolling's and Bockelson's
anabaptist rule in MUnster; it is no greater in proportion to the
latter than is modern Capitalism in proportion to the Capitalism of
the sixteenth century. Just as civilization overcame those attacks so
it may emerge stronger and purer from the upheavals of our time.

§2
The crisis of civilization
Society is a product of will and action. Only human beings are
able to will and act. All the mysticism and symbolism of collectivist
philosophy cannot help us over the fact that we can speak only
figuratively of the thinking, willing, and acting of communities, and
that the conception of sentient thinking, willing, and acting com­
munities is merely anthropomorphism. Society and the individual
postulate each other; those collective bodies, which collectivism
assumes to have existed logically and historically before individuals,
may have been herds and hordes, but they were in no way societies that is, associations created and existing by means of the collabora­
tion of thinking creatures. Human beings construct society by
making their actions a mutually conditioned co-operation.
The basis and starting point of social co-operation lie in peace­
making, which consists in the mutual recognition of the 'state of
property'. Out of a de facto having, maintained by force, arises the
legal concept of ownership, and simultaneously, the legal order and
the coercive apparatus to maintain it. All this is the result of
512

CONCLUSION

conscious willing and awareness of the aims willed. But this willing
sees and wills only the most immediate and direct result: of the
remoter consequences it knows nothing and can know nothing. Men
who create peace and standards of conduct are only concerned to
provide for the needs of the coming hours, days, years; that they are,
at the same time, working to build a great structure like human
society, escapes their notice. Therefore the individual institutions,
which collectively support the social organism, are created with no
other view in mind than the utility of the moment. They seem
individually necessary and useful to their creators; their social
function remains unknown to them.
The human mind ripens slowly to the recognition of social
interdependence. At first, society is so mysterious and incompre­
hensible a formation to man that, to grasp its origin and nature, he
continues to assume a divine will guiding human destinies from
outside iong after he has renounced this concept in the natural
sciences. Kant's Nature, which leads humanity towards a special
aim, Hegel's World Spirit, and the Darwinian Natural Selection
are the last great expressions of this method. It remained for the
liberal social philosophy to explain society through the actions of
mankind without having to draw on metaphysics. It alone succeeds
in interpreting the social function of private property. It is not
content to accept the Just as a given category which cannot be
analysed, or to account for it by an inexplicable predilection for
just conduct. It bases its conclusions on the considerations of the
consequences of acts and from a valuation of these consequences.
Judged from the old standpoint, property was sacred. Liberalism
destroyed this nimbus, as it destroys all others. It 'debased' property
into a utilitarian, worldly matter. Property no longer has absolute
value; it is valued as a means, that is, for its utility. In philosophy
such a change of views involves no special difficulties; an inadequate
doctrine is replaced by one more adequate. But a fundamental
revolution of the mind cannot be carried out in life and in the
consciousness of the masses with the same lack of friction. It is no
trifle when an idol before which humanity has trembled and feared
for thousands of years is destroyed and the frightened slave gets his
freedom. That which was law because God and conscience so
ordained, is now to be law because one can oneself make it so at
will. What was certain becomes uncertain; right and wrong, good
513

CONCLUSION
and evil, all these conceptions begin to totter. The old tables of the
law are shattered and man is left to make new commandments for
himself. This cannot be achieved by means of parliamentary debate
or in peaceful voting. A revision of the moral code can only be
carried through when minds are deeply stirred and passions
unloosed. To recognize the social utility of private property one
must first be convinced of the perniciousness of every other system.
That this is the substance of the great fight between Capitalism
and Socialism becomes evident when we realize that the same process
is taking place in other spheres of moral life. The problem ofproperty
is not the only one which is being discussed to-day. It is the same
with the problem of bloodshed which, in its many aspects - and
particularly in connection with war and peace - agitates the whole
world. In sexual morality, too, age-old moral precepts are under­
going transformation. Things which were held to be taboo, rules
which have been obeyed for moral and almost sacred reasons, are now
prescribed or prohibited according to the importance attached to
them in respect of the promotion of public welfare. This revaluation
of the grounds on which precepts of conduct have been based has
inevitably caused a general revision of standards which have been
in force up till now. Men ask : are they really useful or might they
not really be abolished?
In the inner life of the individual the fact that the moral equi­
librium has not yet been reached causes grave psychological shocks,
well known to medicine as neuroses. 1 This is the characteristic
malady of our time of moral transition, of the spiritual adolescence of
the nations. In social life the discord works iself out in conflicts and
errors which we witness with horror. Just as it is decisively important
in the life of the individual man whether he emerges safe and sound
from the troubles and fears of adolescence or whether he carries
away scars which hinder him permanently from developing his
abilities, so is it important in what manner human society will
struggle through the vexed problems of organization. A rise to a
closer interdependence of individuals and hence to a higher well­
being, on the one hand; a decay of co-operation and hence of
wealth, on the other: these are the choice before us. There is no
third alternative.
The great social discussion cannot proceed otherwise than by
1

means of the thought, will, and action of individuals. Society lives
and acts only in individuals; it is nothing more than a certain attitude

on their part. Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders;
no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one
can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping towards
destruction. Therefore everyone, in his own interests, must thrust
himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside
with unconcern; the interests of everyone hang on the result.

Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great
historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has
plunged us.

Neither God nor a mystical 'Natural Force' created society; it
was created by mankind. Whether society shall continue to evolve or
whether it shall decay lies - in the sense in which causal determina­
tion of all events permits us to speak of freewill - in the hand of
man. Whether Society is good or bad may be a matter of individual
judgment; but whoever prefers life to death, happiness to suffering,
well-being to misery, must accept society. And whoever desires that
society should exist and develop must also accept, without limitation
or reserve, private ownership in the means of production.

APPEND I X

A contribution to the critique of attempts to construct a vstem of economic
calculation for the Socialist community

E may divide the various attempts, which have been made to
Wthink out a system of economic calculation which would work
In so doing we leave
under Socialism, into two main groups.
out of count works based on the labour theory of value which are

misleading from the very outset. The first would contain those which
may be designated syndicalist constructions, the second those which
try to evade the impossibility of solving the problem by assuming
that economic data do not change.

The error in both groups of

proposals should be clear from what we have said above (pp. 1 1 3-150) .
The following criticism, which I have made of two typical con­
structions of this kind, is intended to add further elucidations. 1
In an article entitled 'Sozialistische Rechnungslegung' [Socialist
Accounting] I Karl Polanyi has attempted to solve what he calls
'the problem of socialist accounting' which is, according to him,
'generally recognized to be the key problem of the socialist economy' .
Polanyi first admits unreservedly that he considers the solution of the
problem impossible 'in a central administrative economy'. 8 His
attempt to solve the problem is designed only for 'a functionally
organized socialist transition-economy' . This is the name he gives
to a type of society corresponding approximately to the ideal of the
English Guild Socialists. But his concept of the nature and possi­
bilities of his system is, unfortunately, no less nebulous and vague
than that of the Guild Socialists themselves . The political com­
munity 'is considered to be " the owner of the means of production" ;
but no direct right of disposing of production is implied by this
ownership' . This right belongs to associations of producers, elected
by workers in the various branches of production. The several
individual producers' associations are to be amalgamated as the
Congress of producers' associations, which 'represents the whole of
production'. Confronting this is the 'Commune', as the second
1 ArchivJiir SozialwissenschaJt, Vol. LI, pp. 490-95.

3 Ibid., pp. 378 and 419.

5 16

APPENDIX
'functional main association of society' . The Commune is not only
the political organ, hut also the 'real bearer of the community's
higher aims'. Each of these two functional associations exercise
'within its own sphere the legislative and executive functions'.
Agreements between these functional main associations constitute
the highest power in society. 1
Now the defect in this system is the obscurity in which it evades
the central problem - Socialism or Syndicalism ? With the Guild­
Socialists, Polanyi expressly assigns to society, to the Commune,
ownership of the means of production. In doing so he seems to think
he has said enough to save his system from the charge of Syndicalism.
But in the next sentence he withdraws what he has said. Ownership
is the right of disposal. If the right of disposal belongs not to the
Commune, but to the producers' association, these are the owners,
and we have before us a syndicalist community. One or the other it
must be; between Syndicalism and Socialism there can be no com­
promise or reconciliation. Polanyi does not see this. He says :
'Functional representatives (associations) of one and the same person
can never irreconcilably conflict with each other; this is the funda­
mental idea of every functional constitution. For the settlement of
each conflict, as it arises, either joint committees of the Commune
and the Producers' Association are provided or a kind of Supreme
Constitutional Court (co-ordinating organs ) , which has, however,
no legislative power and only limited executive power (guarding law
and order, etc. ) . ' I This fundamental idea of the functional form of
constitution is, however, wrong. If the political parliament is to be
formed by the votes of all citizens, with equal voting rights for each ­
and this condition is implied by Polanyi and all other similar systems ­
then the parliament and the congress of producers' associations,
which is the result of an electoral structure quite differently built up,
may, easily, conflict. These conflicts cannot be settled by joint
committees or by law courts. The committees can settle the quarrel
only if one or other of the main associations preponderates within
them. If both are equally strong, the committee can come to no
decision. If one of the two associations preponderates the ultimate
decision lies with it. A law court cannot settle questions of political
or economic practice. Law courts can give judgment only on the

basis of already existing norms, which they apply to individual
cases. If they are to deal with questions of utility, then they are in
reality not law courts but supreme political authorities, and every­
thing we have said about the committees is true of them.
If the final decision rests with neither the Commune nor the
Congress of Producers' Associations, the system cannot live at all.
If ultimate decision lies with the Commune, we have to deal with a
'central administrative economy', and this, as even Polanyi admits,
could not calculate economically. If the Producers' Associations
decide, then we have a syndicalist community.
Polanyi's obscurity on this fundamental point allows him to
accept a merely apparent solution as an actual workable solution of
the problem. His associations and sub-associations maintain a
mutual exchange-relationship; they receive and give as if they were
owners. Thus a market and market-prices are formed. But because
he thinks he has surmounted the unbridgeable gulf between Socialism
and Syndicalism, Polanyi does not perceive that this is incompatible
with Socialism. We might say much more about other errors in the
details of Polanyi's system. But in view of his fundamental mistake
they are of litle interest, as they are peculiar to Polanyi's train of
thought. That fundamental mistake is, however, no peculiarity of
Polanyi's; all guild socialist systems share it. Polanyi has the merit
of having worked out this system more clearly than most other
writers. He has thus exposed its weakness more clearly. He must also
be given due credit for having realized that economic calculation
would be impossible in a centralized administrative economy with
no markets.
Another contribution to our problem comes from Eduard
Heimann. Heimann is a believer in an ethical or religious Socialism.
But his political views do not blind him to the problem of economic
calculation. In treating this, he follows the arguments of Max
Weber. Max Weber had seen that this was the 'absolutely central'
problem for Socialism, and had shown in a detailed discussion, in
which he rejected Qtto Neurath's pet dreams of 'calculation in
kind' ('Naturalrechnung') that rational economic action was
impossible without money and money-accounting. Heimann there1

fore tries to prove that one could calculate in a socialist economy.
Whilst Polanyi proceeds from a system allied to the English
guild socialists, Heimann develops proposals parallel to the German
ideas for a planned economy. It is characteristic that the arguments,
nevertheless, resemble PoHmyi's on the only point that matters : they
are regrettably vague just where they ought to be explicit about the
relationship between the individual productive groups, into which
the society organized according to planned economy is to be divided,
and society as a whole. Thus he is able to speak of trade taking
place as in a market, l without noticing that the planned economy,
completely and logically carried through, is tradeless and that what
might be called buying and selling should, according to its nature, be
described quite otherwise. Heimann makes this mistake because he
thinks that the characteristic mark of the planned economy is above
all the monopolistic amalgamation of individual branches of pro­
duction, instead of the dependance of production on the unitary
will of a central organ. This mistake is all the more astonishing as
the very name 'planned economy' and all the arguments brought
forward to support it stress particularly that the economic direction
would be unitary. Heimann does indeed see the hollowness of the
propaganda which works with the catchword 'anarchy of produc­
tion' . I But this ought never to have allowed him to forget that just
this point and nothing else, is what sharply divides Socialism
from Capitalism.
Like most writers who have dealt with the planned economy,
Heimann does not notice that a planned economy logically carried
out is nothing more than pure Socialism and differs from the strictly
centrally organized socialist community only in externals. That
under the unitary direction of the central authority the administra­
tion of individual branches of production is entrusted to seemingly
independent departments does not alter the fact that only the central
authority directs. The relations between the individual departments
are settled, not on the market by the competition of buyers and
sellers, but by the command of authority. The problem is this : that
there is no standard by which one may account and calculate the
effects of these authoritarian interventions, because the central
authority cannot be guided by exchange-relationships formed on a

market. The authority may indeed base its calculations on substi­
tution-relations, which it determines itself. But this decision is
arbitrary; it is not based, as are market prices, on the subjective
valuations of individuals and imputed to the producers' goods by
the co-operation of all those active in production and trade. Rational
economic calculation cannot therefore be based upon it.
Heimann achieves an apparent solution of the problem by
invoking the theory of costs. Economic calculation is to be based
upon cost computations, prices are to be calculated on the basis of
the average costs of production, including wages, of the works
attached to the accounting-office. 1 This is a solution which might
have satisfied us two or three generations ago. It is not enough
nowadays. If by costs we mean the loss of utility which a different
use of the factors of production could have avoided, it is easy to see
that Heimann is moving in a circle.

In the socialist community

only an order from the centrai authority couid enabie industry to
use the factors of production elsewhere, and the problem is just
whether this authority could calculate so as to decide upon such an
order. The competition of entrepreneurs who, in a social order
based on private property, try to use goods and services most
profitably, is replaced in the planned economy - as in every imagin­
able form of socialist society - by actions-according-to-plan of the
supreme authority. Now it is only by this competition Letween
entrepreneurs, trying to wrest from each other the material means of
production and the services of labour, that the prices of the factors
of production are formed. Where production is to be carried on
'according to plan', that is, by a central authority to whom every­
thing is subject, the basis of calculation of profitability vanishes; only
accounting in kind remains. Heimann says : 'As soon as real compe­
tition exists on the market for consumers' goods, the price-relation­
ships thus determined spread from there through all the stages of
production, provided that pricing is effected reasonably; and this
happens independently of the constitution of the parties in the
markets for producers' goods. 2 This, however, would only be the
case if there were genuine competition. Heimann conceives society
to be the association of a number of 'monopo!ists', that is, of depart­

ments of the socialist community, to each of which is entrusted the

exclusive working of a delimited field of production.

If

these

buy

producers' goods on the 'market', it is not competition, . because the
central authority has in advance assigned to them the field in which
they are to be active and which they must not leave. Competition
exists only when everyone produces what seems to promise the best
profit. I have tried to show that this can only be ensured by private
ownership in the means of production.
Heimann's picture of the socialist community considers only the
current transformation of raw materials into consumers' goods; it
thus creates the impression that the individual departments could
proceed independently. Far more important than this part of the
productive process is the renewal of capital and the investment of
newly-formed capital. This is the central problem of economic
calculation, not the problem of disposing of the circulating capital

already in existence. One cannot base decisions of this sort, which
are binding for years and decades ahead, on the momentary demand
for consumers' goods. One must look to the future, that is, one must
be 'speculative'. Heimann's scheme, which enlarges or restricts
production mechanically and automatically, so to speak, according
to the present demand for consumers' goods, fails here entirely. For
to solve the problem of value by going back to costs would suffice
only for a theoretically conceivable state of equilibrium, imagina­
tively conceivable but empirically non-existent. Only in such an
imaginary state of equilibrium do price and costs coincide, not in
a changing economy.
For this reason, in my judgment, Heimann's attempt to solve the
problem, which I submit I have shown to be unsolvable, breaks
down.

REMARKS

HE

characteristic mark of this age of dictators, wars and revolu­
tions is its anti-capitalistic bias. Most governments and political
parties are eager to restrict the sphere of private initiative and free
enterprise. It is an almost unchallenged dogma that capitalism is
done for and that the coming of all-round regimentation of economic

T

activities is both inescapable and highly desirable.
None the less capitalism is still very vigorous in the Western Hemi­
sphere. Capitalist production has made very remarkable progress even
in these last years. Methods of production were greatly improved.
Consumers have been supplied with better and cheaper goods and
with many new articles unheard of a short time ago. Many countries
have expanded the size and improved the quality of their manu­
facturing. In spite of the anti-capitalistic policies of all governments
and of almost all political parties, the capitalist mode of production
is in many countries still fulfilling its social function in supplying the
consumers with more, better and cheaper goods.
It is certainly not a merit of governments, politicians and labour
union officers that the standard of living is improving in the countries
committed to the principle of private ownership of the means of
production. Not offices and bureaucrats, but big business deserves
credit for the fact that most of the families in the United States own
a motor car and a radio set. The increase in per capita consumption
in America as compared with conditions a quarter of a century ago
is not an achievement of laws and executive orders. It is an accom­
plishment of business men who enlarged the size of their factories or
built new ones.
One must stress this point because our contemporaries are inclined
to ignore it. Entangled in the superstitions of stateism and govern­
ment omnipotence, they are exclusively preoccupied with govern­
mental measures. They expect everything from authoritarian action
and very little from the initiative of enterprising citizens.

Yet, the

only means to increase well-being is to increase the quantity of
products. This is what business aims at.
It is grotesque that there is much more talk about the achieve­
ments of the Tennessee Valley Authority than about all the un-

precedented and unparalleled achievements of American privately
operated processing industries. However, it was only the latter
which enabled the United Nations to win the war and today enable
the United States to come to the aid of the Marshall Plan countries.
The dogma that the State or the Government is the embodiment
of all that is good and beneficial and that the individuals are
wretched underlings, exclusively intent upon inflicting harm upon
one another and badly in need of a guardian, is almost unchallenged.
It is taboo to question it in the slightest way. He who proclaims the
godliness of the State and the infallibility of its priests, the bureau­
crats, is considered as an impartial student of the social sciences.
All those raising objections are branded as biased and narrow­
minded. The supporters of the new religion of statolatry are no less
fanatical and intolerant than were the Mohammedan conquerors of
.Africa and Spain.
History will call our age the age of the dictators and tyrants. We
have witnessed in the last years the fall of two of these inflated super­
men. But the spirit which raised these knaves to autocratic power
survives. It permeates textbooks and periodicals, it speaks through
the mouths of teachers and politicians, it manifests itself in party
programmes and in plays and novels. As long as this spirit prevails
there cannot be any hope of durable peace, of democracy, of the
preservation of freedom or of a steady improvement in the nation's
economic well-being.

EPILOGUE

The Failure of Interventionism

OTHING is more unpopular today than the free market economy,
Ni.e., capitalism. Everything that is considered unsatisfactory in
present-day conditions is charged to capitalism. The atheists make
capitalism responsible for the survival of Christianity. But the papal
encyclicals blame capitalism for the spread of irreligion and the sins
of our contemporaries, and the Protestant churches and sects are no
less vigorous in their indictment of capitalist greed. Friends of peace
consider our wars as an offshoot of capitaiist imperiaiism. But the
adamant nationalist warmongers of Germany and Italy indicted
capitalism for its 'bourgeois' pacifism, contrary to human nature
and to the inescapable laws of history. Sermonizers accuse capitalism
of disrupting the family and fostering licentiousness. But the 'pro­
gressives' blame capitalism for the preservation of allegedly out­
dated rules of sexual restraint. Almost all men agree that poverty is
an outcome of capitalism. On the other hand many deplore the fact
that capitalism, in catering lavishly to the wishes of people intent upon
getting more amenities and a better living, promotes a crass material­
ism. These contradictory accusations of capitalism cancel one
another. But the fact remains that there are few people left who
would not condemn capitalism altogether.
Although capitalism is the economic system of modern Western
civilization, the policies of all Western nations are guided by utterly
anti-capitalistic ideas. The aim of these interventionist policies is
not to preserve capitalism, but to substitute a mixed economy for it.
It is assumed that this mixed economy is neither capitalism nor
socialism. It is described as a third system, as far from capitalism
as it is from socialism. It is alleged that it stands midway between
socialism and capitaiism, retaining the advantages of both and
avoiding the disadvantages inherent in each.
More than half a century ago the outstanding man in the British
socialist movement, Sidney Webb, declared that the socialist philo52 7

EPILOGUE
sophy is 'but the conscious and explicit assertion of principles of social
organization which have been already in great part unconsciously
adopted' . And he added that the economic history of the nineteenth
century was 'an almost continuous record of the progress of social­
ism' . l A few years later an eminent British statesman, Sir William
Harcourt, stated : 'We are all socialists now.'2 When in 1 9 1 3 an
American, Elmer Roberts, published a book on the economic policies
of the Imperial Government of Germany as conducted since the end
of the seventies, he called them 'monarchical socialism'. 8
However, it was not correct simply to identify interventionism and
socialism. There are many supporters of interventionism who con­
sider it the most appropriate method of realizing - step by step full socialism. But there are also many interventionists who are not
outright socialists ; they aim at the establishment of the mixed
economy as a permanent system of economic management. They
endeavour to restrain, to regulate and to 'improve' capitalism by
government interference with business and by labour unionism.
In order to comprehend the working of interventionism and of the
mixed economy it is necessary to clarify two points :
First : If within a society based on private ownership of the means
of production some of these means are owned and operated by the
government or by municipalities, this still does not make for a mixed
system which would combine socialism and private ownership. As
long as only certain individual enterprises are publicly controlled,

the characteristics of the market economy determining economic

activity remain essentially unimpaired. The publicly owned enter­
prises, too, as buyers of raw materials, semi-finished goods and
labour, and as sellers of goods and services, must fit into the mechan­
ism of the market economy. They are subject to the law of the
market; they have to strive after profits or, at least, to avoid losses.
When it is attempted to mitigate or to eliminate this dependence by
covering the losses of such enterprises with subsidies out of public
funds, the only result is a shifting of this dependence somewhere
else. This is because the means for the subsidies have to be raised
somewhere. They may be raisp.d by collecting taxes. But the burden
of such taxes has its effects on the public, not on the government

collecting the tax. I t is the market, and not the revenue department,
which decides upon whom the burden of the tax falls and how it
affects production and consumption. The market and its inescapable
law are supreme.
Second : There are two different patterns for the realization of
socialism. The one pattern - we may call it the Marxian or Russian
pattern - is purely bureaucratic.

All economic

enterprises

are

departments of the government just as the administration of the
army and the navy or the postal system. Every single plant, shop
or farm, stands in the same relation to the superior central organiza­
tion as does a post office to the office of the Postmaster-General. The
whole nation forms one single labour army with compulsory service ;
the commander of this army i s the chief of state.
The second pattern - we may call it the German or

scho.ft

Zwangswirt­

system1 - differs from the first one in that it, seemingly and

nominally, maintains private ownership of the means of production,
entrepreneurship, and market exchange. So-called entrepreneurs
do the buying and selling, pay the workers, contract debts and pay
interest and amortization. But they are no longer entrepreneurs. In
Nazi Germany they were called shop managers or Betriebsfiihrer. The
government tells these seeming entrepreneurs what and how to pro­
duce, at what prices and from whom to buy, at what prices and to
whom

to sell. The government decrees at what wages labourers
work, and to whom and under what terms the capitalists

wages and interest rates are fixed by the authority, they are

prices, wages and interest rates in appearance only; in fact they are
merely quantitative terms in the authoritarian orders determining
each citizen's income, consumption and standard ofliving. The author­
ity, not the consumers, directs production. The central board of pro­

civil servants.
capitalism.

This is socialism with the outward appearance of

Some labels of the capitalistic market economy are

retained, but they signify here something entirely different from what
they mean in the market economy.
It is necessary to point out this fact to prevent a confusion of
socialism and interventionism. The system of the hampered market

lent for :(,wangswirlschaft is something like compulsory economy.
529

EPILOGUE
economy, or interventionism, differs from socialism by the very fact
that it is still market economy. The authority seeks to influence the
market by the intervention of its coercive power, but it does not want
to eliminate the market altogether. It desires that production and
consumption should develop along lines different from those pre­
scribed by the unhindered market, and it wants to achieve its aim by
injecting into the working of the market orders, commands and
prohibitions for whose enforcement the police power and its appara­
tus of coercion and compulsion stand ready. But these are isolated
interventions; their authors assert that they do not plan to combine
these measures into a completely integrated system which regulates
all prices, wages and interest rates, and which thus places full control
of production and consumption in the hands of the authorities.
However, all the methods of interventionism are doomed to
failure. This means : the interventionist measures must needs result
in conditions whichfrom the point of view of their own advocates are more
unsatisfactory than the previous state of affairs they were designed
to alter. These policies are therefore contrary to purpose.
Minimum wage rates, whether enforced by government decree or
by labour union pressure and compulsion, are useless if they fix wage
rates at the market level. But if they try to raise wage rates above
the level which the unhampered labour market would have deter­
mined, they result in permanent unemployment of a great part of
the potential labour force.
Government spending cannot create additional jobs. If the
government provides the funds required by taxing the citizens or
by borrowing from the public, it abolishes on the one hand as many
jobs as it creates on the other. If government spending is financed
by borrowing from the commercial banks, it means credit expansion
and inflation. If in the course of such an inflation the rise in com­
modity prices exceeds the rise in nominal wage rates, unemployment
will drop. But what makes unemployment shrink is precisely the
fact that real wage rates are falling.
The inherent tendency of capitalist evolution is to raise real wage
rates steadily. This is the effect of the progressive accumuiation of
capital by means of which technological methods of production are
improved. There is no means by which the height of wage rates
can be raised for all those eager to earn wages other than through
the increase of the per capita quota of capital invested. Whenever

530

EPILOGUE

the accumulation of additional capital stops, the tendency towards a
further increase in real wage rates comes to a standstill. If capital
consumption is substituted for an increase in capital available, real
wage rates must drop temporarily until the checks on a further increase
in capital are removed. Government measures which retard capital
accumulation or lead to capital consumption - such as confiscatory
taxation - are therefore detrimental to the vital interests of the
workers.
Credit expansion can bring about a temporary boom. But such a
fictitious prosperity must end in a general depression of trade, a
slump.
It can hardly be asserted that the economic history of the last
decadt'.8 has run counter to the pessimistic predictions of the econ­
omists. Our age has to face great economic troubles. But this is not
a crisis of capitalism. It is the crisis of interventionism, of policies
designed to improve capitalism and to substitute a better system for it.
No economist ever dared to assert that interventionism could
result in anything else than in disaster and chaos. The advocates
of interventionism - foremost among them the Prussian Historical
School and the American Institutionalists - were not economists.
On the contrary. In order to promote their plans they flatly denied
that there is any such thing as economic law. In their opinion gov­
ernments are free to achieve all they aim at without being restrained
by an inexorable regularity in the sequence of economic phenomena.
Like the German socialist Ferdinand Lassalle, they maintain that
the State is God.
The interventionists do not approach the study of economic
matters with scientific disinterestedness. Most of them are driven
by an envious resentment against those whose incomes are larger
than their own. This bias makes it impossible for them to see things
as they really are. For them the main thing is not to improve the
conditions of the masses, but to harm the entrepreneurs and capi­
talists even if this policy victimizes the immense majority of the
people.
In the eyes of the interventionists the mere existence of profits is
objectionable. They speak ofprofit without dealing with its corollary,
loss. They do not comprehend that profit and loss are the instruments
by means of which the consumers keep a tight rein on all entre­
preneurial activities. It is profit and loss that make the consumers
53 1

EPILOGUE

supreme in the direction of business. It is absurd to contrast pro­
duction for profit and production for use. On the unhampered mar­
ket a man can earn profits only by supplying the consumers in the
best and cheapest way with the goods they want to use. Profit and
loss withdraw the material factors of production from the hands of
the inefficient and place them in the hands of the more efficient. It
is their social function to make a man the more influential in the
conduct of business the better he succeeds in producing commodities
for which people scramble. The consumers suffer when the laws of
the country prevent the most efficient entrepreneurs from expanding
the sphere of their activities. What made some enterprises develop
into 'big business' was precisely their success in filling best the
demand of the masses.
Anti-capitalistic policies sabotage the operation of the capitalist
system of the market economy. The failure of interventionism does
not demonstrate the necessity of adopting socialism. It merely ex­
poses the futility of interventionism. All those evils which the self­
styled 'progressives' interpret as evidence of the failure of capitalism
are the outcome of their allegedly beneficial interference with the
market. Only the ignorant, wrongly identifying interventionism and
capitalism, believe that the remedy for these evils is socialism.

The Dictatorial, Anti-democratic and Socialist Character of
Interventionism
Many advocates of interventionism are bewildered when one tells
them that in recommending interventioni�m they themselves are
fostering anti-democratic and dictatorial tendencies and the estab­
lishment of totalitarian socialism. They protest that they are sincere
believers and opposed to tyranny and socialism. What they aim at is
only the improvement of the conditions of the poor. They say that
they are driven by considerations of social justice, and favour a fairer
distribution of income precisely because they are intent upon pre­
serving capitalism and its political corollary or superstructure, viz.,
democratic government.
What these people fail to realize is that the various measures they

53 2

EPILOGUE

suggest are not capable of bringing about the beneficial results aimed
at. On the contrary they produce a state of affairs which from the
point of view of their advocates is worse than the previous state
which they were designed to alter. If the government, faced with this
failure of its first intervention, is not prepared to undo its inter­
ference with the market and to return to a free economy, it must add
to its first measure more and more regulations and restrictions.
Proceeding step by step on this way it finally reaches a point in which
all economic freedom of individuals has disappeared. Then socialism
of the German pattern, the Zwangswirtscho,ft of the Nazis, emerges.
We have already mentioned the case of minimum wage rates. Let
us illustrate the matter further by an analysis of a typical case of price
control.
If the government wants to make it possible for poor parents to
give more milk to their children, it must buy the milk at the market
price and sell it to those poor people with a loss at a cheaper rate;
the loss may be covered from the means collected by taxation. But
if the government simply fixes the price of milk at a lower rate than
the market, the results obtained will be contrary to the aims of the
government. The marginal producers will, in order to avoid losses,
go out of the business of producing and selling milk. There will be
less milk available for the consumers, not more. This outcome is
contrary to the government's intentions. The government interfered
because it considered milk as a vital necessity. It did not want to
restrict its supply.
Now the government has to face the alternative : either to refrain
from any endeavours to control prices, or to add to its first measure
a second one, i.e., to fix the prices of the factors of production neces­
sary for the production of milk. Then the same story repeats itself
on a remoter plane : the government has again to fix the prices of
the factors of production necessary for the production of those factors
of production which are needed for the production of milk. Thus the
government has to go further and further, fixing the prices of all the
factors of production - both human (labour) and material - and
forcing every entrepreneur and every worker to continue work at
these prices and wages. No branch of production can be omitted
from this all-round fixing of prices and wages and this general order
to continue production. If some branches of production were left
free, the result would be a shifting of capital and labour to them and
5 33

'

EPILOGUE
a corresponding fall of the supply of the goods whose prices the
government had fixed. However, it is precisely these goods which
the government considers as especially important for the satisfaction
of the needs of the masses.
But when this state of all-round control of b usiness is achieved, the
market economy has been replaced by a system of planned economy,
by socialism. Of course, this is not the socialism of immediate state
management of every plant by the government as in Russia, but the
socialism of the German or Nazi pattern.
Many people were fascinated by the alleged success of German
price control. They said : You have only to be as brutal and ruthless
as the Nazis and you will succeed in controlling prices. What these
people, eager to fight Nazism by adopting its methods, did not see
was that the Nazis did not enforce price control within a market
society, but that they established a full socialist system, a totalitarian
commonweaith.
Price control is contrary to purpose if it is limited to some com­
modities only. I t cannot work satisfactorily within a market economy.
If the government does not draw from this failure the conclusion that
it must abandon all attempts to control prices, it must go further and
further until it substitutes socialist all-round planning for the market
economy.
Production can either be directed by the prices fixed on the market
by the buying and by the abstention from buying on the part of the
public. Or it can be directed by the government's central board of
production management. There is no third solution available. There
is no third social system feasible which would be neither market
economy nor socialism. Government control of only a part of prices
must result in a state of affairs which - without any exception ­
everybody considers as absurd and contrary to purpose. Its inevit­
able result is chaos and social unrest.
It is this that the economists have in mind in referring to economic
law and asserting that interventionism is contrary to economic law.
In the market economy the consumers are supreme. Their buying
and their abstention from buying ultimately determine what the
entrepreneurs produce and in what quantity and quaiity. it deter­
mines directly the prices of the consumers' goods and indirectly the
prices of all producers' goods, viz., labour and material factors of
production. It determines the emergence of profits and losses and

534

EPILOGU E
the formation of the rate of interest. It determines every individual's
income. The focal point of the market economy is the market, i.e.,
the process of the formation of commodity prices, wage rates and
interest rates and their derivatives, profits and losses. It makes all
men in their capacity as producers responsible to the consumers.
This dependence is direct with entrepreneurs, capitalists, farmers
and professional men, and indirect with people working for salaries
and wages. The market adjusts the efforts of all those engaged in
supplying the needs of the consumers to the wishes of those for whom
they produce, the consumers. It subj ects production to consumption.
The market is a democracy in which every penny gives a right to
vote. It is true that the various individuals have not the same power
to vote. The richer man casts more ballots than the poorer fellow.
But to be rich and to earn a higher income is, in the market economy,
already the outcome of a previous election. The only means to
acquire wealth and to preserve it, in a market econmny not adul­
terated by government-made privileges and restrictions, is to serve
the consumers in the best and cheapest way. Capitalists and land­
owners who fail in this regard suffer losses. If they do not change
their procedure, they lose their wealth and become poor. It is the
consumers who make poor people rich and rich people poor. It is
the consumers who fix the wages of a movie star and an opera singer
at a higher level than those of a welder or an accountant.
Every individual is free to disagree with the outcome of an election
campaign or of the market process. But in a democracy he has no
other means to alter things than persuasion. If a man were to say:
'I do not like the mayor elected by majority vote; therefore I ask the
government to replace him by the man I prefer,' one would hardly
call him a democrat. But if the same claims are raised with regard
to the market, most people are too dull to discover the dictatorial
aspirations involved.
The consumers have made their choices and determined th�
income of the shoe manufa:cturer, the movie star and the welder.

would render the marginal farms, i.e., those producing under the
least favourable conditions, profitable. This is very unfortunate
indeed for the farmers concerned ; they must discontinue growing
cotton and try to integrate themselves in another way into the whole
of production.
But what shaH we think of the statesman who interferes by com­
pulsion in order to raise the price of cotton above the level it would
reach on the free market? What the interventionist aims at is the
substitution of police pressure for the choice of the consumers. All
this talk : the state should do this or that, ultimately means : the
police should force consumers to behave otherwise than they would

special rights. They are permitted to prevent non-members from
working. They are allowed to call a strike and, when on strike, are
virtually free to employ violence against all those who are prepared
to continue working, viz., the strikebreakers. This system assigns an
unlimited privilege to those engaged in vital branches of industry.
Those workers whose strike cuts off the supply of water, light, food
and other necessities are in a position to obtain all they want at the
expense of the rest of the population. It is true that in the United
States their unions have up to now �xercised some moderation in
taking advantage of this opportunity. Other American unions and
many European unions have been less cautious. They are intent
upon enforcing wage increases without bothering about the disaster
inevitably resulting.
The interventionists are not shrewd enough to realize that labour
union pressure and compulsion are absolutely incompatible with
any system of social organization. The union problem has no
reference whatsoever to the right of citizens to associate with one
another in assemblies and associations ; no democratic country denies
its citizens this right. Neither does anybody dispute a man's right
to stop work and to go on strike. The only question is whether or
not the unions should be granted the privilege of resorting with
impunity to violence.

This privilege is no less incompatible with

53 6

EPILOGUE
socialism than with capitalism. No social co-operation under the
division of labour is possible when some people or unions of people
are granted the right to prevent by violence and the threat of violence
other people from working. When enforced by violence, a strike in
vital branches of production or a general strike are tantamount to a
revolutionary destruction of society.
A government abdicates if it tolerates any non-governmental
agency's use of violence. If the government forsakes its monopoly of
coercion and compulsion, anarchic conditions result. If it were true
that a democratic system of government is unfit to protect uncon­
ditionally every individual's right to work in defiance of the orders
of a union, democracy would be doomed. Then dictatorship would
be the only means to preserve the division of labour and to avoid
anarchy. What generated dictatorship in Russia and Germany was

of union violence unfeasible under democratic conditions. The
dictators abolished strikes and thus broke the spine of labour
unionism. There is no question of strikes in the Soviet empire.
It is illusory to believe that arbitration of labour disputes could
bring the unions into the framework of the market economy and
make their functioning compatible with the preservation of domestic
peace. Judicial settlement of controversies is feasible if there is a set
of rules available, according to which individual cases can be judged.

But if such a code is valid and its provisions are applied to the deter­
mination of the height of wage rates, it is no longer the market which
fixes them, but the code and those who legislate with regard to it.
Then the government is supreme and no longer the consumers buy­
ing and selling on the market. If no such code exists, a standard
according to which a controversy between employers and employees
could be decided is lacking. It is vain to speak of 'fair' wages in the
absence of such a code. The notion of fairness is nonsensical if not
related to an established standard. In practice, if the employers
do not yield to the threats of the unions, arbitration is tantamount
to the determination of wage rates by the government-appointed
arbitrator. Peremptory authoritarian decision is substituted for the

market price. The issue is always the same : the government or the
market. There is no third solution.
Metaphors are often very useful in elucidating complicated pro­
blems and in making them comprehensible to less intelligent minds.

EPILOGUE

But they become misleading and result in nonsense if people forget
that every comparison is imperfect. It is silly to take metaphorical
idioms literally and to deduce from their interpretation features of
the object one wished to make more easily understandable by their
use. There is no harm in the economists' description of the operation
of the market as automatic and in their custom of speaking of the
anonymous forces operating on the market. They could not anticipate
that anybody would be so stupid as to take these metaphors literaJIy.
No 'automatic' and 'anonymous' forces actuate the 'mechanism'
of the market. The only factors directing the market and determin­
ing prices are purposive acts of men. There is no automatism; there
are men consciously aiming at ends chosen and deliberately resorting
to definite means for the attainment of these ends. There are no
mysterious mechanical forces; there is only the will of every individual
to satisfv his demand for various goods. There is no anonvmitv:
there are you and I and Bill and Joe and all the rest. And each of
us is engaged both in production and consumption. Each contributes
his share to the determination of prices.
The dilemma is not between automatic forces and planned action.
It is between the democratic process of the market in which every
individual has his share and the exclusive rule of a dictatorial body.
Whatever people do in the market economy, is the execution of their
own plans. I n this sense every human action means planning. What
those calling themselves planners advocate is not the substitution of
planned action for letting things go. It is the substitution of the
planner's own plan for the plans of his fellow-men. The planner is a
potential dictator who wants to deprive all other people of the power
to plan and act according to their own plans. He aims at one thing
only: the exclusive absolute pre-eminence of his own plan.
It is no less erroneous to declare that a government that is not
socialistic has no plan. Whatever a government does is the execution
of a plan, i.e., of a design. One may disagree with such a plan. But
one must not say that it is not a plan at all. Professor Wesley C.
Mitchell maintained that the British liberal government 'planned to
have no plan'.1 However, the British government in the liberal age
certainly had a definite plan. Its plan was private ownership of the
means of production, free initiative and market economy. Great

EPILOGUE
Britain was very prosperous indeed under this plan which according
to Professor Mitchell is 'no plan' .
The planners pretend that their plans are scientific and that there
cannot be disagreement with regard to them among well-intentioned
and decent people. However, there is no such thing as a scientific
ought. Science is competent to establish what is. It can never dictate
what ought to be and what ends people should aim at. It is a fact
that men disagree in their value judgments. It is insolent to arrogate
to oneself the right to overrule the plans of other people and to force
them to submit to the plan of the planner. Whose plan should be
executed? The plan of the CIO or those of any other group? The
plan of Trotsky or that of Stalin?

The plan of Hitler or that of

Strasser?
When people were committed to the idea that in the field of
religion only one plan must be adopted, bloody wars resulted. With
the acknowledgment of the principle of religious freedom these
wars ceased. The market economy safeguards peaceful economic
co-operation because it does not use force upon the economic plans
of the citizens. If one master plan is to be substituted for the plans
of each citizen, endless fighting must emerge. Those who disagree
with the dictator's plan have no other means to carry on than to
defeat the despot by force of arms.

It is an illusion to believe that a system of planned socialism could
be operated according to democratic methods of government.
Democracy is inextricably linked with capitalism. It cannot exist
where there is planning. Let us refer to the words of the most
eminent of the contemporary advocates of socialism. Professor
Harold Laski declared that the attainment of power by the British
Labour Party in the normal parliamentary fashion must result in a
radical transformation of parliamentary government.

A socialist

administration needs 'guarantees' that its work of transformation
would not be 'disrupted' by repeal in event of its defeat at the polls.
Therefore the suspension of the Constitution is 'inevitable' . 1 How
pleased would Charles I and George III have been if they had
known the books of Professor Laski !
Sidney and Beatrice Webb (Lord and Lady Passfield) tell us that
'in any corporate action a loyal unity of thought is so important that,
if anything is to be achieved, public discussion must be suspended
1 Cf. wki, Dmwcraey in Crisis (Chapel
539

Hill

1933). pp. 87-8.

EPILOGUE
between the promulgation of the decision and the accomplishment
of the task' . Whilst 'the work is in progress' any expression of doubt,
or even of fear that the plan will not be successful, is 'an act of dis­
loyalty, or even of treachery' .l Now as the process of production
never ceases and some work is always in progress and there is always
something to be achieved, it f9ilows that a socialist government must
never concede any freedom of speech and the press. 'A loyal unity
of thought', what a high-sounding circumlocution for the ideals of
Philip II and the inquisition !

In this regard another eminent ad­

mirer ofthe Soviets, Mr. T. G. Crowther, speaks without any reserve.
He plainly declares that inquisition is ' beneficial to science when it
protects a rising class',' i.e., when Mr. Crowther's friends resort to
it. Hundreds of similar dicta could be quoted.
In the Victorian age, when John Stuart Mill wrote his essay

On Liheriy, such views as those heid by Professor Laski, Mr. and
Mrs. Webb and Mr. Crowther were called reactionary. Today they
are called 'progressive' and 'liberal'. On the other hand people who
oppose the suspension of parliamentary government and of the free­
dom of speech and the press and the establishment of inquisition are
scorned as 'reactionaries', as 'economic royalists' and as 'Fascists' .
Those interventionists who consider interventionism as a method
of bringing about full socialism step by step are at least consistent.
If the measures adopted fail to achieve the beneficial results expected
and end in disaster, they ask for more and more government inter­
ference until the government has taken over the direction of all
economic activities. But those interventionists who look at inter­
ventionism as a means of improving capitalism and thereby preserv­
ing it are utterly confused.
In the eyes of these people all the undesired and undesirable effects
of government interference with business are caused by capitalism.
The very fact that a governmental measure has brought about a
state of affairs which they dislike is for them a justification of further
measures. They fail, for instance, to realize that the role monopolistic
schemes play in our time is the effect of government interference such
as tariffs and patents. They advocate government action for the
prevention of monopoly.

One could hardly imagine a more un-

realistic idea. For the governments whom they ask to fight monopoly
are the same governments who are devoted to the principle of mono­
poly. Thus, the American New Deal Government embarked upon a
thorough-going monopolistic organization of every branch of Ameri­
can business, by the NRA, and aimed at organizing American
farming as a vast monopolistic scheme, restricting farm output for
the sake of substituting monopoly prices for the lower market prices.
I t was a party to various international commodity control agree­
ments the undisguised aim of which was to establish international
monopolies of various commodities. The same is true of all other
governments. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was also a
party to some of these intergovernmental monopolistic conventions. 1
Its repugnance for collaboration with the capitalistic countries was
not so great as to cause it to miss any opportunity for fostering
monopoly.
The programme of this self-contradictory interventionism is dic­
tatorship, supposedly to make people free. But the liberty its sup­
porters advocate is liberty to do the 'right' things, i.e., the things
they themselves want to be done. They are not only ignorant of
the economic problems involved. They lack the faculty of logical
thinking.
The most absurd justification of interventionism is provided by
those who look upon the conflict between capitalism and socialism
as if it were a contest over the distribution of income. Why should
not the propertied classes be more compliant? Why should they not
accord to the poor workers a part of their ample revenues? Why
should they oppose the government's design to raise the share of the
underprivileged by decreeing minimum wage rates and maximum
prices and by cutting profits and interest rates down to a 'fairer'
level? Pliability in such matters, they say, would take the wind from
the sails of the radical revolutionaries and preserve capitalism. The
worst enemies of capitalism, they say, are those intransigent doe..
trinaires whose excessive advocacy ofeconomic freedom, of laisser-faire
and Manchesterism renders vain all attempts to come to a compro­
mise with the claims of labour. These adamant reactionaries are
alone responsible for the bitterness of contemporary party strife and
the implacable hatred it generates. What is needed is the substitution
1 Cf. The collection of these conventions, published by The International Labour Office
under the title Intergovernmental Commodity Control Agreements (Montreal, 1 943).

EPILOGUE

of a constructive programme fur the purely negative attitude of the
economic royalists. And, of course, 'constructive' is in the eyes of
these people only interventionism.
However, this mode of reasoning is entirely vicious. It takes for
granted that the various measures of government interference with
business will attain those beneficial results which their advocates
expect from them. I t blithely disregards all that economics says
about their futility in attaining the ends sought, and their unavoid­
able and undesirable consequences. The question is not whether
minimum wage rates are fair or unfair, but whether or not they
bring about unemployment of a part of those eager to work. By
calling these measures just, the interventionist does not refute the
objections raised against their expediency by the economists. He
merely displays ignorance of the question at issue.
The conflict between capitalism and socialism is not a contest be­
tween two groups of claimants concerning the size of the portions to
be allotted to each of them out of a definite supply of goods. It is a
dispute concerning what system of social organization best serves
human welfare. Those fighting socialism do not reject socialism
because they envy the workers the benefits they (the workers) could
allegedly derive from the socialist mode of production. They fight
socialism precisely because they are convinced that it would harm the
masses in reducing them to the status of poor serfs entil ely at the
mercy of irresponsible dictators.
In this conflict of opinions everybody must make up his mind and
take a definite stand. Everybody must side either with the advocates
of economic freedom or with those of totalitarian socialism. One
cannot evade this dilemma by adopting an allegedly middle-of-the­
road position, namely interventionism. For interventionism is
neither a middle way nor a compromise between capitalism and
socialism. It is a third system. It is a system the absurdity and
futility of which is agreed upon not only by all economists but even
by the Marxians.
There is no such thing as an 'excessive' advocacy of economic
freedom. On the one hand, production can be directed by the
efforts of each individual to adjust his conduct so as to fill the most
urgent wants of the consumers in the most appropriate way. This is
the market economy. On the other hand, production can be directed
by authoritarian decree. If these decrees concern only some isolated
542

EPILOGUE

items of the economic structure, they fail to attain the ends sought,
and their own advocates do not like their outcome. If they come up
to all-round regimentation, they mean totalitarian socialism.
Men must choose between the market economy and socialism.
The state can preserve the market economy in protecting life, health
and private property against violent or fraudulent aggression; or it
can itself control the conduct of all production activities. Some
agency must determine what should be produced. If it is not the
consumers by means of demand and supply on the market, it must
be the government by compulsion.

Socialism and Communism
In the terminology of Marx and Engels the words communism
and socialism are synonymous. They are alternately applied without
any distinction between them. The same was true for the practice
of all Marxian groups and sects until 1 9 1 7. The political parties of
Marxism which considered the Communist Manifesto as the unalter­
able gospel of their doctrine called themselves socialist parties. The
most influential and most numerous of these parties, the German
party, adopted the name Social Democratic Party. In Italy, in
France and in all other countries in which Marxian parties already
played a role in political life before 1 9 1 7, the term socialist likewise
superseded the term communist. No Marxian ever ventured, before
1 9 1 7, to distinguish between communism and socialism.
In 1 875, in his Criticism of the Gotha Programme of the German
Social Democratic Party, Marx distinguished between a lower
(earlier) and a higher (later) phase of the future communist society.
But he did not reserve the name of communism to the higher phase,
and did not call the lower phase socialism as differentiated from
communism.
One of the fundamental dogmas of Marx is that socialism is
bound to come 'with the inexorability of a law of nature'. Capitalist
production begets its own negation and establishes the socialist
system of public ownership of the means of production. This process
'executes itself through the operation of the inherent laws of capitalist
543

EPILOGUE
production'. 1 It is independent of the wills of people. a It is impossible
for men to accelerate it, to delay it or to hinder it. For 'no social
system ever disappears before all the productive forces are developed
for the development of which it is broad enough, and new higher
methods of production never appear before the material conditions
of their existence have been hatched out in the womb of previous
society' .·

This doctrine is, of course, irreconcilable with Marx's own political
activities and with the teachings he advanced for the justification of
these activities. Marx tried to organize a political party which by
means of revolution and civil war should accomplish the transition
from capitalism to socialism.

The characteristic feature of their

parties was, in the eyes of Marx and all Marxian doctrinaires, that
they were revolutionar:y parties invariably committed to the idea of
violent action. Their aim was to rise in rebellion, to establish the
dictatorship of the proletarians and to exterminate mercilessly all
bourgeois. The deeds of the Paris Communards in 1 87 1 were con­
sidered as the perfect model of such a civil war. The Paris revolt,
of course, had lamentably failed. But later uprisings were expected
to succeed.'
However, the tactics applied by the Marxian parties in various
European countries were irreconcilably opposed to each of these two
contradictory varieties of the teachings of Karl Marx. They did not
place confidence in the inevitability of the coming of socialism.
Neither did they trust in the success of a revolutionary upheaval.
They adopted the methods of parliamentary action. They solicted
votes in election campaigns and sent their delegates into the parlia­
ments. They 'degenerated' into democratic parties. In the parlia­
ments they behaved like other parties of the opposition. In some
countries they entered into temporary alliances with other parties,
and occasionally socialist members sat in the cabinets. Later, after
the end of the first World War, the socialist parties became para­
mount in many parliaments. In some countries they ruled exclu­
sively, in others in close co-operation with 'bourgeois' parties.
It is true that these domesticated socialists before 1 9 1 7 never
abandoned lip service to the rigid principles of orthodox Marxism.

They repeated again and again that the coming of socialism is un­
avoidable. They emphasized the inherent revolutionary character
of their parties. Nothing could arouse their anger more than when
somebody dared to dispute their adamant revolutionary spirit.
However, in fact they were parliamentary parties like all other
parties.
From a correct Marxian point of view, as expressed in the later
writings of Marx and Engels (but not yet in the Communist Mani­
festo) , all measures designed to restrain, to regulate and to improve
capitalism were simply 'petty-bourgeois' nonsense stemming from
an ignorance of the immanent laws of capitalist evolution. True
socialists should not place any obstacles in the way of capitalist
evolution. For only the full maturity of capitalism could bring
about socialism. It is not only vain, but harmful to the interests
of the proletarians to resort to such measures. Even labour-unionism
is not an adequate means for the improvement of the conditions of
the workers. 1 Marx did not believe that interventionism could
benefit the masses. He violently rejected the idea that such measures
as minimum wage rates, price ceilings, restriction of interest rates,
social security and so on are preliminary steps in bringing about
socialism. He aimed at the radical abolition of the wages system
which can be accomplished only by communism in its higher phase.
He would have sarcastically ridiculed the idea of abolishing the
'commodity character' of labour within the frame of a capitalist
society by the enactment of a law.
But the socialist parties as they operated in the European countries
were virtually no less committed to interventionism than the So;:;ial­
politik of the Kaiser's Germany and the American New Deal. It was
against this policy that Georges Sorel and Syndicalism directed their
attacks. Sorel, a timid intellectual of a bourgeois background,
deprecated the 'degeneration' of the socialist parties for which he
blamed their penetration by bourgeois intellectuals. He wanted to
see the spirit of ruthless aggressiveness, inherent in the masses,
revived and freed from the guardianship of intellectual cowards.
For Sorel nothing counted but riots. He advocated action dirtcte, i.e.,
sabotage and the generai strike, as initiatory steps towards the finai
great revolution.

EPILOGUE
Sorel had success mostly among snobbish and idle intellectuals and
no less snobbish and idle heirs of wealthy entrepreneurs. He did not
perceptibly move the masses. For the Marxian parties in Western
and Central Europe his passionate criticism was hardly more than a
nuisance. His historical importance consisted mainly in the role his
ideas played in the evolution of Russian Bolshevism and Italian
Fascism.
In order to understand the mentality of the Bolshevists we must
again refer to the dogmas of Karl Marx. Marx was fully convinced
that capitalism is a stage of economic history which is not limited to
a few advanced countries only. Capitalism has the tendency to
convert all parts of the world into capitalist countries. The bourgeoisie
forces all nations to become capitalist nations. When the final hour
of capitalism sounds, the whole world will be uniformly in the stage
of mature capitalism, ripe for the transition to socialism. Socialism
will emerge at the same time in all parts of the world.
Marx erred on this point no less than in all his other statements.
Today even the Marxians cannot and do not deny that there still
prevail enormous differences in the development of capitalism in
various countries. They realize that there are many countries which,
from the point of view of the Marxian interpretation of history, must
be described as precapitalistic. In these countries the bourgeoisie
has not yet attained a ruling position and has not yet set the historical
stage of capitalism which is the necessary prerequisite of the appear­
ance of socialism. These countries therefore must first accomplish
their 'bourgeois revolution' and must go through all phases of
capitalism before there can be any question of transforming them
into socialist countries. The only policy which Marxians could
adopt in such countries would be to support the bourgeois un­
conditionally, first in their endeavours to seize power and then in
their capitalistic ventures. A Marxian party could for a very long
time have no other task than to be subservient to bourgeois liberal­
ism. This alone is the mission which historical materialism, if
consistently applied, could assign to Russian Marxians. They would
be forced to wait quietly until capitalism should have made their
nation ripe for socialism.
But the Russian Marxians did not want to wait. They resorted to
a new modification of Marxism according to which it was possible
for a nation to skip one of the stages of historical evolution. They
546

EPILOGUE

shut their eyes to the fact that this new doctrine was not a modifica­
tion of Marxism, but rather the denial of the last remnant which
was left of it. It was an undisguised return to the pre-Marxian and
anti-Marxian socialist teachings according to which men are free to
adopt socialism at any time if they consider it as a system more
beneficial to the commonweal than capitalism. It utterly exploded
all the mysticism inwrought into dialectical materialism and in the
alleged Marxian discovery of the inexorable laws of mankind's
economic evolution.
Having emancipated themselves from Marxian determinism, the
Russian Marxians were free to discuss the most appropriate tactics
for the realization of socialism in their country. They were no longer
bothered with economic problems. They had no longer to investigate
whether or not the time had come. They had only one task to
accomplish, the seizure of the reins of government.
One group maintained that iasting success couid be expected oniy
if the support of a sufficient number of the people, though not
necessarily of the majority, could be won. Another group did not
favour such a time-con.'mming procedure. They suggested a bold
stroke. A smail group of fanatics should be organized as the vanguard
of the revolution. Strict discipline and unconditional obedience to
the chief should make these professional revolutionists fit for a
sudden attack. They should supplant the Czarist government and
then rule the country according to the traditional methods of the
Czar's police.
The terms used to signify these two groups - Bolshevists (majority)
for the latter and Mensheviks (minority) for the former - refer to a
vote taken in I g03 at a meeting held for the discussion of these
tactical issues. The only difference dividing the two groups from
one another was this matter of tactical methods. They both agreed
with regard to the ultimate end : socialism.
Both sects tried to justify their respective points of view by quoting
passages from Marx's and Engels's writings. This is, of course, the
Marxian custom. And each sect was in a position to discuver in
these sacred books dicta confirming its own stand.
Lenin, the Boishevist chief, knew his countrymen much better
than his adversaries and their leader, Plekhanov, did. He did not,
like Plekhanov, make the mistake of applying to Russians the
standards ofthe Western nations. He remembered how foreign women
547

EPILOGUE

had twice simply usurped supreme power and quietly ruled for a
life-time. He was aware of the fact that the terrorist methods of the
Czar's secret police were successful and he wa'l confident that he
could considerably improve on these methods. He was a ruthless
dictator and he knew that the Russians lacked the courage to resist
oppression. Like Cromwell, Robespierre and Napoleon, he was an
ambitious usurper and fully trusted the absence of revolutionary
spirit in the immense majority. The autocracy of the Romanovs was
doomed because the unfortunate Nicholas 11 was a weakling. The
socialist lawyer Kerensky failed because he was committed to the
principle of parliamentary government. Lenin succeeded because he
never aimed at anything else than his own dictatorship. And the
Russians yearned for a dictator, for a successor of the Terrible Ivan.
The rule of Nicholas 11 was not ended by a real revolutionary
upheaval. It collapsed on the battlefields. Anarchy resulted which
Kerensky couid not master. A skirmish in the streets of Saint Peters­
burg removed Kerensky. A �ort time later Lenin had his eighteenth
Brumaire. In spite of all the terror practised by the Bolshevists the
Constituent Assembly, elected by universal franchise for men and
women, had only about twenty per cent Bolshevist members.
Lenin dispelled by force of arms the Constituent Assembly. The
short-lived 'liberal' interlude was liquidated. Russia passed from
the hands of the inept Romanovs into those of a real autocrat.
Lenin did not content himself with the conquest of Russia. He
was fully convinced that he was destined to bring the bliss of socialism
to all nations, not only to Russia. The official name which he chose
for his government - Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics - does
not contain any reference to Russia. It was designed as the nucleus
of a world government. It was implied that all foreign comrades by
rights owed allegiance to this government and that all foreign
bourgeois who dared to resist were guilty of high treason and
deserved capital punishment. Lenin did not doubt in the least that
all Western countries were on the eve of the great final revolution.
He daily expected its outbreak.
There was in the opinion of Lenin only one group in Europe that
might - although without any prospect of success - try to prevent
the revolutionary upheaval: the depraved members of the intelli­
gentsia who had usurped the leadership of the socialist parties.
Lenin had long hated these men for their addiction to parliamentary
548

EPILOGUE
procedure and their reluctance to endorse his dictatorial aspirations.
He raged against them because he held them responsible for the
fact that the socialist parties had supported the war effort of their
countries. Already in his Swiss exile, which ended in 1 9 1 7, Lenin
began to split the European socialist parties. Now he set up a new,
a Third International which he controlled in the same dictatorial
manner in which he directed the Russian Bolshevists. For this new
party Lenin chose the name Communist Party. The communists
were to fight unto death the various European socialist parties,
these 'social traitors', and they were to arrange the immediate
liquidation of the bourgeoisie and seizure of power by the armed
workers. Lenin did not differentiate between socialism and com­
munism as social systems. The goal which he aimed at was not
called communism as opposed to socialism. The official name of the
Soviet government is U nion of the Socialist (not of the Communist)
Soviet F_epublics. In this regard he did not ,,,,ant to alter the
traditional terminology which considered the terms as synonymous.
He merely called his partisans, the only sincere and consistent
supporters of the revolutionary principles of orthodox Marxism,
communists and their tactical methods communism because he wanted
to distinguish them from the 'treacherous hirelings of the capitalist
exploiters', the wicked Social Democratic leaders like Kautsky and
Albert Thomas. These traitors, he emphasized, were anxious to
preserve capitalism. They were not true socialists. The only
genuine Marxians were those who rej ected the name of socialists)
irremediably fallen into disrepute.
Thus the distinction between communists and socialists came into
being. Those Marxians who did not surrender to the dictator in
Moscow called themselves social democrats or, in short, socialists.
What characterized them was the belief that the most appropriate
method for the realization of their plans to establish socialism, the
final goal common to them as well as to the communists, was to win
the support of the majority of their fellow-citizens. They abandoned
the revolutionary slogans and tried to adopt democratic methods for
the seizure of power. They did not bother about the problem
whether or not a socialist regime is compatible with democracy. But
for the attainment of socialism they were resolved to apply demo­
cratic procedures.
The communists, on the other hand, were in the early years of the
549

EPILOGUE
Third International firmly committed to the principle of revolution
and civil war. They were loyal only to their Russian chief. They
expelled from their ranks everybody who was suspected of feeling
himself bound by any of his country's laws. They plotted un­
ceasingly and squandered blood in unsuccessful riots.
Lenin could not understand why the communists failed every­
where outside Russia. He did not expect much from the American
workers. In the United States, the communists agreed, the workers
lacked the revolutionary spirit because they were spoiled by well­
being and steeped in the vice of money-making. But Lenin did not
doubt that the European masses were class-conscious and therefore
fully committed to revolutionary ideas. The only reason why the
revolution had not been realized was in his opinion the inadequacy
and cowardice of the communist officials. Again and again he
deposed his vicars and appointed new men. But he did not succeed
any better.
In the Anglo-Saxon and in the Latin-American countries the
socialist voters place confidence in democratic methods. Here the
number of people who seriously aim at a communist revolution is
very small. Most of those who publicly proclaim their adherence to
the principles of communism would feel extremely unhappy if the
revolution were to arise and expose their lives and their property to
danger. If the Russian armies were to march into their countries or
if domestic communists were to seize power without engaging them
in the fight, they would probably rejoice in the hope of being
rewarded for their Marxian orthodoxy. But they themselves do not
long for revolutionary laurels.
I t is a fact that in all these thirty years of passionate pro-Soviet
agitation not a single country outside Russia went communist of its
citizens' own accord. Eastern Europe turned to communism only
when the diplomatic arrangements of international power politics
had converted it into a sphere of exclusive Russian influence and
hegemony. It is unlikely that Western Germany, France, Italy and
Spain will espouse communism if the United States and Great
Britain do not adopt a policy of absolute diplomatic 'desintiresse­
ment'. What gives strength to the communist movement in these and
in some other countries is the belief that Russia is driven by an
unflinching 'dynamism' while the Anglo-Saxon powers are indiffer­
ent and not very much interested in their fate.

EPILOGUE
Marx and the Marxians erred lamentably when they assumed that
the masses long for a revolutionary overthrow of the 'bourgeois'
order of society. The militant communists are to be found only in
the ranks of those who make a living from their communism or
expect that a revolution would further their personal ambitions.
The subversive activities of these professional plotters are dangerous
precisely on account of the naivety of those who are merely flirting
with the revolutionary idea. Those confused and misguided sym­
pathizers who call themselves 'liberals' and whom the communists
call 'useful innocents', the fellow-travellers and even the majority of
the officially registered party members, would be terribly frightened
if they were to discover one day that their chiefs mean business
when preaching sedition. But then it may be too late to avert
disaster.
For the time being, the ominous peril of the communist parties in
the West lies in their stand on foreign affairs. The distinctive mark
of all present-day communist parties is their devotion to the aggres­
sive foreign policy of the Soviets. Whenever they must choose
between Russia and their own country, they do not hesitate to prefer
Russia. Their principle is : Right or wrong, my Russia. They
strictly obey all orders issued from Moscow. When Russia was an
ally of Hitler, the French communists sabotaged their own country's
war effort and the American communists passionately opposed
President Roosevelt's plans to aid England and France in their
struggle against the Nazis. The communists all over the world
branded all those who defended themselves against the German
invaders as 'imperialist warmongers'. But as soon as Hitler attacked
Russia, the imperialist war of the capitalists changed over-night into
a just war of defence. Whenever Stalin conquers one more country,
the communists justify this aggression as an act of self-defence
against 'Fascists'.
In their blind worship of everything that is Russian, the com­
munists of Western Europe and the United States by far surpass the
worst excesses ever committed by chauvinists. They wax rapturous
about Russian movies, Russian music and the alleged aiscoveries of
Russian science. They speak in ecstatic words about the economic
achievements of the Soviets. They ascribe the victory of the United
Nations to the deeds of the Russian armed forces. Russia, they
contend, has saved the world from the Fascist menace. Russia is the
55 1

EPILOGUE

only free country while all other nations are subject to the dictator­
ship of the capitalists. The Russians alone are happy and enjoy the
bliss of living a full life ; in the capitalist countries the immense
majority are suffering from frustration and unfulfilled desires. Just
as the pious Muslim yearns for a pilgrimage to the Prophet's tomb
at Mecca, so the communist intellectual deems a pilgrimage to the
holy shrines of Moscow as the event of his life.
However, the distinction in the use of the terms communists and
socialists did not affect the meaning of the terms communism and
socialism as applied to the final goal of the policies common to them
both. It was only in 1 928 that the programme of the Communist
International, adopted by the sixth congress in Moscow, 1 began to
differentiate between communism and socialism (and not merely
between communists and socialists) .
According to this new doctrine there is, i n the economic evolution
of mankind, between the historical stage of capitalism and that of
communism, a third stage, namely that of socialism. Socialism is a
social system based on public control of the means of production and
full management of all processes of production and distribution by a
planning central authority. In this regard it is equal to communism.
But it differs from communism in so far as there is no equality of the
portions allotted to each individual for his own consumption.
There are still wages paid to the comrades and these wage rates are
graduated according to economic expediency as far as the central
authority deems it necessary for securing the greatest possible output
of products. What Stalin calls socialism corresponds by and large to
Marx's concept of the 'early phase' of communism. Stalin reserves
the term communism exclusively for what Marx called the 'higher
phase' of communism. Socialism, in the sense in which Stalin has
lately used the term, is moving towards communism, but is in itself
not yet communism. Socialism will turn into communism as soon
as the increase in wealth to be expected from the operation of the
socialist methods of production has raised the lower standard of
living of the Russian masses to the higher standard which the

EPILOGUE
The apologetical character of this new terminological practice is
obvious. Stalin finds it necessary to explain to the vast majority of
his subjects why their standard of living is extremely low, much
lower than that of the masses in the capitalist countries and even
lower than that of the Russian proletarians in the days of Czarist
rule. He wants to justify the fact that salaries and wages are unequal,
that a small group of Soviet officials enjoys all the luxuries modern
technique can provide, that a second group, more numerous than
the first one, but less numerous than the middle class in imperial
Russia, lives in 'bourgeois' style, while the masses, ragged and bare­
footed, subsist in congested slums and are poorly fed. He can no
longer blame capitalism for this state of affairs. Thus he was com­
pelled to resort to a new ideological makeshift.
Stalin's problem was the more burning as the Russian com­
munists in the early days of their rule had passionately proclaimed
income equaiity as a principie to be enforced from the first instant
of the proletarians' seizure of power. Moreover, in the capitalist
countries the most powerful demagogic trick applied by the Russia­
sponsored communist parties is to excite the envy of those with lower
incomes against all those with higher incomes. The main argument
advanced by the communists for the support of their thesis that
Hitler's National Socialism was not genuine socialism, but, on the
contrary, the worst variety of capitalism, was that there was in Nazi
Germany inequality in the standard of living.
Stalin's new distinction between socialism and communism is in
open contradiction to the policy of Lenin, and no less to the tenets of
the propaganda of the communist parties outside the Russian front­
iers. But such contradictions do not matter in the realm of the Soviets.
The word of the dictator is the ultimate decision, and nobody is so
foolhardy as to venture opposition.
It is important to realize that Stalin's semantical innovation
affects merely the terms communism and socialism. He did not alter
the meaning of the terms socialist and communist. The Bolshevist
party is just as before called communist. The Russophile parties
beyond the borders of the Soviet Union call themselves communist
parties and are vioientiy fighting the sociaiist parties which, in their
eyes, are simply social traitors. But the official name of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics remains unchanged.

§4
Russia's Aggressiveness
The German, Italian and Japanese nationalists justified their
aggressive policies by their lack of Lebensraum. Their countries
are comparatively overpopulated. They are poorly endowed by
nature and depend on the import of foodstuffs and raw materials
from abroad. They must export manufactures to pay for these
badly needed imports. But the protectionist policies espoused by
the countries producing a surplus of foodstuffs and raw materials
close their frontiers to import of manufactures. The world is mani­
festly tending towards a state of full economic autarky of each nation.
In such a world, what fate is in store for those nations who can
neither feed nor clothe their citizens out of domestic resources?
The Lebensraum doctrine of the self-styled 'have-not' peoples
emphasizes that there are in America and in Australia millions of
acres of unused land much more fertile than the barren soil which
the farmers of the have-not nations are tilling. Natural conditions
for mining and manufacturing are likewise much more propitious
than in the countries of the have-nots. But the German, Italian and
Japanese peasants and workers are barred from access to these areas
favoured by nature. The immigration laws of the comparatively
underpopulated countries prevent their migration. These laws raise
the marginal productivity of labour and thereby wage rates in the
underpopulated countries and lower them in the overpopulated
countries. The high standard of living in the United States and the
British Dominions is paid for by a lowering of the standard of living
in the congested countries of Europe and Asia.
The true aggressors, say these German, Italian and Japanese
nationalists, are those nations who by means of trade and migration
barriers have arrogated to themselves the lion's share of the natural
riches of the earth. Has not the Pope himself declared that the root
causes of the 'A/arId 'A/am are 'that cold and calculating egoism '''lhich
tends to hoard the economic resources and materials destined for the
use of all to such an extent that the nations less favoured by nature
are not permitted access to them'?l The war that Hitler, Mussolini
and Hirohito kindled was from this point of view a just war, for its

only aim was to give to the have-nots what, by virtue of natural
and divine right, belongs to them.
The Russians cannot venture to j ustify their aggressive policy by
such arguments. Russia is a comparatively underpopulated country.
Its soil is much better endowed by nature than that of any other
nation. It offers the most advantageous conditions for the growing
of all kinds of cereals, fruits, seeds and plants. Russia owns immense
pastures and almost inexhaustible forests. It has the richest resources
for the production of gold, silver, platinum, iron, copper, nickel,
manganese and all other metals, and of oil. But for the despotism of
the Czars and the lamentable inadequacy of the communist system,
its population could long since have enjoyed the highest standard of
living. It is certainly not lack of natural resources that pushes Russia
towards conquest.

was the leader of the final world revolution. He considered himself
as the legitimate successor of the First International, destined to
accomplish the task in which Marx and Engels had failed . The knell
of capitalism had sounded, and no capitalist machinations could
delay the expropriation of the expropriators any longer. What was
needed was only the dictator of the new social order. Lenin was
ready to take the burden upoh his shoulders.
Since the days of the Mongol invasions mankind has not had to
face such an unflinching and thorough-going aspiration for unlimited
world supremacy. In every country the Russian emissaries and the
communist fifth columns were fanatically working for the 'Anschluss'
to Russia. But Lenin lacked the first four columns. Russia's military
forces were at that time contemptible. When they crossed the Rus­
sian borders, they were stopped by the Poles. They could not march
further West. The great campaign for world conquest petered out.
It was just idle talk to discuss the problems whether communism
in one country only is possible or desirable. The communists had
failed utterly outside the Russian frontiers. They were forced to
stay at home.
Stalin devoted all his energy to the organization of a standing
army of a size the world had never seen before. But he was not more
successful than Lenin and Trotsky had been. The Nazis easily
defeated this army and occupied the most important part of Russia's
territory. Russia was saved by the British and, above all, by the
555

EPILOGUE
American forces. American lend-lease enabled the Russians to
follow on the heels of the Germans when the scarcity of equipment
and the threatening American invasion forced them to withdraw
from Russia. They could even occasionally defeat the rearguards
of the retreating Nazis. They could conquer Berlin and Vienna when
the American aeroplanes had smashed the German defences. When
the Americans had crushed the Japanese, the Russians could quietly
stab them in the back.
Of course, the communists inside and outside of Russia and the
fellow-travellers passionately contend that it was Russia that defeated
the Nazis and liberated Europe.

They pass over in silence the fact

that the only reason why the Nazis could not capture Moscow,
Leningrad and Stalingrad was their lack of munitions, aeroplaneS
and petrol. It was the blockade that made it impossible for the
Nazis to provide their annies with the equipment needed, and to
construct in the occupied Russian territory a transport system that
could ship this equipment to the far distant front line. The decisive
battle of the war was the battle of the Atlantic. The great strategical
events in the war against Germany were the conquest of Africa and
Sicily and the victory in Normandy. Stalingrad was, when measured
by the gigantic standards of this war, hardly more than a tactical
success. In the struggle against the Italians and the Japanese,
Russia's share was nil.
But the spoils of the victory go to Russia alone. While the other
United Nations do not seek for territorial aggrandizement, the
Russians are in full swing. They have annexed the three Baltic
Republics, Bessarabia, Czechoslovakia's province of Carpatho­
Russia,t a part of Finland, a great part of Poland and huge territories
in the Far East. They claim the rest of Poland, Rumania, Hungary,
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Korea and China as their exclusive sphere of
influence. They are anxious to establish in these countries 'friendly'
governments, i.e. puppet governments. But for the opposition raised
by the United States and Great Britain they would rule today in the
whole of continental Europe, continental Asia and Northern Africa.
Only the American and British garrisons in Germany bar the Rus­
sians' way to the shores of the Atlantic.
Today, no less than after the first World War, the real menace for

the West does not lie in the military power of Russia. G reat Britain
could easily repel a Russian attack and it would be sheer lunacy for
the Russians to undertake a war against the United States. Not the
Russian armies, but the communist ideologies threaten the West.
The Russians know it very well and place confidence not in their
own army, but in their foreign partisans. They want to overthrow
the democracies from within, not from without. Their main weapon
is the pro-Russian machinations of their Fifth Columns. These are
the crack divisions of Bolshevism.
The communist writers and politicians inside and outside of
Russia explain Russia's aggressive policies as mere self-defence. It
is, they say, not Russia that plans aggression but, on the contrary, the
decaying capitalist democracies. Russia wants merely to defend its
own independence. This is an old and well-tried method of justify­
ing aggression. Louis XIV and Napoleon I , Wilhelm 11 and Rider
were the most peace-loving of all men. When they invaded foreign
countries, they did so only in just self-defence. Russia was as much
menaced by Esthonia or Latvia as Germany was by Luxemburg or
Denmark.
An outgrowth of this fable of self-defence is the legend of the
cordon sanitaire. The political independence of the small neighbour
countries of Russia, it is maintained, is merely a capitalist makeshift
designed to prevent the European democracies from being infected
with the germ of communism. Hence, it is concluded, these small
nations have forfeited their right to independence. For Russia has
the inalienable right to claim that its neighbours - and likewise its
neighbours' neighbours - should only be ruled by 'friendly', i.e.
strictly communist, governments. What would happen to the world
if all great powers were to make the same pretension?
The truth is that it is not the governments of the democratic
nations that aim at overthrowing the present Russian system. They
do not foster pro-democratic fifth columns in Russia and they do not
incite the Russian masses against their rulers. But the Russians are
busy day and night fomenting unrest in every country.
The very lame and hesitant intervention of the Allied Nations in
the Russian Civil War was not a pro-capitalist and anti-communist
venture. For the Allied Nations, involved in their struggle for life
and death with the Germans, Lenin was at that time merely a tool of
their deadly foes. Ludendorff had dispatched Lenin to Russia in
55 7

EPILOGUE

order to overthrow the Kerensky regime and to bring about the
defection of Russia. The Bolshevists fought by force of arms all
those Russians who wanted to continue the alliance with France,
Great Britain and the United States. From a military point of view
it was impossible for the Western nations to stay neutral while their
Russian allies were desperately defending themselves against the
Bolshevists. For the Allied Nations the Eastern Front was at stake.
The cause of the 'White' generals was their own cause.
As soon as the war against Germany came to an end in 1 9 1 8, the
Allies lost interest in Russian affairs. There was no longer any need
for an Eastern Front. They did not care a whit about the internal
problems of Russia. They longed for peace and were anxious to
withdraw from the fighting. They were, of course, embarrassed
because they did not know how to liquidate their venture with
propriety. Their generals were ashamed of abandoning companions
in arms who had fought to the best of their abilities in a common
cause. To leave these men in the lurch was in their opinion nothing
short of cowardice and desertion. Such considerations of military
honour delayed for some time the withdrawal of the inconspicuous
Allied detachments and the termination of deliveries to the Whites.
When this was finally accomplished, the Allied statesmen felt
relief. From then on they adopted a policy of strict neutrality with
regard to Russian affairs.
It was very unfortunate indeed that the Allied Nations had been
willynilly entangled in the Russian Civil War. It would have been
better if the military situation of 1 9 1 7 and 1 9 1 8 had not compelled
them to interfere. But one must not overlook the fact that the aban­
donment of intervention in Russia was tantamount to the final
failure of President Wilson's policy. The United States had entered
the war in order to make 'the world safe for democracy'. The
victory had crushed the Kaiser and substituted in Germany a
republican government for the comparatively mild and limited
imperial autocracy. On the other hand, it had resulted in Russia
in establishing a dictatorship compared with which the despotism of
the Czars could be called liberal. But the Allies were not eager to
make Russia safe for democracy as they had tried to do with Ger­
many. After all, the Kaiser's Germany had parliaments, ministers
responsible to the parliaments, trial by jury, freedom of thought, of
religion and of the press not much more limited than in the West,
558

E P I LO G U E

and many other democratic institutions. But Soviet Russia was an
unlimited despotism.
The Americans, the French and the British failed to see things from
this angle. But the anti-democratic forces in Germany, Italy, Poland,
Hungary and the Balkans thought differently. As the nationalists of
these countries interpreted it, the neutrality of the Allied Powers
with regard to Russia was evidence of the fact that their concern for
democracy had been a mere blind. The Allies, they argued, had
fought Germany because they envied Germany's economic pros­
perity and they spared the new Russian autocracy because they were
not afraid of Russian economic power. Democracy, these nationalists
concluded, was nothing else than a convenient catchword to delude
gullible people. And they became frightened that the emotional
appeal of this slogan would one day be used as a disguise for insidious
assaults against their own independence.
Since the abandonment of the intervention Russia had certainly
no longer any reason to fear the great Western powers. Neither were
the Soviets afraid of a Nazi aggression. The assertions to the
contrary, very popular in Western Europe and in America, resulted
from complete ignorance of German affairs. But the Russians knew
Germany and the Nazis. They had read Mein Kampf They learned
from this book not only that Hitler coveted the Ukraine, but also
that Hitler's fundamental strategical idea was to embark upon the
conquest of Russia only after having definitely and for ever anni­
hilated France. The Russians were fully convinced that Hitler's
expectation, as expressed in Mein KampJ, that Great Britain and the
United States would keep out of this war and would quietly let
France be destroyed, was vain. They were certain that such a new
world war, in which they themselves planned to stay neutral, would
result in a new German defeat. And this defeat, they argued, would
make Germany - if not the whole of Europe - safe for Bolshevism.
Guided by this opinion, Stalin already in the time of the Weimar
Republic aided the then secret German rearmament. The German
communists helped the Nazis as much as they could in their en­
deavours to undermine the Weimar regime. Finally Stalin entered
in August 1 939 into an open aHiance with Rider, in order to give him
a free hand against the West.
What Stalin - like all other people - did not anticipate was the
overwhelming success of the German armies in 1 940. Hitler attacked
559

E PILOGUE

Russia in 1 94 1 because he was fully convinced that not only France
but also Great Britain was done for, and that the United States,
menaced in the rear by Japan, would not be strong enough to
interfere successfully with European affairs.
The disintegration of the Hapsburg Empire in 1 9 1 8 and the Nazi
defeat in 1 945 have opened the gates of Europe to Russia. Russia is
today the only military power on the European continent. But why
are the Russians so intent upon conquering and annexing? They
certainly do not need the resources of these countries. Neither is
Stalin driven by the idea that such conquests could increase his
popularity with the Russian masses. His subjects are indifferent to
military glory.
It is not the masses whom Stalin wants to placate by his aggressive
policy, but the intellectuals. For their Marxian orthodoxy is at stake,
the very foundation of the Soviet might.
These Russian inteHectuals were narrow-minded enough to absorb
modifications of the Marxian creed which were in fact an abandon­
ment of the essential teachings of dialectical materialism, provided
that these modifications flattered their Russian chauvinism. They
swallowed the doctrine that their holy Russia could skip one of the
inextricable stages of economic evolution as described by Marx.
They prided themselves on being the vanguard of the proletariat and
the world revolution who, by realizing socialism first in one country
only, set up a glorious example for all other nations. But it is
impossible to explain to them why the other nations do not finally
catch up with Russia. In the writings of Marx and Engels, which
one cannot keep out of their hands, they discover that the fathers of
Marxism considered Great Britain and France and even Germany
as the countries most advanced in civilization and in the evolution of
capitalism. These students of the Marxian universities may be too
dull to comprehend the philosophical and economic doctrines of the
Marxian gospel. But they are not too dull to see that Marx considered
those Western countries as much more advanced than Russia.
Then some of these students of economic policies and statistics
begin to suspect that the standard of living of the masses is much
higher in the capitalist countries than in their own country. How
can this be? Why are conditions much more propitious in the United
States which - although foremost in capitalist production - is most
backward in awakening class-consciousness in the proletarians?
560

EPILOGUE

The inference from these facts seems inescapable.

If the most

advanced countries do not adopt communism and fare rather well
under capitalism, if communism is limited to a country which Marx
considered as backward and does not bring about riches for all, is
not perhaps the correct interpretation that communism is a feature
of backward countries and results in general poverty? Must not a
Russian patriot be ashamed of the fact that his country is committed
to this system?
Such thoughts are very dangerous in a despotic country. Whoever
dared to express them would be mercilessly liquidated by the
G.P.U. But,. even unspoken, they are on the tip of every intelligent
man's tongue. They trouble the sleep of the supreme officials and
perhaps even that of the great dictator. He certainly has the power
to crush every opponent. But considerations of expediency make it
inadvisable to eradicate all somewhat judicious people and to run
the country only with stupid blockheads.
This is the real crisis of Russian Marxism. Every day that passes
without bringing the world revolution aggravates it. The Soviets
must conquer the world or else they are menaced in their own coun­
try by a defection of the intelligentsia. It is concern about the
ideological state of Russia's shrewdest minds that pushes Stalin's
Russia towards unflinching aggression.

§5
Trotsky's Heresy
The dictatorial doctrine as taught by the Russian Bolshevists, the
Italian Fascists and the German Nazis tacitly implies that there
cannot arise any disagreement with regard to the question who shall
be the dictator. The mystical forces directing the course of historical
events designate the providential leader. All righteous people are
bound to submit to the unfathomable decrees of history and to bend
their knees before the throne of the man of destiny. Those who
decline to do so are heretics, abject scoundrels who must be 'liquid­
ated'.
In reality the dictatorial power is seized by that candidate who
succeeds in exterminating in time all his rivals and their helpers.
561

EPILOGUE
The dictator paves his way to supreme power by slaughtering all his
competitors. He preserves his eminent position by butchering all
those who could possibly dispute it. The history of all oriental
despotisms bears witness to this, as well as the experience of con­
temporary dictatorship.
When Lenin died in 1 924, Stalin supplanted his most dangerous
rival, Trotsky. Trotsky escaped, spent years abroad in various
countries of Europe, Asia and America and was finally assassinated
in Mexico City. Stalin remained the absolute ruler of Russia.
Trotsky was an intellectual of the orthodox Marxian type. As such
he tried to represent his personal feud with Stalin as a conflict of
principles. He tried to construct a Trotsky doctrine as distinguished
from the Stalin doctrine. He branded Stalin's policies as an apostasy
from the sacred legacy of Marx and Lenin. Stalin retorted in the
same way. In fact, hO\AleVer, the conflict ,vas a rivalry of t\VQ men,
not a conflict of antagonistic ideas and principles. There was some

minor dissent with regard to tactical methods. But in all essential
matters Stalin and Trotsky were in agreement.
Trotsky had lived, before 1 9 1 7, many years in foreign countries
and was to some degree familiar with the main languages of the
Western peoples. He posed as an expert in international affairs.
Actually he did not know anything about Western civilization,
political ideas and economic conditions. As a wandering exile he
had moved almost exclusively in the circles of his fellow-exiles. The
only foreigners whom he had met occasionally in coffee-houses and
club-rooms of Western and Central Europe were radical doctrinaires,
by their Marxian prepossessions precluded from reality. His main

reading was Marxian books and periodicals. He scorned all other
writings as 'bourgeois' literature. He was absolutely unfitted to see
events from any other angle than that of Marxism. Like Marx he
was ready to interpret every great strike and every small riot as the
sign of the outbreak of the final great revolution.
Stalin is a poorly educated Georgian. He has not the slightest
knowledge of any Western language. He does not know Europe or
America. Even his achievements as a Marxian author are question­
able. But it was precisely the fact that, although an adamant
supporter of communism, he was not indoctrinated with Marxian
dogmas that made him superior to Trotsky. Stalin was not deluded
by the spurious tenets of dialectical materialism . When faced with a
562

EPILOGUE

problem, he did not search for an interpretation in the writings of
Marx and Engels. He trusted his common sense. He was judicious
enough to discern the fact that the policy of world revolution as
inaugurated by Lenin and Trotsky in 1 9 1 7 had failed completely
outside the borders of Russia.
In Germany the communists, led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa
Luxemburg, were crushed by detachments of the regular army and
by nationalist volunteers in a bloody battle fought in January 1 9 1 9
in the streets of Berlin. The communist seizure of power i n Munich
in spring 1 9 1 9 and the Holz riot in March 1 92 1 ended likewise in
disaster. In Hungary, in 1 9 1 9, the communists were defeated by
Horthy and G6mb6s and the Rumanian army. In Austria various
communist plots failed in 1 9 1 8 and 1 9 1 9 ; a violent upheaval in
July 1 92 7 was easily quelled by the Vienna police. In Italy, in
1 920, the occupation of the factories was a complete miscarriage. I n
France and i n S¥,itzerland the commurJst propaganda seemed to
be very powerful in the first years following the Armistice of 1 9 1 8 ;
but i t evaporated very soon. I n Great Britain, in 1 926, the general
strike called by the labour unions resulted in lamentable failure.
Trotsky was so blinded by his orthodoxy that he refused to admit
that the Bolshevist methods had failed. But Stalin realized it very
well. He did not abandon the idea of instigating revolutionary out­
breaks in all foreign countries and of conquering the whole world
for the Soviets. But he was fully aware of the fact that it was neces­
sary to postpone the aggression for a few years and to resort to new
methods for its execution. Trotsky was wrong in accusing Stalin of
strangling the communist movement outside of Russia. What
Stalin really did was to apply other means for the attainment of ends
which are common to him and all other Marxians.
As an exegetic of Marxian dogmas Stalin was certainly inferior to
Trotsky. But he surpassed his rival by far as a politician. Bolshevism
owes its successes in world policies to Stalin, not to Trotsky.
In the field of domestic policies, Trotsky resorted to the well­
tried traditional tricks which Marxians had always applied in
criticizing socialist measures adopted by other parties. Whatever
Stalin did was not true socialism and communism, but, on the
contrary, the very opposite of it, a monstrous perversion of the lofty
principles of Marx and Lenin. All the disastrous features of public
control of production and distribution as they appeared in Russia
563

EPILOGUE

were, in Trotsky's interpretation, brought about by Stalin's policies.
They were not unavoidable consequences of communist methods.
They were attendant phenomena of Stalinism, not of communism.
It was exclusively Stalin's fault that an absolutist irresponsible
bureaucracy was supreme, that a class of privileged oligarchs enjoyed
luxuries while the masses lived on the verge of starvation, that a
terrorist regime executed the old guard of revolutionaries and con­
demned millions to slave labour in concentration camps, that the
secret police was omnipotent, that the labour unions were powerless,
that the masses were deprived of all rights and liberties. Stalin was
not a champion of the egalitarian classless society. He was the
pioneer of a return to the worst methods of class rule and exploita­
tion. A new ruling class of about 1 0 per cent of the population
ruthlessly oppressed and exploited the immense majority of toiling
proletarians.
Trotsky was at a loss to explain how all this could be achieved by
only one man and his few sycophants. Where were the 'material
productive forces', much talked about in Marxian historical material­
ism, which - 'independent of the wills of individuals' - determine
the course of human events 'with the inexorability of a law of nature'?
How could it happen that one man was in a position to alter the
'juridical and political superstructure' which is uniquely and in­
alterably fixed by the economic structure of society? Even Trotsky
agreed that there was no longer any private ownership of the means
of production in Russia. I n Stalin's empire, production and distribu­
tion are entirely controlled by 'society'. It is a fundamental dogma
of Marxism that the superstructure of such a system must necessarily
be the bliss of the earthly paradise. There is in Marxian doctrines no
room for an interpretation blaming individuals for a degenerative
process which could convert the blessing of public control of business
into evil. A consistent Marxian - if consistency were compatible
with Marxism - would have to admit that Stalin's political system
was the necessary superstructure of communism.
All essential items in Trotsky's programme were in perfect agree­
ment with the policies of Stalin. Trotsky advocated the industrializa­
tion of Russia. It was this that Stalin's Five-Year Plans aimed at.
Trotsky advocated the collectivization of agriculture. Stalin estab­
lished the Kolkhoz and liquidated the Kulaks. Trotsky favoured the
organization of a big army. Stalin organized such an army. Neither

was Trotsky when still in power a friend of democracy. He was, on
the contrary, a fanatical supporter of dictatorial oppression of all
'saboteurs' . It is true, he did not anticipate that the dictator could
consider him, Trotsky, author of Marxian tracts and veteran of the
glorious extermination of the Romanovs, as the most wicked sabo­
teur. Like all other advocates of dictatorship, he assumed that he
himself or one of his intimate friends would be the dictator.
Trotsky was a critic of bureaucratism. But he did not suggest any
other method for the conduct of affairs in a socialist system. There
is no other alternative to profit-seeking private business than bureau­
cratic management.\
The truth is that Trotsky found only one fault with Stalin: that he,
Stalin, was the dictator and not himself, Trotsky. In their feud they
both were right. Stalin was right in maintaining that his regime was
the embodiment of socialist principles. Trotsky was right in asserting
that Stalin's regime had made Russia a heii.
Trotskyism did not entirely disappear with Trotsky's death.
Boulangerism in France, too, survived for some time the end of
General Boulanger. There are still Carlists left in Spain although the
line of Don Carlos died out. Such posthumous movements are, of
course, doomed.
But in all countries there are people who, although themselves
fanatically committed to the idea of all-round planning, i.e. public
ownership of the means of production, become frightened when they
are confronted with the real face of communism. These people are
disappointed. They dream of a Garden of Eden. For them commun.;.
ism, or socialism, means an easy life in riches and the full enjoyment
of all liberties and pleasures. They fail to realize the contradictions
inherent in their image of the communist society. They have un­
critically swallowed all the lunatic fantasies of Charles Fourier and
all the absurdities ofVeblen. They firmly believe in Engels's assertion
that socialism will be a realm of unlimited freedom. They indict
capitalism for everything they dislike, and are fully convinced that
socialism will deliver them from all evil. They ascribe their own
failures and frustrations to the unfairness of this 'mad' competitive
system and expect that sociaiism win assign them that eminent posi­
tion and high income which by right are due to them. They are

merits and virtues. The loathing of capitalism and the worship of
communism are consolations for them. They help them to disguise
to themselves their own inferiority, and to blame the 'system' for
their own shortcomings.
I n advocating dictatorship such people always advocate the
dictatorship of their own clique. In asking for planning, what they
have in mind is always their own plan, not that of others. They will
never admit that a socialist or communist regime is true and genuine
socialism or communism, if it does not assign to themselves the most
eminent position and the highest income. For them the essential
feature of true and genuine communism is that all affairs are pre­
cisely conducted according to their own will, and that all those who
disagree are beaten into submission.
It is a fact that the majority of our contemporaries are imbued
with socialist and communist ideas. However, this does not mean
that they are unanimous in their proposals for socialization of the
means of production and public control of production and distribu­
tion. On the contrary. Each socialist coterie is fanatically opposed
to the plans of all other socialist groups. The various socialist sects
fight one another most bitterly.
If the case of Trotsky and the analogous case of Gregor Strasser
in Nazi Germany were isolated cases, there would be no need to
deal with them. But they are not casual incidents. They are typical.
Study of them reveals the psychological causes both of the popularity
of socialism and of its unfeasibility.

The Liberation of the Demons
The history of mankind is the history of ideas. For it is ideas,
theories and doctrines that guide human action, determine the
ultimate ends men aim at, and the choice of the means employed for
the attainment of these ends. The sensational events which stir the
emotions and catch the interest of superficial observers are merely
the 'Consummation of ideological changes. There are no such things
as abrupt sweeping transformations of human affairs. What is called,
in rather misleading terms, a 'turning point in history' is the coming
on the scene of forces which were already for a long time at work
566

EPILOGUE
behind the scene. New ideologies, which had already long since
superseded the old ones, throw off their last veil and even the dullest
people become aware of the changes which they did not notice before.

In this sense Lenin's seizure of power in October 1 9 1 7 was
certainly a turning point. But its meaning was very different from
that which the communists attribute to it.
The Soviet victory played only a minor role in the evolution
towards socialism. The pro-socialist policies of the industrial coun­
tries of Central and Western Europe were of much greater conse­
quence in this regard. Bismarck's social security scheme was a more
momentous pioneering on the way towards socialism than was the
expropriation of the backward Russian manufactures. The Prussian
National Railways had provided the only instance of a government­
operated business which, for some time at least, had avoided mani­
fest fi nancial failure. The British had already before 1 9 1 4 adopted
essential parts of the German social security system. In all industrial
countries, the governments were committed to interventionist
policies which were bound to result ultimately in socialism. During
the war most of them embarked upon what was called war socialism.
The German Hindenburg Programme which, of course, could not
be executed completely on account of Germany's defeat, was no less
radical but much better designed than the much talked-about
Russian Five-Year Plans.
For the socialists in the predominantly industrial countries of the
West, the Russian methods could not be of any use. For these
countries, production of manufactures for export was indispensable.
They could not adopt the Russian system of economic autarky.
Russia had never exported manufactures in quantities worth men­
tioning. Under the Soviet system it withdrew almost entirely from
the world market of cereals and raw materials. Even fanatical
socialists could not help admitting that the West could not learn
anything from Russia. It is obvious that the technological achieve­
ments in which the Bolshevist gloried were merely clumsy imitations
of things accomplished in the West. Lenin defined communism as:
' the Soviet pOWer plus electrification'. Now, electrification was
certainly not of Russian origin, and the Western nations surpass
Russia in the field of electrification no less than in every other
branch of industry.
The real significance of the Lenin revolution is to be seen in the

567

EPILOGUE

fact that it was the bursting forth of the principle of unrestricted
violence and oppression. I t was the negation of all the political
ideals that had for three thousand years guided the evolution of
Western civilization.
State and government are the social apparatus of violent coercion
and repression. Such an apparatus, the police power, is indispens­
able in order to prevent anti-social individuals and bands from
destroying social co-operation. Violent prevention and suppression
of anti-social activities benefit the whole of society and each of its
members. But violence and oppression are none the less evils and
corrupt those in charge of their application. It is necessary to
restrict the power of those in office lest they become absolute
despots. Society cannot exist without an apparatus of violent coer­
cion. But neither can it exist if the office holders are irresponsible
tyrants free to inflict harm upon those they dislike.
It is the social function of the laws to curb the arbitrariness of
the police. The rule of law restricts the arbitrariness of the officers
I t strictly limits their discretion, and thus
assigns to the citizens a sphere in which they are free to act without
as much as possible.

being frustrated by government interference.
Freedom and liberty always mean freedom from police inter­
ference. In nature there are no such things as liberty and freedom.
There is only the adamant rigidity of the laws of nature to which
m an must unconditionally submit if he wants to attain any ends at

all. Neither was there liberty in the imaginary paradisaical condi­
tions which, according to the fantastic prattle of many writers, pre­
ceded the establishment of societal bonds. Where there is no govern­
ment, everybody is at the mercy of his stronger neighbour. Liberty
can be realized only within an established state ready to prevent a

gangster from killing and robbing his weaker fellows. But it is the

rule of law alone which hinders the rulers from turning themselves
into the worst gangsters.
The laws establish norms of legitimate action. They fix the pro­
cedures required for the repeal or alteration of existing laws and for
the enactment of new laws. They likewise fix the procedures required
for the application of the laws in definite cases, the due process of
law. They establish courts and tribunals. Thus they are intent upon
avoiding a situation in which the individuals are at the mercy of
the rulers.
568

EPILOGUE
Mortal men are liable to error, and legislators and judges are
mortal men. It may happen again and again that the valid laws or
their interpretation by the courts prevent the executive organs from
resorting to some measures which could be beneficial. No great
harm, however, can result. If the legislators recognize the deficiency
ofthe valid laws, they can alter them. It is certainly a bad thing that
a criminal may sometimes evade punishment because there is a
loophole left in the law, or because the prosecutor has neglected
some formalities. But it is the minor evil when compared with the
consequences of unlimited discretionary power on the part of the
'benevolent' despot.
It is precisely this point which anti-social individuals fail to see.
Such people condemn the formalism of the due process of law. Why
should the laws hinder the government from resorting to beneficial
measures? Is it not fetishism to make the laws supreme and not
expediency? They advocate the substitution of the welfare state
for the state governed by the rule of law (Rechts­
In this welfare state, paternal government should be free to

accomplish all things it considers beneficial to the commonweal. No
'scraps of paper' should restrain an enlightened ruler in his en­
deavours to promote the general welfare. All opponents must be
crushed mercilessly lest they frustrate the beneficial action of the
government. No empty formalities must protect them any longer
against their well-deserved punishment.
I t is customary to call the point of view of the advocates of the
welfare state the 'social' point of view as distinguished from the
'individualistic' and 'selfish' point of view of the champions of
the rule of law. In fact, however, the supporters of the welfare state
are utterly anti-social and intolerant zealots. For their ideology
tacitly implies that the government will exactly execute what they
themselves deem right and beneficial. They entirely disregard the
possibility that there could arise disagreement with regard to the
question of what is right and expedient and what is not. They
advocate enlightened despotism, but they are convinced that the
enlightened despot ,,,,ill in every detail comply \Alith their own opinion
concerning the measures to be adopted. They favour planning, but
what they have in mind is exclusively their own plan, not those of
other people. They want to exterminate all opponents, that is, all
those who disagree with them. They are utterly intolerant and are

569

EPILOGUE
not prepared to allow any dissension. Every advocate of the welfare
state and of planning is a potential dictator. What he plans is to
deprive all other men of all their rights, and to establish his own and
his friends' unrestricted omnipotence. He refuses to convince his
fellow-citizens. He prefers to 'liquidate' them. He scorns the
'bourgeois' society that worships law and legal procedure. He
himself worships violence and bloodshed.
The irreconcilable conflict of these two doctrines, rule of law
versus welfare state, was at issue in all the struggles which men
fought for liberty. It was a long and hard evolution. Again and
again the champions of absolutism triumphed. But finally the rule
of law predominated in the realm of Western civilization. The rule
of law, or limited government, as safeguarded by constitutions and
bills of rights, is the characteristic mark of this civilization. It was
the rule of law that brought about the marvellous achievements of
modern capitalism and of its - as consistent Marxians should say 'superstructure', democracy. It secured for a steadily increasing
population unprecedented well-being. The masses in the capitalist
countries enjoy today a standard of living far above that of the well­
to-do of earlier ages.

All these accomplishments have not restrained the advocates of
despotism and planning. However, it would h ave been preposterous

for the champions of totalitarianism to disclose the inextricable
dictatorial consequences of their endeavours openly . In the nine­
teenth century the ideas of liberty and the rule oflaw had won such a
prestige that it seemed crazy to attack them frankly. Public opinion
was firmly convinced that despotism was done for and could never
be restored. Was not even the Czar of barbarian Russia forced to
abolish serfdom, to establish trial by jury, to grant a limited freedom
to the press and to respect the laws?
Thus the socialists resorted to a trick. They continued to discuss
the coming dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e. the dictatorship of
each socialist author's own ideas, in their esoteric circles. But to the
broad public they spoke in a different way. Socialism, they asserted,
will bring true and full liberty and democracy. It will remove all
kinds of comDulsion and coercion. The state will 'wither awav' . In

j g�

�

the socialist ommonwealth of the future there will be neither ud
and policemen nor prisons and gallows.
But the Bolshevists took off the mask. They were fully convinced

570

EPILOGUE
that the day of their final and unshakable victory had dawned.
Further dissimulation was neither possible nor required. The gospel
of bloodshed could be preached openly. It found an enthusiastic
response among all the degenerate literati and parlour intellectuals
who for many years already had raved about the writings of Sorel
and Nietzsche. The fruits of the 'treason of the intellectuals'l
mellowed to maturity. The youths who had been fed on the ideas
of Carlyle and Ruskin were ready to seize the reins.
Lenin was not the first usurper. Many tyrants had preceded him.
But his predecessors were in conflict with the ideas held by their
most eminent contemporaries. They were opposed by public
opinion because their principles of government were at variance
with the accepted principles of right and legality. They were scorned
and detested as usurpers. But Lenin's usurpation was seen in a
different light. He was the brutal superman for whose coming the
pseudo-philosophers had yearned. He was the counterfeit saviour
whom history had elected to bring salvation through bloodshed.
Was he not the most orthodox adept of Marxian 'scientific' socialism?
Was he not the man destined to realize the socialist plans for whose
execution the weak statesmen of the decaying democracies were too
timid?
All well-intentioned people asked for socialism ; science,
through the mouths of the infallible professors, recommended it; the
churches preached Christian socialism ; the workers longed for the
abolition of the wage system. Here was the man to fulfil all these
wishes. He was judicious enough to know that you cannot make an
omelet without breaking eggs.
Half a century ago all civilized people had censured Bismarck
when he declared that history's great problems must be �olved by
blood and iron. Now the majority of quasi-civilized men bowed to
the dictator who was prepared to shed much more blood than
Bismarck ever did.
This was the true meaning of the Lenin revolution. All the tradi­
tional ideas of right and legality were overthrown. The rule of un­
restrained violence and usurpation was substituted for the rule of·

likes, repressed by a long and wearisome evolution, burst forth. The
demons were unfettered. A new age, the age of the usurpers, dawned.
The gangsters were called to action, and they listened to the Voice.
Of course, Lenin did not mean this. He did not want to concede
to other people the prerogatives which he claimed for himself. He
did not want to assign to other men the privilege of liquidating their
adversaries. Him alone had history elected and entrusted with the
dictatorial power. He was the only 'legitimate' dictator because ­
an inner voice had told him so. Lenin was not bright enough to
anticipate that other people, imbued with other creeds, could be
bold enough to pretend that they also were called by an inner voice.
Yet, within a few years two such men, Mussolini and Hitler, became
quite conspicuous.
I t is important to realize that Fascism and Nazism were socialist
dictatorships. The communists, both the registered members of the
communist parties and the fellow-travellers, stigmatize Fascism and
Nazism as the highest and last and most depraved stage of capitalism.
This is in perfect agreement with their habit of calling every party
which does not unconditionally surrender to the dictates of Moscow
- even the German Social Democrats, the classical party of Marx­
ism - hirelings of capitalism.
It is of much greater consequence that the communists have suc­
ceeded in changing the semantic connotation of the term Fascism.
Fascism, as will be shown later, was a variety of Italian socialism.
It was adjusted to the particular conditions of the masses in over­
populated Italy. I t was not a product of Mussolini's mind and will
survive the fall of Mussolini. The foreign policies of Fascism and
Nazism, from their early beginnings, were rather opposed to one
another. The fact that the Nazis and the Fascists closely co-operated
after the Ethiopian war, and were allies in the second World War,
did not eradicate the differences between these two tenets any more
than did the alliance between Russia and the United States eradicate
the differences between Sovietism and the American economic
system. Fascism and Nazism were both committed to the Soviet
principle of dictatorship and violent oppression of dissenters. If one
wants to assign Fascism and Nazism to the same class of political
systems, one must call this class dictatorial regime and one must not
neglect to assign the Soviets to the same class.
In recent years the communists' semantic innovations have gone
572

EPILOGUE

even further. They call everybody whom they dislike, every advo­
cate of the free enterprise system, a Fascist. Bolshevism, they say,
is the only really democratic system. All non-communist countries
and parties are essentially undemocratic and Fascist.
It is true that sometimes also non-socialists - the last vestiges of
the old aristocracy - toyed with the idea of an aristocratic revolution
modelled according to the pattern of Soviet dictatorship. Lenin had
opened their eyes. What dupes, they moaned, have we been ! We
have let ourselves be deluded by the spurious catchwords of the
liberal bourgeoisie. We believed that it was not permissible to deviate
from the rule of law and to crush mercilessly those challenging our
rights. How silly were these Romanovs in granting to their deadly
foes the benefits of a fair legal trial! If somebody arouses the suspicion
of Lenin, he is done for. Lenin does not hesitate to exterminate,
without any trial, not only every suspect, but all his kin and friends
too. But the Czars were superstitiously afraid of infringing the rules
established by those scraps of paper called laws. When Alexander
Ulyanov conspired against the Czar's life, he alone was executed ; his
brother Vladimir was spared. Thus Alexander I I I himself preserved
the life of Ulyanov-Lenin, the man who ruthlessly exterminated his
son, his daughter-in-law and their children and with them all the
other members of the family he could catch. Was this not the most
stupid and suicidal policy?
However, no action could result from the day dreams of these old
Tories. They were a small group of powerless grumblers. They were
not backed by any ideological forces and they had no followers.
The idea of such an aristocratic revolution motivated the German
Stahlhelm and the French Cagoulards. The Stahlhelm was simply
dispelled by order of Hitler. The French Government could easily
imprison the Cagoulards before they had any opportunity to do harm.
The nearest approach to an aristocratic dictatorship is Franco's
regime. But Franco was merely a puppet of Mussolini and Hitler,
who wanted to secure Spanish aid for the impending war against
France or at least Spanish 'friendly' neutrality. With his protectors
gone, he will either have to adopt Western methods of government
or face removaL
Dictatorship and violent oppression of all dissenters are today
exclusively socialist institutions. This becomes clear as we take a
closer look at Fascism and Nazism.

Fascism
When the war broke out in 1914, the Italian socialist party was
divided as to the policy to be adopted.
One group clung to the rigid principles of Marxism. This war,
they maintained, is a war of the capitalists. It is not seemly for the
proletarians to side with any of the belligerent parties. The prole­
tarians must wait for the great revolution, the civil war of the united
socialists against the united exploiters. They must stand for Italian
neutrality.
The second group was deeply affected by the traditional hatred
of Austria. In their opinion the first task of the Italians was to free
their unredeemed brethren. Only then would the day of the socialist
revoiution appear.
In this conflict Benito Mussolini, the outstanding man in Italian
socialism, chose at first the orthodox Marxian position. Nobody
could surpass Mussolini in Marxian zeal. He was the intransigent
champion of the pure creed, the unyielding defender of the rights
of the exploited proletarians, the eloquent prophet of the socialist
bliss to come. He was an adamant adversary of patriotism, national­
ism, imperialism, monarchical rule and all religious creeds. When
Italy in 191 1 opened the great series of wars by an insidious assault
upon Turkey, Mussolini organized violent demonstrations against
the departure of troops for Libya. Now, in 191 4, he branded the
war against Germany and Austria as an imperialist war. He was
then still under the dominating influence of Angelica Balabanoff,
the daughter of a wealthy Russian landowner. Miss Balabanoff had
initiated him into the subtleties of Marxism. In her eyes the defeat
of the Romanovs counted more than the defeat of the Habsburgs.
She had no sympathy for the ideals of the Risorgimento.
But the Italian intellectuals were first of all nationalists. As in all
other European countrie!>, most of the Marxians longed for war and
conquest. Mussolini was not prepared to lose his popularity. The
thing he hated most was not to be on the side of the victorious
faction. He changed his mind and became the most fanatical advo­
cate of Italy'S attack on Austria. With French financial aid he
founded a newspaper to fight for the cause of the war.
574

EPILOGUE

The anti-Fascists blame Mussolini for this defection from the
teachings of rigid Marxism. He was bribed, they say, by the French.
Now, even these people should know that the publication of a
newspaper requires funds. They themselves do not speak of bribery
if a wealthy American provides a man with the money needed for
the publication of a fellow-traveller newspaper, or if funds mysteri­
ously flow into the communist publishing firms. It is a fact that
Mussolini entered the scene of world politicis as an ally of the
democracies, while Lenin entered it as a virtual ally of imperial
Germany.
More than anybody else Mussolini was instrumental in achieving
Italy's entry into the first World War. His journalistic propaganda
made it possible for the government to declare war on Austria.
Only those few people have a right to nnd fault with his attitude
in the years 1 9 1 4 to 1 9 1 8 who realize that the disintegration of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire spelled the doom of Europe. Oniy those
Italians are free to blame Mussolini who begin to understand that
the only me....1S of protecting the Italian-speaking minorities in the
littoral districts of Austria against the threatening annihilation by the
Slavonic majorities was to preserve the integrity of the Austrian state,
whose constitution guaranteed equal rights to all linguistic groups.
Mussolini was one of the most wretched figures of history. But the
fact remains that his first great political deed still meets with the
approval of all his countrymen and of the immense majority of his
foreign detractors.
When the war came to an end, Mussolini's popularity dwindled.
The communists, swept into popularity by events in Russia, carried
on. But the great communist venture, the occupation of the factories
in 1 920, ended in complete failure, and the disappointed masses
remembered the former leader of the socialist party. They flocked
to Mussolini's new party, the Fascists. The youth greeted with tur­
bulent enthusiasm the self-styled successor of the Caesars. Mussolini
boasted in later years that he had saved Italy from the danger of
communism. His foes passionately dispute his claims. Communism,
they say, was no longer a real factor in Italy when Mussolini seized
power. The truth is that the frustration of communism swelled the
ranks of the Fascists and made it possible for them to destroy all
other parties. The overwhelming victory of the Fascists was not the
cause, but the consequence, of the communist fiasco.
575

EPILOGUE
The programme of the Fascists, as drafted in 1 9 19, was vehemently
anti-capitalistic. 1 The most radical New Dealers and even com­
munists could agree with it. When the Fascists came to power, they
had forgotten those points of their programme which referred to the
liberty of thought and the press and the right of assembly. In this
respect they were conscientious disciples of Bukharin and Lenin.
Moreover they did not suppress, as they had promised, the industrial
and financial corporations. Italy badly needed foreign credits for
the development of its industries. The main problem for Fascism,
in the first years of its rule, was to win the confidence of the foreign
bankers. It would have been suicidal to destroy the Italian cor­
porations.
Fascist economic policy did not - at the beginning - essentially
differ from those of all other Western nations. It was a policy of
interventionism. As the years went on, it more and more approached
the Nazi pattern of socialism. When Italy, after the defeat of France,
entered the second World War, its economy was by and large
already shaped according to the Nazi pattern. The main difference
was that the Fascists were less efficient and even more corrupt than
the Nazis.
But Mussolini could not long remain without an economic philo­
sophy of his own invention. Fascism posed as a new philosophy,
unheard of before and unknown to all other nations. It claimed to
be the gospel which the resurrected spirit of ancient Rome brought
to the decaying democratic peoples whose barbarian ancestors had
once destroyed the Roman empire. It was the consummation both
of the Rinascimento and the Risorgimento in every respect, the final
liberation of the Latin genius from the yoke of foreign ideologies.
Its shining leader, the peerless Duce, was called to find the ultimate
solution for the burning problems of society's economic organization
and of social justice.
From the dust-heap of discarded socialist utopias, the Fascist
scholars salvaged the scheme of guild socialism. Guild socialism was
very popular with British socialists in the last years of the first World
War and in the first years following the Armistice. It was so imprac­
ticable that it disappeared very soon from socialist literature. No
serious statesman ever paid any attention to the contradictory and

EPI LOGU E
confused plans of guild socialism. It was almost forgotten when the
Fascists attached to it a new label, and flamboyantly proclaimed
corporativism as the new social panacea. The public inside and out­
side of Italy was captivated. Innumerable books, pamphlets and
articles were written in praise of the stato corporativo. The govern­
ments of Austria and Portugal very soon declared that they were
committed to the noble principles of corporativism. The papal
encyclical Q,uadragesimo Anno ( 1 93 I ) contained some paragraphs
which could be interpreted - but need not be - as an approval of
corporativism. In France its ideas found many eloquent supporters.
It was mere idle talk. Never did the Fascists make any attempt to
realize the corporativist programme, industrial self-government.
They changed the name of the chambers of commerce into corpora­
tive councils. They called corporazione the compulsory organizations
of the various branches of industry which were the administrative
units for the execution of the German pattern of socialism they had
adopted. But there was no question of the corporazione's self-govern­
ment. The Fascist cabinet did not tolerate anybody's interference
with its absolute authoritarian control of production. All the plans
for the establishment of the corporative system remained a dead
letter.
Italy's main problem is its comparative overpopulation. In this
age of barriers to trade and migration, the Italians are condemned
to subsist permanently on a lower standard of living than that of
the inhabitants of the countries more favoured by nature. The
Fascists saw only one means to remedy this unfortunate situation :
conquest. They were too narrow-minded to comprehend that the
redress they recommended was spurious and worse than the evil.
They were moreover so entirely blinded by self-conceit and vain­
glory that they failed to realize that their provocative speeches were
simply ridiculous. The foreigners whom they insolently challenged
knew very well how negligible Italy's military forces were.
Fascism was not, as its advocates boasted, an original product of
the I talian mind. It began with a split in the ranks of Marxian
socialism, which certainly was an imported doctrine. Its economic
programme was borrowed from German non-l'vfarAian socialism and
its aggressiveness was likewise copied from Germans, the All-deutscke
or Pan-German forerunners of the Nazis. Its conduct of government
affairs was a replica of Lenin's dictatorship. Corporativism, its much
577

E P I LO G U E

advertised ideological adornment, was of British origin. The only
home-grown ingredient of Fascism was the theatrical style of its
processions, shows and festivals.
The shortlived Fascist episode ended in blood, misery and igno­
miny. But the forces which generated Fascism are not dead. Fana­
tical nationalism is a feature common to all present-day Italians.
The communists are certainly not prepared to renounce their
principle of dictatorial oppression of all dissenters. Neither do the
Catholic parties advocate freedom of thought, of the press or cif
religion. There are in Italy only very few people indeed who com­
prehend that the indispensable prerequisite of democracy and the
rights of men is economic freedom.
I t may happen that Fascism will be resurrected under a new label
and with new slogans and symbols. But if this happens, the conse­
quences will be detrimental. For Fascism is not as the Fascists
trumpeted a 'new way to life' ;1 it is a rather old way towards
destruction and death.

§8
Nazism
The philosophy of the Nazis, the German National Socialist Labour
is the purest and most consistent manifestation of the anti­
capitalistic and socialistic spirit of our age. Its essential ideas are
not German or 'Aryan' in origin, nor are they peculiar to the present­
day Germans. In the genealogical tree of the Nazi doctrine such
Latins as Sismondi and Georges Sorel, and such Anglo-Saxons as
Carlyle, Ruskin and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, were more
conspicuous than any German. Even the best known ideological
attire of Nazism, the fable of the superiority of the Aryan master
race, was not of German provenance; its author was a Frenchman,
Gobineau. Germans of Jewish descent, like Lassalle, Lasson, Stahl
and WaIter Rathenau, contributed more to the essential tenets of
Nazism than such men as Sombart, Spann and Ferdinand Fried.
The slogan into which the Nazis condensed their economic philo­
sophy, viz., Gemeinnutz geht vor Eigennutz (i.e., the commonweal ranks

above private profit) , is likewise the idea underlying the American
New Deal and the Soviet managem�nt of economic affairs. It implies
that profit-seeking business harms the vital interests of the immense
majority, and that it is the sacred duty of popular government
to prevent the emergence of profits by public control of production
and distribution.
The only specifically German ingredient in Nazism was its striving
after the conquest of Lebensraum. And this, too, was an outcome of
their agreement with the ideas guiding the policies of the most influ­
ential political parties of all other countries. These parties proclaim
income equality as the main thing. The Nazis do the same. What
characterizes the Nazis is the fact that they are not prepared to
acquiesce in a state of affairs in which the Germans are doomed for
ever to be 'imprisoned', as they say, in a comparatively small and
overpopulated area in which the productivity of labour must be
smaner than in the comparatively underpopuiated countries, which
are better endowed with natural resources and capital. They aim at
a fairer distribution of the earth's natural resources. As a 'have-not'
nation they look at the wealth of the richer nations with the same
feelings with which many people in the Western countries look at
the higher incomes of some of their countrymen. The 'progressives'
in the Anglo-Saxon countries assert that 'liberty is not worth having'
for those who are wronged by the comparative smallness of their
incomes. The Nazis say the same with regard to international
relations. In their opinion the only freedom that matters is Nahrungs­
freiheit (viz., freedom from importing food) . They aim at the acquisi­
tion of a territory so large and rich in natural resources that they
could live in economic self-sufficiency at a standard not lower than
that of any other nation. They consider themselves as revolu­
tionaries fighting for their inalienable natural rights against the
vested interests of a host of reactionary nations.
It is easy for economists to explode the fallacies involved in the
Nazi doctrines. But those who disparage economics as 'orthodox and
reactionary', and fanatically support the spurious creeds of socialism
and economic nationalism, were at a loss to refute them. For
Nazism was nothing but the logical application of their own tenets
to the particular conditions of comparatively overpopulated Ger­
many.
For more than seventy years the German professors of political
579

EPILOGUE
science, history, law, geography and philosophy eagerly imbued
their disciples with a hysterical hatred of capitalism, and preached
the war of 'liberation' against the capitalistic West. The German
'socialists of the chair' , much admired in all foreign countries, were
the pacemakers of the two World Wars. At the turn of the century
the immense majority of the Germans were already radical sup­
porters of socialism and aggressive nationalism. They were then
already firmly committed to the principles of Nazism . What was
lacking and was added later was only a new term to signify their
doctrine.
When the Soviet policies of mass extermination of all dissenters
and of ruthless violence removed the inhibitions against wholesale
murder, which still troubled some of the Germans, nothing could
any longer stop the advance of Nazism. The Nazis were quick to
adopt the Soviet methods. They imported from Russia: the one­
p arty system and the pre-eminence of this party in political life; the
paramount position assigned to the secret police; the concentration
camps ; the administrative execution or imprisonment of all oppo­
nents; the extermination of the families of suspects and of exiles; the
methods of propaganda; the organization of affiliated parties abroad
and their employment for fighting their domestic governments and
for espionage and sabotage; the use of the diplomatic and consular
service for fomenting revolution; and many other things besides.
There were nowhere more docile disciples of Lenin, Trotsky and
Stalin than the Nazis were.
Hitler was not the founder of Nazism; he was its product. He was,
like most of his collaborators, a sadistic gangster. He was un­
educated and ignorant; he had failed even in the lower grades of
high school. He never had any honest job. It is a fable that he
had ever been a paperhanger. His military career in the first World
War was rather mediocre. The First Class Iron Cross was given to
him after the end of the war as a reward for his activities as a political
agent. He was a maniac obsessed by megalomania. But learned
professors nourished his self-conceit. Werner Sombart, who once
had boasted that his life was devoted to the task of fighting for the

ideas of Marx,l Sombart, whom the American Economic Association
had elected to Honorary Membership and many non-German
universities to honorary degrees, candidly declared that Fuhrertum
I

EPILOGUE

means a permanent revelation and that the Fahrer receives his orders
directly from God, the supreme Fiihrer of the Universe.1
The Nazi plan was more comprehensive and therefore more per­
nicious than that of the Marxians. It aimed at abolishing laisser-faire
not only in the production of material goods, but no less in the pro­
duction of men. The Fuhrer was not only the general manager of
all industries; he was also the general manager of the breeding-farm
intent upon rearing superior men and eliminating inferior stock. A
grandiose scheme of eugenics was to be put into effect according to
'scientific' principles.
It is vain for the champions of eugenics to protest that they did
not mean what the Nazis executed. Eugenics aims at placing some
men, backed by the police power, in complete control of human
reproduction. It suggests that the methods applied to domestic
animals be applied to men. This is precisely what the Nazis tried
to do. The only objection which a consistent eugenist can raise is
that his own plan differs from that of the Nazi scholars and that he
wants to rear another type of men than the Nazis. As every sup­
porter of economic planning aims at the execution of his own plan
only, so every advocate of eugenic planning aims at the execution
of his own plan and wants himself to act as the breeder of human
stock.
The eugenists pretend that they want to eliminate criminal indi­
viduals. But the qualification of a man as a criminal depends upon
the prevailing laws of the country and varies with the change in
social and political ideologies. John Huss, Giordano Bruno and
Galileo Galilei were criminals from the point of view of the laws
which their judges applied. When Stalin robbed the Russian State
Bank of several million rubles, he committed a crime. Today it is
an offence in Russia to disagree with Stalin. In Nazi Germany
sexual intercourse between 'Aryans' and the members of an 'inferior'
race was a crime. Whom do the eugenists want to eliminate, Brutus
or Caesar? Both violated the laws of their country. If eighteenth­
century eugenists had prevented alcohol addicts from generating
children, their planning would have eliminated Beethoven.
It must be emphasized again : there is no such thing as a scientific
ought. Which men are superior and which are inferior can only be

University Press 1937), p. 1 94.

decided by personal value judgments not liable to verification or
falsification. The eugenists delude themselves in assuming that they
themselves will be called to decide what qualities are to be conserved
in the human stock. They are too dull to take into account the
possibility that other people might make the choice according to
their own value judgments.1 In the eyes of the Nazis the brutal
killer, the 'fair-haired beast', is the most perfect specimen of mankind.
The mass slaughters perpetrated in the Nazi horror camps are too
horrible to be adequately described by words. But: they were the
logical and consistent application of doctrines and policies parading
as applied science and approved by some men who in a sector of the
natural sciences have displayed acumen and technical skill in
laboratory research.

§9
The Teachings of Soviet Experience
Many people all over the world assert that the Soviet 'experiment'
has supplied conclusive evidence in favour of socialism and disproved
all, or at least most, of the objections raised against it. The facts,
they say, speak for themselves. It is no longer permissible to pay any
attention to the spurious aprioristic reasoning of armchair economists
criticizing the socialist plans. A crucial experiment has exploded
their fallacies.
It is, first of all, necessary to comprehend that in the field of pur­
posive human action and social relations no experiments can be
made and no experiments have ever been made. The experimental
method to which the natural sciences owe all their achievements is
inapplicable in the social sciences. The natural sciences are in a
position to observe in the laboratory experiment the consequences of
the isolated change in one element only, while other elements remain
unchanged. Their experimental observation refers ultimately to
certain isolable elements in sense experience. What the natural
sciences call facts are the causal relations shown in such experiments.
Their theories and hypotheses must be in agreement with these
facts.

But the experience with which the sciences of human action have
to deal is essentially different. It is historical experience. It is an
experience of complex phenomena, of the joint effects brought about
by the co-operation of a multiplicity of elements. The social sciences
are never in a position to control the conditions of change and to
isolate them from one another in the way in which the experimenter
proceeds in arranging his experiments. They never enjoy the advan­
tage of observing the consequences of a change in one element only,
other conditions being equal. They are never faced with facts in the
sense in which the natural sciences employ this term. Every fact
and every experience with which the social sciences have to deal is
open to various interpretations. Historical facts and historical ex­
perience can never prove or disprove a statement in the way in
which an experiment proves or disproves.
Historical experience never comments upon itself. It needs to be
interpreted from the point of view of theories constructed without
the aid of experimental observations. There is no need to enter into
an epistemological analysis of the logical and philosophical problems
involved. It is enough to refer to the fact that nobody - whether
scientist or layman - ever proceeds otherwise when dealing with
historical experience. Every discussion of the relevance and meaning
of historical facts falls back very soon on a discussion of abstract
general principles, logically antecedent to the facts to be elucidated
and interpreted. Reference to historical experience can never solve
any problem or answer any question. The same historical events
and the same statistical figures are claimed as confirmations of
contradictory theories.
If history could prove and teach us anything, it would be that
private ownership of the means of production is a necessary requisite
of civilization and material well-being. All civilizations have up to
now been based on private property. Only nations committed to
the principle of private property have risen above penury and pro­
duced science, art and literature. There is no experience to show
that any other social system could provide mankind with any of
the achievements of civilization. Nevertheless, only few people con­
sider this as a sufficient and incontestible refutation of the sociaiist
programme.
On the contrary, there are even people who argue the other way
round. It is frequently asserted that the system of private property

583

EPILOGUE
is done for precisely because it was the system that men applied in
the past. However beneficial a social system may have been in the
past, they say, it cannot be so in the future too; a new age requires
a new mode of social organization. Mankind has reached maturity;
it would be pernicious for it to cling to the principles to which it
resorted in the earlier stages of its evolution. This is certainly the
most radical abandonment of experimentalism. The experimental
method may assert: because

a

produced in the past the result

b,

it

will produce it in the future also. It must never assert : because a
produced in the past the result b, it is proved that it cannot produce
it any longer.
In spite of the fact that mankind has had no experience with the
socialist mode of production, the socialist writers have constructed
various schemes of socialist systems based on aprioristic reasoning.
But as soon as anybody dares to analyse these proj ects and to
scrutinize them with regard to their feasibility and their abiiity to
further human welfare, the socialists vehemently object. These
analyses, they say, are merely idle aprioristic speculations. They
cannot disprove the correctness of our statements and the expediency
of our plans. They are not experimental. One must try socialism
and then the results will speak for themselves.
What these socialists ask for is absurd. Carried to its ultimate
logical consequences, their idea implies that men are not free to
refute by reasoning any scheme, however nonsensical, self-contra­
dictory and impracticable, that any reformer is pleased to suggest.
According to their view, the only method permissible for the refuta­
tion of such a - necessarily abstract and aprioristic - plan is to test
it by reorganizing the whole of society according to its designs. As
soon as a man sketches the plan for a better social order, all nations
are bound to try it and to see what will happen.
Even the most stubborn socialists cannot fail to admit that there
are various plans for the construction of the future utopia, incom­
patible with one another. There is the Soviet pattern of all-round
socialization of all enterprises and their outright bureaucratic man­
agement; there is the German pattern of ZwangswirtschaJt, towards
the complete adoption of which the Anglo-Saxon countries are
manifestly tending; there is guild socialism, under the nam� of
corporativism still very popular in some Catholic countries. There
are many other varieties. The supporters of most of these competing

584

EPILOGUE
schemes assert that the beneficial results to be expected from their
own scheme will appear only when all nations will have adopted it;
they deny that socialism in one country only can already bring the
blessings they ascribe to socialism. The Marxians declare that the
bliss of socialism will emerge only in its 'higher phase' which, as they
hint, will appear only after the working class will have passed
'through long struggles, through a whole series of historical processes,
wholly transforming both circumstances and men'. 1 The inference
from all this is that one must realize socialism and quietly wait for
a very long time until its promised benefits come. No unpleasant
experiences in the period of transition, no matter how long this
period may be, can disprove the assertion that socialism is the best
of all conceivable modes of social organization. He that believeth
shall be saved.
But which of the many socialist plans, contradicting one another,
shouid be adopted? Every sociaiist sect passionately proclaims that
its own brand is alone genuine socialism and that all other sects
advocate counterfeit, entirely pernicious measures. In fighting one
another, the various socialist factions resort to the same methods of
abstract reasoning which they stigmatize as vain apriorism whenever
they are applied agamst the correctness of their own statements and
the expediency and practicability of their own schemes. There is, of
course, no other method available. The fallacies implied in a system
of abstract reasoning - such as socialism is - cannot be smashed
otherwise than by abstract reasoning.
The fundamental objection advanced against the practicability of
socialism refers to the impossibility of economic calculation. It has
been demonstrated in an irrefutable way that a socialist common­
wealth would not be in a position to apply economic calculation.

Where there are no market prices for the factors of production be­

cause they are neither bought nor sold, it is impossible to resort to
calculation in planning future action and in determining the result
of past action. A socialist management of production would simply
not know whether or not what it plans and executes is the most
appropriate means to attain the ends sought. It will operate in the
dark, as it were. It wiH squander the scarce factors of production
both material and human (labour) . Chaos and poverty for all will
unavoidably result.

EPILOGUE
All earlier socialists were too narrow-minded to see this essential
point. Neither did the earlier economists conceive its full importance.
When the present writer in 1920 showed the impossibility of economic
calculation under socialism, the apologists of socialism embarked
upon the search for a method of calculation applicable to a socialist
system. They utterly failed in these endeavours. The futility of the
schemes they produced could easily be shown. Those communists
who were not entirely intimidated by the fear of the Soviet execu­
tioners, for instance Trotsky, freely admitted that economic account­
The intellectual
ing is unthinkable without market relations. 1
bankruptcy of the socialist doctrine can no longer be disguised. In
spite of its unprecedented popularity, socialism is done for. No
economist can any longer question its impracticability. The avowal
of socialist ideas is today the proof of a complete ignorance of the
basic problems of economics. The socialists' claims are as vain as
those of the astrologers and the magicians.
With regard to this essential problem of socialism, viz., economic
calculation, the Russian 'experiment' is of no avail. The Soviets are
operating within a world the greater part of which still clings to a
market economy. They base the calculations on which they make
their decisions on the prices established abroad. Without the help
of these prices their actions would be aimless and planless. Only as
far as they refer to this foreign price system are they able to calculate,
keep books and prepare their plans. In this respect one may agree
with the statement of various socialist and communist authors that
socialism in one or a few countries only is not yet true socialism. Of
course, these authors attach a quite different meaning to their asser­

tion. They want to say that the full blessings of socialism can be
reaped only in a world-embracing socialist community. Those
familiar with the teachings of economics must, on the contrary,
recognize that socialism will result in full chaos precisely if it is
applied in the greater part of the world.
The second main objection raised against socialism is that it is a
less efficient mode of production than is capitalism and that it will
impair the productivity of labour. Consequently, in a socialist com­
monwealth the standard of living of the masses will be low when
compared with conditions prevailing under capitalism. There is no
doubt that this objection has not been disproved by the Soviet ex1

E P I LO G U E

perience. The only certain fact about Russian affairs under the
Soviet regime with regard to which all people agree is : that the
standard of living of the Russian masses is much lower than that of
the masses in the country which is universally considered as the
paragon of capitalism, the United States of America. If we were to
regard the Soviet regime as an experiment, we would have to say
that the experiment has clearly demonstrated the superiority of
capitalism and the inferiority of socialism.
It is true that the advocates of socialism are intent upon inter­
preting the lowness of the Russian standard of living in a different
way. As they see things, it was not caused by socialism, but was in spite of socialism - brought about by other agencies. They refer
to various factors, e.g., the poverty of Russia under the Czars, the
disastrous effects of the wars, the alleged hostility of the capitalist
democratic nations, the alleged sabotage of the remnants of the
Russian aristocracy and bourgeoisie and of the Kulaks. There is no
need to enter into an examination of these matters. For we do not
contend that any historical experience could prove or disprove a
theoretical statement in the way in which a crucial experiment can
verify or falsify a statement concerning natural events. It is not the
critics of socialism, but its fanatical advocates, who maintain that
the Soviet 'experiment' proves something with regard to the effects
of socialism. However, what they are really doing in dealing with
the manifest and undisputed facts of Russian experience is to push
them aside by impermissible tricks and fallacious syllogisms. They
disavow the obvious facts by commenting upon them in such a way
as to deny their bearing and their significance upon the question to
be answered.
Let us, for the sake of argument, assume that their interpretation
is correct. But then it would still be absurd to assert that the Soviet
experiment has evidenced the superiority of socialism. All that
could be said is : the fact that the masses' standard of living is low in
Russia does not provide conclusive evidence that socialism is inferior
to capitalism.
A comparison with experimentation in the field of the natural
sciences may clarify the issue. A biolog=dt wants to test a new patent
food. He feeds it to a number of guinea pigs. They all lose weight
and finally die. The experimenter believes that their decline and
death were not caused by the patent food, but by merely accidental

587

EPILOGUE
affliction with pneumonia. It would nevertheless be absurd for him
to proclaim that his experiment had evidenced the nutritive value
of the compound because the unfavourable result is to be ascribed
to accidental occurrences, not causally linked with the experimental
arrangement. The best he could contend is that the outcome of the
experiment was not conclusive, that it does not prove anything
against the nutritive value of the food tested. Things are, he could
assert, as if no experiment had been tried at all.
Even if the Russian masses' standard of living were much higher
than that of the capitalist countries, this still would not be con­
clusive proof of the superiority of socialism. It may be admitted
that the undisputed fact that the standard of living in Russia is
lower than that in the capitalist West does not conclusively prove
the inferiority of socialism. But it is nothing short of idiocy to
announce that the experience of Russia has demonstrated the
superiority of public control of production.
Neither does the fact that the Russian armies, after having
suffered many defeats, finally - with armament manufactured by
American big business and donated to them by the American tax­
payers - could aid the Americans in the conquest of Germany
prove the pre-eminence of communism. When the British forces
had to sustain a temporary reverse in North Mrica, Professor Harold
Laski, that most radical advocate of socialism, was quick to announce
the final failure of capitalism. He was not consistent enough to inter­
pret the German conquest of the Ukraine as the final failure of
Russian communism. Neither did he retract his condemnation of
the British system when his country emerged victorious from the
war. If the military events are to be considered as the proof of any
social system's excellence, it is rather the American than the Russian
system for which they bear witness.
Nothing that has happened in Russia since I 9 I 7 contradicts any
of the statements of the critics of socialism and communism. Even if
one bases one's judgment exclusively on the writings of communists
and fellow-travellers, one cannot discover any feature in Russian
conditions that tells in favour of the Soviet's social and political
system. All the technological improvements of the last decades
originated in the capitalistic countries. It is true that the Russians
have tried to copy some of these innovations. But SO did all backward
oriental peoples too.
588

EPILOGUE
Some communists are eager to have us believe that the ruthless

oppression of dissenters and the radical abolition of the freedom of
thought, speech and the press are not inherent marks of the public
control of business. They are, they argue, only accidental pheno­
mena of communism, its signature in a cOUntry which - as was the
case with Russia - never enjoyed freedom of thought and conscience.
However, these apologists for totalitarian despotism are at a loss to
explain how the rights of man could be safeguarded under govern­
ment omnipotence.
Freedom of thought and conscience is a sham in a country in
which the authorities are free to exile everybody whom they dislike
into the Arctic or the desert, and to assign him hard labour for life.
The autocrat may always try to justify such arbitrary acts by pre­
tending that they are motivated exclusively by considerations of
public welfare and economic expediency. He alone is the supreme
arbiter to decide all matters referring to the execution of the pian.
Freedom of the press is illusory when the government owns altJ
operates all paper mills, printing offices and publishing houses, and
ultimately decides what is to be printed and what not. The right of
assembly is vain if the government owns all assembly halls and
determines for what purposes they shall be used. And so it is with
all other liberties too. In one of his lucid intervals Trotsky - of
course Trotsky the hunted exile, not the ruthless commander of the
Red army - saw things realistically and declared : 'In a country
where the sole employer is the State, opposition means death by
slow starvation. The old principle: who does not work shall not eat,
has been replaced by a new one: who does not obey shall not eat.' 1
This confession settles the issue.
What the Russian experience shows is a very low level of the
standard of living of the masses and unlimited dictatorial despotism.
The 3.pologists of communism are intent upon explaining these un­
contested facts as accidental only; they are, they say, not the fruit
of communism, but occurred in spite of communism. But even if
one were to accept these excuses for the sake of argument, it
would be nonsensical to maintain that the Soviet 'experiment'
has demonstrated anything in favour of commumsm and
socialism.

§ IO
The Alleged lnevitabiliry

if Socialism

Many people believe that the coming of totalitarianism is inevit­
able. The 'wave of the future', they say, 'carries mankind inexorably
towards a system under which all human affairs are managed by
omnipotent dictators. It is useless to fight against the unfathomable
decrees of history' .
The truth is that most people lack the intellectual ability and
courage to resist a popular movement, however pernicious and
ill-considered. Bismarck once deplored the lack of what he called
civilian courage, i.e., bravery in dealing with civic affairs, on the
part of his countrymen. But neither did the citizens of other nations
display more courage and judiciousness \\"hen faced 'A,ith the menace
of communist dictatorship. They either yielded silently, or timidly
raised some trifling objections.
One does not fight socialism by criticizing only some accidental
features of its schemes. In attacking many socialists' stand on divorce
and birth control, or their ideas about art and literature, one does not
refute socialism. It is not enough to disapprove of the Marxian
assertions that the theory of relativity or the philosophy of Bergson or
psycho-analysis is 'bourgeois' moonshine. Those who find fault with
Bolshevism and Nazism only for their anti-Christian leanings
implicitly endorse all the rest of these bloody schemes.
On the other hand, it is sheer stupidity to praise the totalitarian
regimes for alleged achievements which have no reference whatever
to .their political and economic principles. It is questionable whether
the observations that in Fascist Italy the railway trains ran on
schedule and the bug population of second-rate hotel beds was
decreasing, were correct or not; but it is in any case of no importance
for the problem of Fascism. The fellow-travellers are enraptured
by Russian films, Russian music and Russian caviare. But there lived
greater musicians in other countries and under other social systems;
good pictures were produced in other countries too; and it is cer­
tainly not a merit of Generalissimo Stalin that the taste of caviare is
delicious. Neither does the prettiness of Russian ballet dancers or
the construction of a great power station on the Dnieper expiate for
the mass slaughter of the Kulaks.
590

E PI LOGUE
The readers of picture magazines and the movie-fans long for the
picturesque. The operatic pageants of the Fascists and the Nazis
and the parading of the girl-battalions of the Red army are after
their heart. It is more fun to listen to the radio speeches of a dictator
than to study economic treatises. The entrepreneurs and techno­
logists who pave the way for economic improvement work in
seclusion; their work is not suitable to be visualized on the screen.
But the dictators, intent upon spreading death and destruction, are
spectacularly in sight of the public. Dressed in military garb they
eclipse in the eyes of the movie-goers the colourless bourgeois in plain
clothes.
The problems of society'S economic organization are not suitable
for light talk at fashionable cocktail parties. Neither can they be
dealt with adequately by demagogues haranguing mass assemblies.
They are serious things. They require painstaking study. They
must not be taken lightly.
The socialist propaganda never encountered any decided opposi­
tion. The devastating critique by which the economists exploded
the futility and impracticability of the socialist schemes and doctrines
did not reach the moulders of public opinion. The universities were
mostly dominated by socialist or interventionist pedants not only in
continental Europe, where they were owned and operated by the
governments, but even in the Anglo-Saxon countries. The politicians
and the st�tesmen, anxious not to lose popularity, were lukewarm in
their defence of freedom. The policy of appeasement, so much
criticized when applied in the case of the Nazis and the Fascists, was
practised universally for many decades with regard to all other
brands of socialism.

It was this defeatism that made the rising

generation believe that the victory of socialism is inevitable.
It is not true that the masses are vehemently asking for socialism
and that there is no means to resist them. The masses favour social­
ism because they trust the socialist propaganda of the intellectuals.
The intellectuals, not the populace, are moulding public opinion.
It is a lame excuse of the intellectuals that they must yield to the
masses. They themselves have generated the socialist ideas and

indoctrinated the masses with them. No proletarian or son of a
proletarian has contributed to the elaboration of the interventionist
and socialist programmes. Their authors were all of bourgeois back­
ground. The esoteric writings of dialectical materialism, of Hegel,

5,9 1

EPILOGUE
the father both of Marxism and of German aggressive nationalism,
the books of Georges Sorel, of Gentile and of Spengler were not read
by the average man; they did not move the masses directly. It was
the intellectuals who popularized them.
The intellectual leaders of the peoples have produced and propa­
gated the fallacies which are on the point of destroying liberty and
Western civilization. The intellectuals alone are responsible for the
mass slaughters which are the characteristic mark of our century.
They alone can reverse the trend and pave the way for a resurrection
of freedom.
Not mythical 'material productive forces', but reason and ideas
determine the course of human affairs. What is needed to stop the
trend towards socialism and despotism is common sense and moral
courage.
