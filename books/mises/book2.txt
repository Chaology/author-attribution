FOREWORD
My husband wrote the essays in this book in the early 1920s, more
than fifty years ago. They were collected and published as an anthology
in 1929 by Gustav Fischer, formerly in Jena, now in Stuttgart, under
the title Kritik des Interventionismus. Although these articles deal with
the economic problems of that day, the same problems are still with
us, perhaps in an even more serious and menacing way than ever.
The book has recently been republished in Germany by the Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft in Darmstadt, with a preface by my
husband’s friend and former student, the illustrious Professor F. A. von
Hayek, 1974 Nobel laureate in economics. The new German edition
includes the essay “The Nationalization of Credit?” which also appears
in this translation.
I am very happy that this book is now being made available
in English. I am no economist, but I have gone over the German
and English texts of these essays, and I congratulate Professor Hans
F. Sennholz, whom I asked to do the translation, for his brilliant work.
He has done a remarkable job of transposing the lengthy, complicated
sentences—so typical of the German language of the 1920s—into
fluent and elegant English. I am proud to see my husband’s work
presented in this form to a new audience, and I hope it will be read
widely.

INTRODUCTION
We may grow in knowledge of truth, but its great principles are forever
the same. The economic principles that Ludwig von Mises expounded
in these six essays during the 1920s have endured the test of time,
being as valid today as they were in the past. Surely, the names and
places have changed, but the inescapable interdependence of market
phenomena is the same today, during the 1970s, as it was during
the 1920s, and as valid for present-day Americans as it was for the
Germans of the Weimar Republic.
And yet, most social scientists today are as ignorant of this interdependence of economic phenomena as they were during the 1920s.
They are statists, or as Professor Mises preferred to call them, “etatists,”
who are calling upon government to assume ever more responsibilities
for the economic well-being of its citizens. No matter what modern
economists have written about the general validity of economic laws,
the statists prefer their ethical judgments over economic principles,
and political power over voluntary cooperation. Without government
control and regulation, central planning and authority, they are convinced, economic life would be brutal and chaotic.
In this collection of essays Ludwig von Mises emphasizes again
and again that society must choose between two systems of social
organization: either it can create a social order that is built on private
property in the means of production, or it can establish a command
system in which government owns or manages all production and distribution. There is no logical third system of a private property order
subject to government regulation. The “middle of the road” leads to
socialism because government intervention is not only superfluous
and useless, but also harmful. It is superfluous because the interdependence of market phenomena narrowly circumscribes individual
action and economic relations. It is useless because government regulation cannot achieve the objectives it is supposed to achieve. And it
is harmful because it hampers man’s productive efforts where, from
the consumers’ viewpoint, they are most useful and valuable. It lowers
labor productivity and redirects production along lines of political
command, rather than consumer satisfaction.
And yet, most American economists tenaciously cling to their faith
ix

in the middle of the road with all its government regulations and
controls. Like the German “Socialists of the Chair,” whose doctrines
face Professor von Mises’ incisive critique in these pages, American
“mainstream” economists are seeking the safety of an impartial middle
position between classical liberalism and communism. But while they
may feel safe on the middle of the road, hopefully equally distant from
the competing systems, they are actually paving the way for socialism.
Paul A. Samuelson, the “mainstream economist” par excellence,
devotes his Economics (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1976), the
textbook for millions of students, to modern post-Keynesian political
economy, whose fruits, according to the author, are “the better working
of the mixed economy” (p. 845). Like the Socialists of the Chair long
before him, he simply ignores “conservative counterattacks against
mainstream economics.” He neither defines nor describes these attacks,
which he repels with a four-line gesture of disgust after he announces
them in a boldface title. With selfishness, ignorance, and malice “there
is not much intellectual arguing that can be done” (p. 847).
He devotes half a page to the “Chicago School Libertarianism” of
men like Frank Knight, Henry C. Simons, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton
Friedman. And like the Socialists of the Chair, he merely labels pleas
for individual freedom and the private property order as “provocative
negations.” His favorite target, Milton Friedman, is dispatched with an
ugly joke: “If Milton Friedman had never existed, it would have been
necessary to invent him” (p. 848).
But the champions of all-round government ownership or control
in the means of production are treated with utmost courtesy and
respect. He devotes eight pages of text supplemented by eight pages
of appendix to “eminent, competent,” and “eloquent” advocates of
radical economics from Karl Marx to John G. Gurley. He quotes extensively from their writings without refuting any of their arguments. To
Samuelson, as to the Socialists of the Chair, Karl Marx “was as much
a philosopher, historian, sociologist, and revolutionist. And make no
mistake. He was a learned man” (p. 855). In fact, Samuelson echoes
Engels: “Marx was a genius . . . the rest of us were talented at best”
(p. 853).
If this is the middle of the road, or “mainstream economics,” the
future of the American private property system is overshadowed by
the dark clouds of Marxian doctrine and policy. This is why Ludwig
von Mises’ Critique of Interventionism is as pertinent and timely today
as it was half a century ago.

PREFACE
The fighting between nations and states, and domestically between
political parties, pressure groups, and cliques, so greatly occupies our
attention that we tend to overlook the fact that all the fighting parties,
in spite of their furious battling, pursue identical economic objectives.
We must include here even the advocates of a socialization of the
means of production who, as partisans of the Second International and
then the Third International with its approval of the New Economic
Policy (NEP), at least for the present and near future renounced the
realization of their program. Nearly all writers on economic policy
and nearly all statesmen and party leaders are seeking an ideal system
which, in their belief, is neither capitalistic nor socialistic, is based
neither on private property in the means of production nor on public
property. They are searching for a system of private property that is
hampered, regulated, and directed through government intervention
and other social forces, such as labor unions. We call such an economic
policy interventionism, the system itself the hampered market order.
Communism and fascism are in agreement on this program. The
Christian churches and various sects concur with the Moslems of the
Middle East and India, the Hindus, Buddhists, and the followers of
other Asiatic cultures. And anyone reflecting upon the programs and
actions of the political parties of Germany, Great Britain, and the
United States must conclude that differences exist only in the methods
of interventionism, not in its rationale.
In their entirety the following five essays and articles constitute
a critique of interventionist policies and their underlying ideologies.
Four of them have been published in recent years-three in journals
and one in the Handbook of Social Sciences. The second essay deals
with Professor Schmalenbach’s recent theories, among other things,
and is published here for the first time.

INTERVENTIONISM
1

1

INTERVENTIONISM AS AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM

Ever since the Bolshevists abandoned their attempt to realize the socialist ideal of a social order all at once in Russia and, instead, adopted
the New Economic Policy, or NEP, the whole world has had only one
real system of economic policy: interventionism. Some of its followers
and advocates are thinking of it as a temporary system that is to be
replaced sooner or later with another order of the socialist variety. All
Marxian socialists, including the Bolshevists, together with the democratic socialists of various persuasions, belong to this group. Others
are holding to the belief that we are dealing with interventionism
as a permanent economic order. But at the present this difference in
opinion on the duration of interventionist policy has only academic
significance. All its followers and advocates fully agree that it is the
correct policy for the coming decades, even the coming generations.
And all agree that interventionism constitutes an economic policy that
will prevail in the forseeable future.
Interventionism seeks to retain private property in the means of
production, but authoritative commands, especially prohibitions, are
to restrict the actions of private owners. If this restriction reaches the
point that all important decisions are made along lines of authoritative
command, if it is no longer the profit motive of landowners, capitalists,
and entrepreneurs, but reasons of state, that decide what is to be
produced and how it is produced, then we have socialism even if we
retain the private property label. Othmar Spann is completely correct
when he calls such a system “a private property order in a formal
sense, but socialism in substance.”2 Public ownership in the means of
production is nothing but socialism or communism.
However, interventionism does not want to go that far. It does not
seek to abolish private property in production; it merely wants to limit
it. On the one hand, it considers unlimited private property harmful
to society, and on the other hand, it deems the public property order
unrealizable completely, at least for the present. Therefore, it seeks to

create a third order: a social system that occupies the center between
the private property order and the public property order. Thus, it
seeks to avoid the “excesses” and evils of capitalism, but to retain
the advantages of individual initiative and industry which socialism
cannot bring forth.
The champions of this private property order, which is guided, regulated, and controlled by the state and other social organizations, are
making demands that have always been made by political leaders and
masses of people. When economics was yet unknown, and man was
unaware that goods prices cannot be “set” arbitrarily but are narrowly
determined by the market situation, government commands sought
to regulate economic life. Only classical economics revealed that all
such interventions in the functioning of the market can never achieve
the objectives which the authorities aim to achieve. The old liberalism
which built its economic policies on the teachings of classical economics therefore categorically rejected all such interventions. Laissez
faire et laissez passer! Even Marxian socialists have not judged interventionism any differently from the classical liberals. They sought to
demonstrate the absurdity of all interventionist proposals and labeled
them contemptuously as “bourgeois.” The ideology that is swaying the
world today is recommending the very system of economic policy that
is rejected equally by classical liberalism and older Marxism.
2

THE NATURE OF INTERVENTION

The problem of interventionism must not be confused with that of
socialism. We are not dealing here with the question of whether or
not socialism in any form is conceivable or realizable. We are not
here seeking an answer to the question of whether human society
can be built on public property in the means of production. The
problem at hand is, What are the consequences of government and
other interventions in the private property order? Can they achieve
the result they are supposed to achieve?
A precise definition of the concept “intervention” is now in order.
1. Measures that are taken for the purpose of preserving and
securing the private property order are not interventions in this sense.
This is so self-evident that it should need no special emphasis. And yet
it is not completely redundant, as our problem is often confused with
the problem of anarchism. It is argued that if the state must protect the
private property order, it follows that further government interventions
should also be permissible. The anarchist who rejects any kind of state

THE NATURE OF INTERVENTION 3

activity is said to be consistent. But he who correctly perceives the
impracticability of anarchism and seeks a state organization with its
apparatus of coercion in order to secure social cooperation is said to
be inconsistent when he limits government to a narrow function.
Obviously, this reasoning completely misses the point. We are not
here discussing the question of whether or not social cooperation
can do without the organization of coercion, which is the state, or
government. The sole point under discussion is whether there are
only two conceivable possibilities of social organization with division
of labor, that is, the public property order and the private property
order—disregarding syndicalism—or whether there is yet a third system as assumed by interventionists, namely, a private property order
that is regulated through government intervention. Incidentally, we
must carefully distinguish between the question of whether or not government is necessary and the question of where and how government
authority is in order. The fact that social life cannot do without the
government apparatus of coercion cannot be used to conclude also
that restraint of conscience, book censorship, and similar measures
are desirable, or that certain economic measures are necessary, useful,
or merely feasible.
Regulations for the preservation of competition do not at all belong
to those measures preserving the private property order. It is a popular
mistake to view competition between several producers of the same
product as the substance of the ideal liberal economic order. In reality, the central notion of classical liberalism is private property, and
not a certain misunderstood concept of free competition. It does not
matter that there are many recording studios, but it does matter that
the means of record production are owned privately rather than by
government. This misunderstanding, together with an interpretation
of freedom that is influenced by the natural rights philosophy, has
led to attempts at preventing the development of large enterprises
through laws against cartels and trusts. We need not here discuss the
desirability of such a policy. But we should observe that nothing is less
important for an understanding of the economic effects of a certain
measure than its justification or rejection by some juristic theory.
Jurisprudence, political science, and the scientific branch of politics
cannot offer any information that could be used for a decision on the
pros and cons of a certain policy. It is rather unimportant that this
pro or that con corresponds to some law or constitutional document,
even if it should be as venerable and famous as the Constitution of the
United States of America. If human legislation proves to be illsuited

4 INTERVENTIONISM

to the end in view, it must be changed. A discussion of the suitability of policy can never accept the argument that it runs counter to
statute, law, or constitution. This is so obvious that it would need no
mention were it not for the fact that it is forgotten time and again.
German writers sought to deduce social policy from the character of
the Prussian state and “social royalty.” In the United States, economic
discussion now uses arguments that are derived from the Constitution
or an interpretation of the concepts of freedom and democracy. A noteworthy theory of interventionism set forth by Professor J. R. Commons
is largely built on this rationale and has great practical significance
because it represents the philosophy of the La Follette party and the
policy of the state of Wisconsin. The authority of the American Constitution is limited to the Union. But locally the ideals of democracy,
liberty, and equality reign supreme and give rise, as we can observe
everywhere, to the demand for abolition of private property or its
“limitation.” All this is insignificant for our discussion and, therefore,
does not concern us here.
2. Partial socialization of the means of production is no intervention
in our sense. The concept of intervention assumes that private property
is not abolished, but that it still exists in substance rather than merely
in name. Nationalization of a railroad constitutes no intervention; but
a decree that orders an enterprise to charge lower freight rates than it
otherwise would is intervention.
3. Government measures that use market means, that is, seek to
influence demand and supply through changes of market factors, are
not included in this concept of intervention. If government buys milk
in the market in order to sell it inexpensively to destitute mothers
or even to distribute it without charge, or if government subsidizes
educational institutions, there is no intervention. (We shall return to
the question of whether the method by which government acquires
the means for such actions constitutes “intervention.”) However, the
imposition of price ceilings for milk signifies intervention.
Intervention is a limited order by a social authority forcing the owners
of the means of production and entrepreneurs to employ their means in
a different manner than they otherwise would. A “limited order” is an
order that is no part of a socialist scheme of orders, i.e., a scheme of
orders regulating all of production and distribution, thus replacing
private property in the means of production with public property.
Particular orders may be quite numerous, but as long as they do not
aim at directing the whole economy and replacing the profit motive
of individuals with obedience as the driving force of human action

RESTRICTIONS OF PRODUCTION 5

they must be regarded as limited orders. By “means of production” we
mean all goods of higher order, including the merchants’ inventories
of ready goods which have not yet reached the consumers.
We must distinguish between two groups of such orders. One group
directly reduces or impedes economic production (in the broadest
sense of the word including the location of economic goods). The
other group seeks to fix prices that differ from those of the market. The
former may be called “restrictions of production”; the latter, generally
known as price controls, we are calling “interference with the structure
of prices.”3
3

RESTRICTIONS OF PRODUCTION

Economics need not say much about the immediate effect of production restrictions. Government or any organization of coercion can at
first achieve what it sets out to achieve through intervention. But
whether it can achieve the remoter objectives sought indirectly by the
intervention is a different question. And it must further be determined
whether the result is worth the cost, that is, whether the intervening
authority would embark upon the intervention if it were fully aware
of the costs. An import duty, for instance, is surely practical, and its
immediate effect may correspond to the government’s objective. But it
does not follow at all that the import duty can realize the government’s
ultimate objective. At this point the economist’s work commences. The
purpose of the theorists of free trade was not to demonstrate that
tariffs are impractical or harmful, but that they have unforeseen consequences and do not, nor can they, achieve what their advocates expect
of them. What is even more significant, as they observed, protective
tariffs as well as all other production restrictions reduce the productivity of human labor. The result is always the same: a given expenditure
of capital and labor yields less with the restriction than without it, or
from the beginning less capital and labor is invested in production.
This is true with protective tariffs that cause grain to be grown in less
fertile soil while more fertile land is lying fallow, with class restrictions
of trade and occupation (such as the certificates of qualification for
certain occupations in Austria, or the favored tax treatment of small
enterprises) which promote less productive businesses at the expense
3
There may be some doubt about the suitability of a third group: interference by
taxation which consists of expropriation of some wealth or income. We did not allow for
such a group because the effects of such intervention may in part be identical with those
of production restrictions, and in part consist of influencing the distribution of production
income without redirecting production itself.

6 INTERVENTIONISM

of more productive activity, and, finally, with the limitation of labor
time and of the employment of certain labor (women and children),
which diminishes the quantity of available labor.
It may very well be that government would have intervened even
with full knowledge of the consequences. It may intervene in the belief
that it will achieve other, not purely economic, objectives, which are
thought to be more important than the expected reduction in output.
But we doubt very much that this would ever be the case. The fact is
that all production restrictions are supported wholly or partially by
arguments that are to prove that they raise productivity, not lower it.
Even the legislation that reduces the labor of women and children was
enacted because it was believed that only entrepreneurs and capitalists
would be handicapped while the protected labor groups would have
to work less.
The writings of the “Socialists of the Chair” have been rightly
criticized in that, in the final analysis, there can be no objective concept of productivity and that all judgments on economic goals are
subjective. But when we assert that production restrictions reduce
labor productivity, we do not yet enter the field where differences in
subjective judgments prohibit observations on the goals and means of
action. When the formation of nearly autarkic economic blocs hampers the international division of labor, preventing the advantages of
specialized large-scale production and the employment of labor at
the most advantageous locations, we face undesirable consequences
on which the opinions of most inhabitants of the earth should not
differ. To be sure, some may believe that the advantages of autarky
outweigh its disadvantages. In the discussion of the pros and cons its
advocates brazenly assert that autarky does not diminish the quantity
and quality of economic goods, or else they do not speak about it
openly and clearly. Obviously, they are fully aware that their propaganda would be less effective if they were to admit the whole truth of
the consequences.
All production restrictions directly hamper some production inasmuch as they prevent certain employment opportunities that are open
to the goods of higher order (land, capital, labor). By its very nature,
a government decree that “it be” cannot create anything that has not
been created before. Only the naive inflationists could believe that
government could enrich mankind through fiat money. Government
cannot create anything; its orders cannot even evict anything from the
world of reality, but they can evict from the world of the permissible.
Government cannot make man richer, but it can make him poorer.

INTERFERENCE WITH PRICES 7

With most production restrictions this is so clear that their sponsors
rarely dare openly claim credit for the restrictions. Many generations
of writers, therefore, sought in vain to demonstrate that production
restrictions do not reduce the quantity and quality of output. There
is no need to deal again with the protective tariff arguments that are
raised from a purely economic point of view. The only case that can be
made on behalf of protective tariffs is this: the sacrifices they impose
could be offset by other, noneconomic advantages—for instance, from
a national and military point of view it could be desirable to more or
less isolate a country from the world.4
Indeed, it is difficult to ignore the fact that production restrictions
always reduce the productivity of human labor and thus the social
dividend. Therefore, no one dares defend the restrictions as a separate
system of economic policy. Their advocates—at least the majority of
them—are now promoting them as mere supplements to government
interference with the structure of prices. The emphasis of the system
of interventionism is on price intervention.
4

INTERFERENCE WITH PRICES

Price intervention aims at setting goods prices that differ from those
the unhampered market would set.
When the unhampered market determines prices, or would determine prices if government had not interfered, the proceeds cover
the cost of production. If government sets a lower price, proceeds
fall below cost. Merchants and producers will now desist from selling—excepting perishable goods that quickly lose value—in order to
save the goods for more favorable times when, hopefully, the control
will be lifted. If government now endeavors to prevent a good’s disappearance from the market, a consequence of its own intervention, it
cannot limit itself to setting its price, but must simultaneously order
that all available supplies be sold at the regulated price.
Even this is inadequate. At the ideal market price supply and
demand would coincide. Since government has decreed a lower price
the demand has risen while the supply has remained unchanged. The
available supply now does not suffice to satisfy the demand at the fixed
price. Part of the demand will remain unsatisfied. The market mechanism, which normally brings demand and supply together through

economy], Vienna, 1919, p. 56 et seq., especially with regard to German policies since the
1870s.

8 INTERVENTIONISM

changes in price, ceases to function. Customers who were willing to
pay the official price turn away in disappointment because the early
purchasers or those who personally knew the sellers had bought the
whole supply. If government wishes to avoid the consequences of its
own intervention, which after all are contrary to its own intention, it
must resort to rationing as a supplement to price controls and selling
orders. In this way government determines the quantity that may be
sold to each buyer at the regulated price.
A much more difficult problem arises when the supplies that were
available at the moment of price intervention are used up. Since
production is no longer profitable at the regulated price, it is curtailed
or even halted. If government would like production to continue, it
must force the producers to continue, and it must also control the
prices of raw materials, semifinished products, and wages. But such
controls must not be limited to a few industries which government
meant to control because their products are believed to be especially
important. The controls must encompass all branches of production,
the prices of all goods and all wages, and the economic actions of all
entrepreneurs, capitalists, landowners, and workers. If any industry
should remain free, capital and labor will move to it and thus frustrate
the purpose of government’s earlier intervention. Surely, government
would like an ample supply of those products it deemed so important
and therefore sought to regulate. It never intended that they should
now be neglected on account of the intervention.5
Our analysis thus reveals that in a private property order isolated
intervention fails to achieve what its sponsors hoped to achieve. From
their point of view, intervention is not only useless, but wholly unsuitable because it aggravates the “evil” it meant to alleviate. Before the
price was regulated, the economic good was too expensive in the
opinion of the authority; now it disappears from the market. But this
was not the intention of the authority seeking to lower the price for
consumers. On the contrary, from its own point of view, the scarcity
and inability to find a supply must appear as the far greater evil. In this
sense it may be said that limited intervention is illogical and unsuitable,
that the economic system that works through such interventions is
unworkable and unsuitable, and that it contradicts economic logic.
5
On the effectiveness of price controls versus monopolistic prices see my “Theorie
der Preistaxen” [Theory of Price Controls] in Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften
[Handbook of social sciences], 4th ed., vol. VI, p. 1061 et seq. The essay appears below in
this collection. To understand price controls as they are directed at monopolistic prices,
we must not be influenced by popular terminology that detects “monopolies” everywhere,
but work rather with the strictly economic concepts of monopoly.

INTERFERENCE WITH PRICES 9

If government is not inclined to alleviate the situation through
removing its limited intervention and lifting its price control, its first
step must be followed by others. Its decree that set price ceilings must
be followed not only by decrees on the sale of all available supplies
and the introduction of rationing, but also price controls on the goods
of higher order and wage controls and, finally, mandatory labor for
businessmen and workers. And such decrees must not be limited to a
single or a few industries, but must cover all branches of production.
There is no other choice: government either abstains from limited
interference with the market forces, or it assumes total control over
production and distribution. Either capitalism or socialism; there is no
middle of the road.
Let us take yet another example: the minimum wage, wage control.
It is unimportant whether government imposes the control directly, or
labor unions through physical coercion or threats prevent employers
from hiring workers who are willing to work for lower wages.6 As
wages rise, so must the costs of production and also prices. If the
wage earners were the only consumers as buyers of the final products,
an increase in real wages by this method would be inconceivable.
The workers would lose as consumers what they gained as wage
earners. But there are also consumers whose income is derived from
property and entrepreneurial activity. The wage boost does not raise
their incomes; they cannot pay the higher prices and, therefore, must
curtail their consumption. The decline in demand leads to dismissal of
workers. If the labor union coercion were ineffective, the unemployed
would exert a labor market pressure that would reduce the artificially
raised wages to the natural market rate. But this escape has been
closed. Unemployment, a friction phenomenon that soon disappears
in an unhampered market order, becomes a permanent institution in
interventionism.
As government did not mean to create such a condition, it must
intervene again. It forces employers either to reinstate the unemployed
workers and pay the fixed rate, or to pay taxes that compensate the
unemployed. Such a burden consumes the owners’ income, or at least
reduces it greatly. It is even conceivable that the entrepreneurs’ and
6
It should be noted that we are not dealing here with the question of whether or
not wage rates can be raised permanently and universally through collective bargaining,
but with the consequences of a general wage boost achieved artificially through physical
coercion. To avoid a theoretical difficulty pertaining to money, namely that a general rise
in prices is impossible without a change in the ratio between the quantity of money and its
demand, we may assume that together with the boost in wages a corresponding reduction
in the demand for money takes place through a reduction in cash holdings (e.g., as a result
of additional paydays).

10 INTERVENTIONISM

owners’ income no longer can carry this burden, but that it must
be paid out of capital. But if nonlabor income is consumed by such
burdens we realize that it must lead to capital consumption. Capitalists
and entrepreneurs, too, want to consume and live even when they
are earning no incomes. They will consume capital. Therefore, it
is unsuitable and illogical to deprive entrepreneurs, capitalists, and
land owners of their incomes and leave control over the means of
production in their hands. Obviously, the consumption of capital in the
end reduces wage rates. If the market wage structure is unacceptable
the whole private property order must be abolished. Wage controls
can raise rates only temporarily, and only at the price of future wage
reductions.
The problem of wage controls is of such great importance today
that we must analyze it in yet another way, taking into consideration the international exchange of goods. Let us suppose that economic goods are exchanged between two countries, Atlantis and
Thule. Atlantis supplies industrial products, Thule agricultural products. Under the influence of Friedrich List,* Thule now deems it necessary to build its own industry by way of protective tariffs. The final
outcome of Thule’s industrialization program can be no other than
that fewer industrial products are imported from Atlantis, and fewer
agricultural products exported to Atlantis. Both countries now satisfy their wants to a greater degree from domestic production, which
leaves the social product smaller than it used to be because production
conditions are now less favorable.
This may be explained as follows: in reaction to the import duties
in Thule the Atlantean industry lowers its wages. But it is impossible to
offset the whole tariff burden through lower wages. When wages begin
to fall it becomes profitable to expand the production of raw materials.
On the other hand, the reduction in Thulean sales of agricultural
products to Atlantis tends to lower wages in the Thulean raw material
production, which will afford the Thulean industry the opportunity
to compete with the Atlantean industry through lower labor costs. It
is obvious that in addition to the declining capital return of industry
in Atlantis, and the declining land rent in Thule, wage rates in both
countries must fall. The decline in income corresponds to the declining
social product.
But Atlantis is a “social” country. Labor unions prevent a reduction
in wage rates. Production costs of Atlantean industry remain at the old
* Editor’s note: A nineteenth century (1789–1846) German advocate of the use of
protective tariffs to stimulate national industrial development.

INTERFERENCE WITH PRICES 11

pre-import-duty levels. As sales in Thule decline Atlantean industry
must discharge some workers. Unemployment compensation prevents
the flow of unemployed labor to agriculture. Unemployment thus
becomes a permanent institution.7
The exportation of coal from Great Britain has declined. Inasmuch
as the unneeded miners cannot emigrate—because other countries
do not want them—they must move to those British industries that
are expanding in order to compensate for the smaller imports that
follow the decline in exports. A reduction in wage rates in coal mining may bring about this movement. But labor unions may hamper
this unavoidable adjustment for years, albeit temporarily. In the end,
the decline in the international division of labor must bring about
a reduction in standards of living. And this reduction must be all
the greater, the more capital has been consumed through “social”
intervention.
Austrian industry suffers from the fact that other countries are
raising their import duties continually on Austrian products and are
imposing ever new import restrictions, such as foreign exchange
control. Its answer to higher duties, if its own tax burden is not
reduced, can only be the reduction in wages. All other production
factors are inflexible. Raw materials and semifinished products must
be bought in the world market. Entrepreneurial profits and interest
rates must correspond to world market conditions as more foreign
capital is invested in Austria than Austrian capital is invested abroad.
Only wage rates are determined nationally because emigration by
Austrian workers is largely prevented by “social” policies abroad.
Only wage rates can fall. Policies that support wages at artificially
high rates and grant unemployment compensation only create unemployment.
It is absurd to demand that European wages must be raised because
wages are higher in the U.S. than in Europe. If the immigration barriers
to the U.S., Australia, et cetera, would be removed, European workers
could emigrate, which would gradually lead to an international equalization of wage rates.
The permanent unemployment of hundreds of thousands and millions of people on the one hand, and the consumption of capital on the

DESTRUCTION RESULTING FROM INTERVENTION

The history of the last decades can be understood only with a comprehension of the consequences of such intervention in the economic
operations of the private property order. Since the demise of classical
liberalism, interventionism has been the gist of politics in all countries
in Europe and America.
The economic layman only observes that “interested parties” succeed again and again in escaping the strictures of law. The fact that
the system functions poorly is blamed exclusively on the law that does
not go far enough, and on corruption that prevents its application. The
very failure of interventionism reinforces the layman’s conviction that
private property must be controlled severely. The corruption of the
regulatory bodies does not shake his blind confidence in the infallibility and perfection of the state; it merely fills him with moral aversion
to entrepreneurs and capitalists.
But the violation of law is not an evil that merely needs to be
eradicated in order to create paradise on earth, an evil that flows from
human weakness so difficult to uproot, as etatists so naively proclaim.
If all interventionist laws were really to be observed they would soon
lead to absurdity. All wheels would come to a halt because the strong
arm of government comes too close.
Our contemporaries view the matter like this: farmers and milk
dealers conspire to raise the price of milk. Then comes the state, the
welfare state, to bring relief, pitting common interest against special
interest, public economic view against private point of view. The state
dissolves the “milk cartel,” sets ceiling prices, and embarks upon criminal prosecution of the violators of its regulations. The fact that milk
does not become as cheap as the consumers had wished is now blamed
on the laws that are not strict enough, and on their enforcement that is
not severe enough. It is not so easy to oppose the profit motive of pressure groups that are injurious to the public. The laws must therefore
be strengthened and enforced without consideration or mercy.
In reality, the situation is quite different. If the price ceilings were
really enforced, the delivery of milk and dairy products to the cities
would soon come to a halt. Not more, but less milk, or none at all,
would come to the market. The consumer still gets his milk only
because the regulations are circumvented. If we accept the rather

DESTRUCTION RESULTING FROM INTERVENTION 13

impermissible and fallacious etatist antithesis of public and private
interests, we would have to draw this conclusion: the milk dealer who
violates the law is serving the public interest; the government official
who seeks to enforce the ceiling price is jeopardizing it.
Of course, the businessman who violates the laws and regulations
in order to produce regardless of government obstacles is not guided
by considerations of public interest, which the champions of the public
interest belabor continually, but by the desire to earn a profit, or at
least to avoid the loss which he would suffer complying with the
regulation. Public opinion, which is indignant at the baseness of such
motivation and the wickedness of such action, cannot comprehend that
the impracticability of the decrees and prohibitions would soon lead to
a catastrophe were it not for this systematic disregard of government
orders and prohibitions. Public opinion expects salvation from strict
compliance with government regulations passed “for the protection
of the weak.” It censures government only because it is not strong
enough to pass all necessary regulations and does not entrust their
enforcement to more capable and incorruptible individuals. The basic
problems of interventionism are not discussed at all. He who timidly
dares to doubt the justification of the restrictions on capitalists and
entrepreneurs is scorned as a hireling of injurious special interests
or, at best, is treated with silent contempt. Even in a discussion of
the methods of interventionism, he who does not want to jeopardize
his reputation and, above all, his career must be very careful. One
can easily fall under the suspicion of serving “capital.” Anyone using
economic arguments cannot escape this suspicion.
To be sure, public opinion is not mistaken if it scents corruption
everywhere in the interventionist state. The corruptibility of the politicians, representatives, and officials is the very foundation that carries
the system. Without it the system would disintegrate or be replaced
with socialism or capitalism. Classical liberalism regarded those laws
best that afforded least discretionary power to executive authorities,
thus avoiding arbitrariness and abuse. The modern state seeks to
expand its discretionary power—everything is to be left to the discretion of officials.
We cannot here set forth the impact of corruption on public morals.
Naturally, neither the bribers nor the bribed realize that their behavior
tends to preserve the system which public opinion and they themselves
believe to be the right one. In violating the law they are conscious
of impairing the public weal. But by constantly violating criminal
laws and moral decrees they finally lose the ability to distinguish

14 INTERVENTIONISM

between right and wrong, good and bad. If finally few economic
goods can be produced or sold without violating some regulation, it
becomes an unfortunate accompaniment of “life” to sin against law
and morality. And those individuals who wish it were different are
derided as “theorists.” The merchant who began by violating foreign
exchange controls, import and export restrictions, price ceilings, et
cetera, easily proceeds to defraud his partner. The decay of business
morals, which is called “inflation effect,” is the inevitable concomitant
of the regulations that were imposed on trade and production during
the inflation.
It may be said that the system of interventionism has become
bearable through the laxity of enforcement. Even the interferences
with prices are said to lose their disruptive power if the entrepreneurs
can “correct” the situation with money and persuasion. Surely, it
cannot be denied that it would be better without the intervention. But,
after all, public opinion must be accommodated. Interventionism is
seen as a tribute that must be paid to democracy in order to preserve
the capitalistic system.
This line of reasoning can be understood from the viewpoint of
entrepreneurs and capitalists who have adopted Marxian-socialistic
or state-socialistic thought. To them, private property in the means
of production is an institution that favors the interests of landowners, capitalists, and entrepreneurs at the expense of the public. Its
preservation solely serves the interests of the propertied classes. So,
if by making a few painless concessions these classes can salvage the
institution that is so beneficial to them, and yet so harmful to all other
classes, why jeopardize its preservation by adamantly refusing the
concessions?
Of course, those who do not share this view regarding “bourgeois”
interests cannot accept this line of thought. We do not see why the
productivity of economic labor should be reduced through erroneous
measures. If private property in the means of production actually is an
institution that favors one part of society to the detriment of another,
then it should be abolished. But if it is found that private property is
useful to all, and that human society with its division of labor could not
be organized in any other way, then it must be safeguarded so that it
can serve its function in the best possible way. We need not here discuss
the confusion that must arise about all moral conceits if law and moral
precepts disallow, or at least revile, something that must be preserved
as the foundation of social life. And why should anything be prohibited
in the expectation that the prohibition will be largely circumvented?

DESTRUCTION RESULTING FROM INTERVENTION 15

Anyone defending interventionism with such arguments is undoubtedly seriously deluded regarding the extent of the productivity loss
caused by government interventions. Surely, the adaptability of the
capitalist economy has negated many obstacles placed in the way of
entrepreneurial activity. We constantly observe that entrepreneurs are
succeeding in supplying the markets with more and better products
and services despite all difficulties put in their way by law and administration. But we cannot calculate how much better those products and
services would be today, without expenditure of additional labor, if the
hustle and bustle of government were not aiming (inadvertently, to
be sure) at making things worse. We are thinking of the consequences
of all trade restrictions on which there can be no differences of opinion. We are thinking of the obstructions to production improvements
through the fight against cartels and trusts. We are thinking of the
consequences of price controls. We are thinking of the artificial raising
of wage rates through collective coercion, the denial of protection to
all those willing to work, unemployment compensation, and, finally,
the denial of the freedom to move from country to country, all of which
have made the unemployment of millions of workers a permanent
phenomenon.
Etatists and socialists are calling the great crisis from which the
world economy has been suffering since the end of the World War the
crisis of capitalism. In reality, it is the crisis of interventionism.
In a static economy there may be idle land, but no unemployed
capital or labor. At the unhampered, market, rate of wages all workers find employment. If, other conditions being equal, somewhere
workers are released, for instance, on account of an introduction of
new labor-saving processes, wage rates must fall. At the new, lower
rates then all workers find employment again. In the capitalist social
order unemployment is merely a transition and friction phenomenon.
Various conditions that impede the free flow of labor from place to
place, from country to country, may render the equalization of wage
rates more difficult. They may also lead to differences in compensation of the various types of labor. But with freedom for entrepreneurs
and capitalists they could never lead to large-scale and permanent
unemployment. Workers seeking employment could always find work
by adjusting their wage demands to market conditions.
If the market determination of wage rates had not been disrupted,
the effects of the World War and the destructive economic policies of
the last decades would have led to a decline in wage rates, but not to
unemployment. The scope and duration of unemployment, interpreted

16 INTERVENTIONISM

today as proof of the failure of capitalism, results from the fact that
labor unions and unemployment compensation are keeping wage rates
higher than the unhampered market would set them. Without unemployment compensation and the power of labor unions to prevent the
competition of nonmembers willing to work, the pressure of supply
would soon bring about a wage adjustment that would assure employment to all hands. We may regret the consequences of the antimarket
and anticapitalistic policy in recent decades, but we cannot change
them. Only reduction in consumption and hard labor can replace the
capital that was lost, and only the formation of new capital can raise
the marginal productivity of labor and thus wage rates.
Unemployment compensation cannot eradicate the evil. It merely
delays the ultimately unavoidable adjustment of wages to the fallen
marginal productivity. And since the compensation is usually not paid
from income, but out of capital, ever more capital is consumed and
future marginal productivity of labor further reduced.
However, we must not assume that an immediate abolition of all
the obstacles to the smooth functioning of the capitalist economic
order would instantly eradicate the consequences of many decades of
intervention. Vast amounts of producers’ goods have been destroyed.
Trade restrictions and other mercantilistic measures have caused malinvestments of even greater amounts that yield little or nothing. The
withdrawal of large fertile areas of the world (e.g., Russia and Siberia)
from the international exchange system has led to unproductive readjustments in primary production and processing. Even under the most
favorable conditions, many years will pass before the traces of the
fallacious policies of the last decades can be erased. But there is no
other way to the greater well-being for all.

THE DOCTRINE OF INTERVENTIONISM

To prescientific thinkers, a human society built on private property in
the means of production seemed to be naturally chaotic. It received its
order, so they thought, only from imposed precepts of morality and law.
Society can exist only if buyer and seller observe justice and fairness.
Government must intervene in order to avoid the evil that flows from
an arbitrary deviation from the “just price.” This opinion prevailed in
all remarks on social life until the eighteenth century. It appeared for
the last time in all its naiveté in the writings of the mercantilists.
The anticapitalist writers are emphasizing that classical economics
served the “interests” of the “bourgeoisie,” which allegedly explains

THE DOCTRINE OF INTERVENTIONISM 17

its own success, and led the bourgeois class to its successes. Surely,
no one can doubt that the freedom achieved by classical liberalism
paved the way for the incredible development of productive forces
during the last century. But it is a sad mistake to believe that by
opposing intervention classical liberalism gained acceptance more
easily. It faced the opposition of all those whom the feverish activity of
government granted protection, favors, and privileges. The fact that
classical liberalism nevertheless could prevail was due to its intellectual
victory, which checkmated the defenders of privilege. It was not new
that the victims of privilege favored their abolition. But it was new
that the attack on the system of privilege was so successful, which
must be credited exclusively to the intellectual victory of classical
liberalism.
Classical liberalism was victorious with economics and through
it. No other economic ideology can be reconciled with the science of
catallactics. During the 1820s and 1830s, an attempt was made in
England to use economics for demonstrating that the capitalist order
does not function satisfactorily, and that it is unjust. From this Karl
Marx then created his “scientific” socialism. But even if these writers
had succeeded in proving their case against capitalism, they would
have had to prove further that another social order, like socialism, is
better than capitalism. This they were not able to do; they could not
even prove that a social order could actually be built on public property
in the means of production. By merely rejecting and ostracizing any
discussion of the problems of socialism as “utopian” they obviously
did not solve anything.
Eighteenth century writers then discovered what had already been
published by earlier writers on money and prices. They discovered
the science of economics which replaced the collection of moral maxims, the manuals of police regulations, and the aphoristic remarks
on their successes and failures. They learned that prices are not set
arbitrarily, but are determined within narrow limits by the market
situation, and that all practical problems can be accurately analyzed.
They recognized that the laws of the market draw entrepreneurs and
owners of the means of production into the service of consumers,
and that their economic actions do not result from arbitrariness, but
from the necessary adjustment to given conditions. These facts alone
gave life to a science of economics and a system of catallactics. Where
the earlier writers saw only arbitrariness and coincidence, the classical economists saw necessity and regularity. In fact, they substituted
science and system for debates on police regulations.

18 INTERVENTIONISM

The classical economists were not yet fully aware that the private
property order alone offers the foundation for a society based on
division of labor, and that the public property system is unworkable.
Influenced by mercantilist thought, they contrasted productivity with
profitability, which gave rise to the question of whether or not the
socialist order is preferable to the capitalist order. But they clearly
understood that, except for syndicalism which they did not see, the
only alternatives are capitalism and socialism, and that “intervention”
in the functioning of the private property order, which is so popular
with both people and government, is unsuitable.
The tools of science do not enable us to sit in judgment of the
“justice” of a social institution or order. Surely, we may decry this or
that as “unjust” or “improper”; but if we cannot substitute anything
better for what we condemn, it behooves us to save our words.
But all this does not concern us here. Only this matters for us: no
one ever succeeded in demonstrating that, disregarding syndicalism,
a third social order is conceivable and possible other than that based
on private property in the means or production or that built on public
property. The middle system of property that is hampered, guided,
and regulated by government is in itself contradictory and illogical.
Any attempt to introduce it in earnest must lead to a crisis from which
either socialism or capitalism alone can emerge.
This is the irrefutable conclusion of economics. He who undertakes to recommend a third social order of regulated private property
must flatly deny the possibility of scientific knowledge in the field of
economics. The Historical School in Germany did just that, and the
Institutionalists in the U.S. are doing it today. Economics is formally
abolished, prohibited, and replaced by state and police science, which
registers what government has decreed, and recommends what still is
to be decreed. They fully realize that they are harking back to mercantilism, even to the canon doctrine of just price, and are discarding all
the work of economics.
The German Historical School and its many followers abroad never
thought it necessary to cope with the problems of catallactics. They
were completely satisfied with the arguments which Gustav Schmoller
presented in the famous Methodenstreit and his disciples, e.g., Hasbach,
repeated after him. In the decades between the Prussian constitutional
conflict (1862) and the Weimar constitution (1919), only three men
sensed the problems of social reform: Philippovich, Stolzmann, and
Max Weber. Among these three, only Philippovich had any knowledge
of the nature and content of theoretical economics. In his system,

THE DOCTRINE OF INTERVENTIONISM 19

catallactics and interventionism stand side by side, but no bridge leads
from the former to the latter, and there is no attempted solution to the
great problem. Stolzmann basically seeks to realize what Schmoller
and Brentano had merely suggested. It is a sad commentary, however,
that the School’s only representative who really attacked the problem
was utterly ignorant of what his opposition was saying. And Max
Weber, preoccupied with quite different matters, stopped half way,
because theoretical economics was alien to him. Perhaps he would
have gone further had he not been cut off by early death.
For several decades there has been talk at German universities of a
reawakening of an interest in theoretical economics. We may mention
a number of authors such as Liefmann, Oppenheimer, Gottl, et cetera,
who ardently denounce the system of modern subjective economics,
of which they know only the “Austrians.” We need not here raise the
question of whether or not such attacks are justified. But we would
like to point out the interesting effect such attacks have had on the
discussion of the feasibility of the system of interventionism. Each one
of these writers summarily rejects what has been created by theoretical
economics—by the Physiocrats, classical writers, and modern authors.
In particular, they depict the work of modern economics, especially of
the Austrians, as incredible aberrations of the human mind, whereupon
they present their own supposedly original systems of theoretical
economics, claiming to remove all doubts and solve all problems. The
public, unfortunately, is led to believe that in economics everything is
uncertain and problematic, and that economic theory merely consists
of the personal opinions of various scholars. The excitement created
by these authors in German-speaking countries succeeded in obscuring
the fact that there is a science of theoretical economics which, despite
differences in detail and especially in terminology, is enjoying a good
reputation with all friends of science. And in spite of all the critique
and reservations, even these writers basically concurred with the
theoretical system in its essential questions. But because this was not
understood, they did not see the need for examining interventionism
from the point of view of economic knowledge.
In addition there was the effect of the argument on the permissibility of value judgments in science. In the hands of the Historical
School, political science had become a doctrine of art for statesmen
and politicians. At the universities and in textbooks economic demands
were presented and proclaimed as “scientific.” “Science” condemned
capitalism as immoral and unjust, rejected as “radical” the solutions
offered by Marxian socialism, and recommended either state socialism

20 INTERVENTIONISM

or at times the system of private property with government intervention. Economics was no longer a matter of knowledge and ability, but
of good intentions. Especially since the beginning of the second decade
of this century, this mix of university teaching and politics became
objectionable. The public began to hold the official representatives
of science in contempt, because they made it their task to confer the
blessings of “science” on the party programs of their friends. And the
public would no longer tolerate the nuisance that each political party
appealed to its favorite judgment of “science,” that is, to a university
professor marching in its footsteps. When Max Weber and some of his
friends demanded that “science” should renounce value judgments
and the universities should not be misused for political and economic
propaganda, they met with almost universal agreement.
Among those writers who agreed with Max Weber, or at least did
not dare contradict him, were several whose whole record stood in
open contradiction to the principle of objectivity, and whose literary
efforts were nothing but paraphrases of certain political programs.
They interpreted “absence of value judgment” in a peculiar way. Ludwig Pohle and Adolf Weber had touched upon the basic problems
of interventionism in their discussions of the wage policies of labor
associations. The followers of the labor-union doctrines of Brentano
and Webb were unable to raise any pertinent objections. But the
new postulate of “value-free science” seemed to rescue them from
the embarrassment in which they found themselves. Now they could
haughtily reject anything that did not suit them, on grounds that it
did not square with the dignity of science to interfere with the squabbling of political parties. In good faith, Max Weber had presented
the principle of Wertfreiheit for a resumption of scientific inquiries
into the problems of social life. Instead, it was used by the HistoricalRealistic-Social School as protection from the critique of theoretical
economics.
Again and again, perhaps intentionally, some writers refuse to recognize the difference between the analysis of economic problems and
the formulation of political postulates. We make no value judgments
when, for instance, we investigate the consequences of price controls
and conclude that a price ceiling set below that of the unhampered
market reduces the quantity offered, other conditions being equal. We
make no value judgments when we then conclude that price controls
do not achieve what the authorities hoped to achieve, and that they are
illogical instruments of policy. A physiologist does not indulge in value
judgments when he observes that the consumption of hydrocyanic

THE HISTORICAL AND PRACTICAL ARGUMENTS FOR INTERVENTIONISM 21

acid destroys human life and, therefore, is illogical as a “nutritional
system.” Physiology does not answer the question of whether or not a
man wants to nourish or kill, or should do so; it merely determines
what builds and what destroys, what the nourisher should do and
the killer should do in order to act according to his intentions. When
I say that price controls are illogical, I mean to assert that they do
not achieve the objective they are usually meant to achieve. Now, a
Communist could reply: “I favor price controls just because they prevent the smooth functioning of the market mechanism, because they
turn human society into a ‘senseless chaos’ and all the sooner lead to
my ideal of communism.” Then, the theory of price controls cannot
answer him, as physiology cannot answer the man who wants to kill
with hydrocyanic acid. We do not resort to value judgments when we
demonstrate, in similar fashion, the illogicality of syndicalism and the
unrealizability of socialism.
We destroy economics if all its investigations are rejected as inadmissible. We can observe today how many young minds, who under
other circumstances would have turned to economic problems, spend
themselves on research that does not suit their talents and, therefore,
adds little to science. Enmeshed in the errors described above, they
shun significant scientific tasks.
7

THE HISTORICAL AND PRACTICAL ARGUMENTS FOR
INTERVENTIONISM

Put on the spot by economic criticism, the representatives of the
Historical-Realistic School finally appeal to the “facts.” It cannot be
denied, they assert, that all the theoretically unsuitable interventions
were actually made, and continue to be made. We cannot believe, they
contend, that economic practice did not notice this alleged unsuitability. But interventionist norms survived for hundreds of years, and since
the decline of liberalism, the world is ruled again by interventionism.
All this is said to be sufficient proof that the system is realizable and
successful, and not at all illogical. The rich literature of the HistoricalRealistic School on the history of economic policies is said to confirm
the doctrines of interventionism.8
The fact that measures have been taken, and continue to be taken,
does not prove that they are suitable. It only proves that their sponsors
did not recognize their unsuitability. In fact, contrary to the beliefs
8
Zwiedineck-Südenhorst, “Macht oder ökonomisches Gesetz” [Control or economic
law], Schmoller’s Yearbook, 49th year, p. 278 et seq.

22 INTERVENTIONISM

of the “empirics,” it is not so easy to comprehend the significance of
an economic measure. We cannot understand its significance without
an insight into the workings of the whole economy, that is, without
a comprehensive theory. The authors of works on economic history,
economic descriptions, economic policies, and economic statistics usually proceed much too thoughtlessly. Without the necessary theoretical
knowledge they engage in tasks for which they are completely unprepared. Whatever the authors of the source material did not discover
usually escapes the historians’ attention also. In a discussion of an
economic regulation they are rarely inclined to examine properly and
carefully whether the intended result was actually achieved, and if it
was achieved, whether it was brought about by the regulation or some
other factors. They surely lack the ability to perceive all concomitant
effects that, from the point of view of the regulators, were desirable or
undesirable. Only in monetary history did the better quality of some
works stand out. Their authors were equipped with some knowledge
of monetary theory (Gresham’s law, quantity theory), and therefore
better understood the work they were to do.
The most important qualification of a researcher into “facts” is
complete mastery of economic theory. He must interpret the available
material in the light of theory. If he does not succeed in this, or it leaves
him unsatisfied, he must precisely elaborate the critical point, and
formulate the problem that needs to be solved theoretically. Others
then may try to solve the task. The failure is his, not that of theory. A
theory explains everything. Theories do not fail in individual problems;
they fail because of their own shortcomings. He who seeks to replace
one theory with another must either fit it into the given system, or
create a new system into which it fits. It is wholly unscientific to start
with observed “facts” and then announce the failure of “theory” and
system. The genius who advances science with new knowledge can
gain valuable information from the observation of a minute process,
either overlooked or deemed insignificant by those before him. His
mind is excited over every object. But the inventor replaces the old
with the new, not through negation, but with a view toward the whole
and the system.
We need not here deal with the deeper epistemological question of
conflicting systems. Nor need we discuss a multiplicity of opposing systems. To investigate the problems of interventionism there are, on the
one hand, modern economics together with classical theory and, on
the other hand, the deniers of system and theory, no matter how carefully they word their denial of the possibility of theoretical knowledge.

RECENT WRITINGS ON THE PROBLEMS OF INTERVENTIONISM 23

Our answer to them is simple: try to create a system of theoretical
knowledge that pleases you more than ours. Then we can talk again.
Of course, all the objections raised against theoretical economics
are economic “theories.” In fact, the objectors themselves are now writing “economic theories” and giving lectures on “theoretical economics.”
But their work is inadequate because they neglect to weave the individual tenets of their “theory” into a system, a comprehensive theory of
catallactics. A theoretical tenet becomes a theory only through a system
and in a system. It is very easy to discourse on wage, rent, and interest.
But we may speak of a theory only where individual statements are
linked to a comprehensive explanation of all market phenomena.
In their experiments the natural sciences can eliminate all disturbing influences and observe the consequences of the change of one
factor, other conditions being equal. If the result of the experiment
cannot be fitted satisfactorily into the given system of theory, it may
invite an expansion of the system, or even its replacement by a new
one. But he who would conclude from the result of one experiment
that there can be no theoretical perception would invite ridicule. The
social sciences lack the experiment. They can never observe the consequences of one factor, other conditions being unchanged. And yet, the
deniers of system and theory dare to conclude from some “fact” that a
theory, or even all theory, has been refuted.
What is there to be said about general statements such as these:
“Britain’s industrial supremacy during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries was the result of mercantile policies in previous centuries,”
or “The rise in real wages during the last decades of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth century must be credited
to labor unions,” or “Land speculation raises rents.” Such statements
are believed to be drawn directly from experience. This is not gray
theory, they tell us, but fruit from the green tree of life. But they
adamantly refuse to listen to a theorist who proposes to examine the
various tenets of “practical experience” by thinking them through, and
wanting to unite them into a systematic structure.
All the arguments the Empirical-Realistic School could advance do
not replace the lack of a comprehensive theoretical system.

RECENT WRITINGS ON THE PROBLEMS OF
INTERVENTIONISM

In Germany, the classical country of interventionism, the need to deal
seriously with an economic critique of interventionism was scarcely

24 INTERVENTIONISM

felt. Interventionism came to power without a fight. It could ignore the
science of economics created by Englishmen and Frenchmen. Friedrich
List denounced it as being injurious to the interests of the German
people. Among the few German economists, Thünen was scarcely
known, Gossen completely unknown, and Hermann and Mangold
without much influence. Menger was “eliminated” in the Methodenstreit. Formal science in Germany did not concern itself with economic
achievements after the 1870s. All objections were brushed aside by
branding them special interest statements of entrepreneurs and capitalists.9
In the United States, which now seems to assume leadership in
interventionism, the situation is quite different. In the country of
J. B. Clark, Taussig, Fetter, Davenport, Young, and Seligman, it is impossible to ignore all the achievements of economics. It was to be expected,
therefore, that an attempt would here be made to prove the realizability and suitability of interventionism. John Maurice Clark, formerly a
University of Chicago professor and now, as was his great father John
Bates Clark, professor at Columbia University in New York City, has
undertaken this very task.10
We regret, however, that only a single chapter with a few pages
deals with the fundamental problems of interventionism. Professor
Clark distinguishes between two types of social regulation of economic
actions: regulation of incidental matters, “those in which the state is
dealing with matters which are incidental to the main transaction,”
and regulation of essential matters, “those in which the ‘heart of the
contract’ is at stake and the state presumes to fix the terms of the
exchange and dictate the consideration in money or in goods, or to
say that the exchange shall not take place at all.”11 This distinction
roughly coincides with our distinction between production and price
intervention. It is clear that an economic consideration of the system
of interventionism cannot proceed any differently.
In his analysis of “control of matters incidental to the contract”
J. M. Clark does not arrive at any conclusion other than ours in an
analysis of production intervention. He too must conclude that “such

matters).

RECENT WRITINGS ON THE PROBLEMS OF INTERVENTIONISM 25

regulations impose some burdens on industry.”12 This is all that interests us in his discussion. His examination of the political pros and cons
of such intervention is irrelevant for our problem.
In his discussion of control of the “heart of the contract,” which
roughly corresponds to price intervention, Clark first mentions the
American control of interest rates. It is circumvented, he asserts,
through additional incidental charges that raise the nominal rate to
the borrower. An illegal commerce has developed in small loans to consumers. Inasmuch as decent people do not engage in such transactions,
they are the sphere for unscrupulous operators. As such transactions
must shun the light of publicity, exorbitant interest rates are demanded
and granted, which exceed by far the rates that would prevail if no
rates were fixed. “Charges equivalent to several hundred per cent per
year are the common thing. The law multiplies the evil of extortion
tenfold.”13
Nevertheless, Professor Clark does not believe that rate fixing is
illogical. In general, the loan market even for this category of consumer
loans is to be left free, with a law to prohibit an interest rate higher
than the market rate. “The law . . . may render a great service in
preventing the exaction of charges which are materially above the true
market rate.” Therefore, the simplest method, according to Clark, is
“to fix a legal rate for this class of loans which liberally covers all costs
and necessary inducements, and to forbid all charges in excess of this
rate.”14
Surely, when the interest regulation sanctions the market rates or
even exceeds them, it can do no harm. It is useless and superfluous.
But if it fixes a rate that is lower than that which would develop in
an unhampered market, then all the consequences described so well
by Clark must emerge. Why, then, the rate fixing? Clark’s answer: it is
necessary to avoid unfair discrimination.15
The concept of “unfair” or “undue discriminations” originates in
the field of monopoly.16 If the monopolist as seller is in the position to classify the potential buyers according to purchasing power
and desire intensity, to whom he offers his commodity or service at
different prices, then he does better without a uniform price. Such

conditions are given in most cases of means of transportation, electric
power plants, and similar enterprises. The freight rates of railroads
represent a nearly classical case of such a differentiation. But without further explanation one cannot call this practice “unjust,” an
interventionist charge so naively and resentfully made against monopolists. However, we need not be concerned with the ethical justification of intervention. From a scientific point of view, we merely must
observe that there is room for government intervention in the case of
monopoly.
But there is also a differential treatment of the various classes
of buyers that runs counter to the interests of monopolies. This may
be the case where the monopoly is managed as a part of a larger
enterprise in which the monopoly serves objectives other than greatest
profitability. Let us disregard all cases in which the monopolist either
is a compulsory association or acts under its influence, seeking to
achieve certain national, military, or social objectives. Freight rates,
for instance, may be set to accommodate foreign trade, or municipal services may be priced according to customers’ income. In all
such cases the interventionists approve of the differentiation. To us,
only those cases are significant in which the monopolist resorts to
differentiation that runs counter to his profit interests. It may be that
he takes into consideration the interests of his other enterprises that
are more important to him. Or he wants to disadvantage a buyer for
personal reasons, or force him to do or not to do something. In the
United States, railroads have favored individual shippers through concessions of lower freight rates, which often forced their competitors
to close their businesses or sell them at depressed prices. The public
generally censured such practices because they promoted industrial
concentration and formation of monopolies. Public opinion viewed the
disappearance of competition in individual industries with great alarm.
It failed to recognize that competition takes place among producers
and sellers not only within each individual branch of production, but
also between all related goods, and in the final analysis, between
all economic goods. And it did not recognize that the monopolistic
price charged by the few genuine monopolies—mining and similar
primary production—is not so detrimental to all, as the naive foes of
monopolies are willing to assume.17

RECENT WRITINGS ON THE PROBLEMS OF INTERVENTIONISM 27

But there is no talk of monopoly in Clark’s case of the loan market
for consumers, small farmers, merchants and tradesmen. How is it
possible to practice unfair discrimination? When one lender does
not lend at the market rate the borrower may simply go to another.
Of course, it cannot be denied that everyone is inclined—especially
among the borrowers of this lowest category—to overestimate his own
credit rating, and call the rates demanded by creditors too high.
J. M. Clark proceeds from a discussion of interest regulation to
that of minimum wages. “Artificial” wage boosts, he believes, lead to
unemployment. The rise in wages raises production costs, and thus
the product price. The quantity that was sold at the lower price can no
longer be marketed at this higher price. On the one hand, this leaves
unsatisfied buyers who would like to buy at the no longer quoted lower
price, and on the other hand, it causes unemployment of workers who
are willing to work at lower wage rates. Finally, entrepreneurs will be
willing to bring this potential demand and supply together.
So far we can again agree with Clark. But then comes an assertion that completely misses the mark—that is, that “the regulations
affecting the incidental conditions of employment” must have the
same consequences since they too raise production costs.18 But this
is not correct. If wages are freely determined in the labor market, no
raise in wages above the market rate can occur as a result of interventions, such as the shortening of labor time, mandatory insurance
of workers at the expense of employers, regulations of workshop conditions, vacations of workers with full pay, et cetera. All these costs
are shifted to wages and are borne by the workers. This fact could be
overlooked because such social interventions were introduced mainly
at a time when real wages were rising and the purchasing power of
money was falling. Thus, net wages paid to workers continued to
rise in terms of both money and purchasing power despite the everrising social costs placed on the employer. His calculations include
not only the workers’ wages, but also all costs resulting from their
employment.
Clark’s further remarks have no bearing on our problem. He
believes that wage increases, like other interventions on behalf of workers, “may prove self-sustaining through raising the level of personal
efficiency, through furnishing an added stimulus to the employer’s
search for improved methods, and through hastening the elimination
of the least efficient employers and transfering their business to those
18

Clark, op. cit., p. 455.

28 INTERVENTIONISM

who will conduct it more efficiently.”19 All this can also be said about
an earthquake or any other natural catastrophe.
Professor Clark is trained too well in theory and is too perceptive
not to notice how untenable his reasoning actually is. He concludes,
therefore, that the question of whether or not a given intervention is
a “violation of economic law” is basically “a question of degree.” In
the final analysis, Clark assures us, we must consider how severely
the intervention affects production costs or market prices. The law of
supply and demand is “no thing of precision and inexorable rigidity.”
Many times “a small change in costs of production” has no effect at
all on final prices—when, for instance, the price is usually quoted in
round numbers and the merchants absorb small changes in costs or
wholesale prices. Clark’s final word: “A large increase in wage rates
may be a ‘violation of economic law,’ in the sense in which we are
using the term, where a small increase would not be.”20
Upon careful reflection, Professor Clark yields to all the objections
by those writers who call interventionism unsuitable and illogical.
It is obvious and undeniable that the quantitative consequences of
an intervention depend on the severity of the intervention. A small
earthquake destroys less than a big one, and a very small earthquake
may leave no visible traces at all.
It is utterly irrelevant that Clark nevertheless clings to the statement that such interventions can be made and advocated. He must
admit that this leads to further measures in order to alleviate the
consequences. For instance, when price controls are imposed, there
must be a rationing in order to remove the discrepancy between supply and demand. And it will be necessary to stimulate production
directly because the normal impetus will be lost.21 At this point Clark
unfortunately discontinues his discussion. Had he proceeded he would
necessarily have come to the conclusion that there are only two alternatives: either to abstain from all intervention, or, if this is not the
intention, to add ever new interventions in order to eliminate “the
discrepancy between supply and demand which the public policy has
created,” until all production and distribution are controlled by the
social apparatus of coercion, that is, until the means of production are
nationalized.
In the case of minimum wage legislation it is a very unsatisfactory
solution for Professor Clark to recommend that the workers who lost
19

21
Ibid., p. 456.
20

RECENT WRITINGS ON THE PROBLEMS OF INTERVENTIONISM 29

their jobs be employed in public works.22 And when he points at
“energy, intelligence and loyalty” calling for government intervention,
he merely reveals his embarrassment.23
In his second to last sentence of this chapter dealing with fundamentals, Clark concludes that “government can do a great deal of
good by merely seeing to it that everyone gets the benefit of the market rate, whatever that is, and thus prevent the ignorant from being
exploited on account of their ignorance.”24 This concurs completely
with the position of classical liberalism: government shall be limited to
the protection of private property and the elimination of all obstacles
to free market access for individuals or groups of individuals. This
is nothing but another wording of the principle: laissez faire, laissez
passer. It is insignificant that Professor Clark apparently believes that
a special information program is necessary for the attainment of this
objective. Ignorance of the market situation alone cannot prevent
potential buyers or workers from exploring the situation. If the sellers and entrepreneurs are not hampered in searching for customers
and workers, their competition will reduce goods prices and raise
wages until the market rate is attained. But whatever it be, classical
liberal principles are not violated if government undertakes to publish
relevant data on the formation of market prices.
The result of Clark’s inquiry into our problem thus does not contradict our own analysis earlier in this essay. Despite Clark’s eagerness
to prove that the popular interventions are not unsuitable and illogical, he did not succeed in adding anything but the observation that
the consequences are insignificant if the intervention is quantitatively
unimportant, and that important interventions have undesirable consequences that need to be alleviated through more intervention. At this
point Clark unfortunately halted his discussion. If he had proceeded to
its conclusion, which he should have done, it too would have clearly
revealed the only alternative: either private property in the means of
production is permitted to function freely, or control over the means
of production is transferred to organized society, to its apparatus of
coercion, the state. It would have revealed that there can be no other
alternative but socialism or capitalism.
Thus, Clark’s work also, which is the most complete expression
of American interventionism, can come to no other conclusion in its
discussion of the basic questions of interventionism. Interventionism
22

23

30 INTERVENTIONISM

is a system that is contradictory and unsuitable even from the point of
view of its sponsors, that cannot be carried out logically, and whose
introduction in every case can effect nothing but disturbances in the
smooth functioning of the social order based on private property.
We owe the most recent German discussion of our problem to
Richard Strigl, a member of the Austrian School. Although not so
outspoken as J. M. Clark, he too sympathizes with interventionism.
Every line of his work, which seeks to analyze theoretically the wage
problems of interventionism,25 clearly reflects his desire to acclaim
as much as possible social policy in general and labor union policies
in particular. All Strigl’s statements are carefully worded in the same
manner that authors of previous centuries worded theirs in order to
escape inquisition or censure.26 But all the concessions which his heart
grants to interventionistic thinking concern only secondary matters
and the formulation of doctrine. Regarding the problem itself, Strigl’s
perceptive analysis comes to no conclusion other than that drawn in
scientific economic analysis. The gist of his doctrine is visible in the
sentence: “The greater the service a worker can render, the more he
will earn, provided his service is useful in the economy; it does not
matter whether his wage is determined in the free market or agreed
upon by collective contract.”27 It obviously grieves him that this is so,
but he cannot and will not deny it.
Strigl emphasizes that artificial wage increases create unemployment.28 This is undoubtedly the case where wages are raised in individual industries only, or in individual countries only, or where they
are raised unevenly in different industries and countries, or where
monetary policies are used to stem a general rise in prices. Undoubtedly Strigl’s case is important for an understanding of present-day
conditions. For a thorough understanding of the problem, however, we
must rely upon another basic assumption. To have universal validity
our analysis must assume that the rise in wages occurs evenly and
simultaneously in different industries and countries, and that monetary factors do not intervene. Only then can we completely understand
interventionism.
Of all the interventionist measures none is probably under stronger
attack in Germany and Austria than the eight-hour workday. Many

RECENT WRITINGS ON THE PROBLEMS OF INTERVENTIONISM 31

believe that the economic emergency can be met only be repealing the
eight-hour law: more work and more intensive work are needed. It is
taken for granted that the lengthening of labor time and the improvement in labor efficiency would not be accompanied by higher wages,
or at least that the increases would trail the rising labor efficiency, so
that labor would become less expensive. Simultaneously, a reduction
in all kinds of “social costs” is demanded, such as the elimination of
the “welfare tax” payable by the businessman in Austria. It is tacitly
assumed that he would retain the savings from such cost reductions,
and that his labor costs would thus be reduced indirectly. Efforts to
reduce wages directly are insignificant at the present time.
In social journals and economic literature, the discussion of the
problems of the eight-hour day, and the intensity of labor reveals a
slow but steady progress in economic understanding. Even writers
who do not hide their bias for interventionism, admit the cogency of
the most important arguments against interventionism. Seldom do
we still meet the blindness in a fundamental understanding of such
matters that characterized our literature before the war.
Surely, the supremacy of the interventionist school has not yet
been overthrown. Of Schmoller’s state socialism and etatism and of
Marx’s egalitarian socialism and communism only the names have
survived in political life; the socialist ideal itself has ceased to exert
a direct political effect. Its followers, even those who were willing to
shed blood to bring it about a few years ago, have now postponed
it or given up entirely. But interventionism as Schmoller and Marx
advocated it—Schmoller, as a foe of all “theory,” quite unhesitatingly;
Marx with bad conscience about its insoluble contradiction to all his
theories—now dominates the climate of opinion.
We need not examine here whether the political conditions are
ripe for the German people and other leading nations to turn away
from interventionistic policies. An impartial analysis of the state of
affairs may show that interventionism continues to advance. This can
hardly be denied for Great Britain and the United States. But surely
it is as futile today as it was in the past to defend interventionism
as meaningful and purposeful from the point of view of economic
theory. In fact, it is neither meaningful nor purposeful from any point
of view. There is no road from economics to interventionism. All
interventionistic successes in practical politics were “victories over
economics.”

THE HAMPERED MARKET ECONOMY
1

THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE HAMPERED
MARKET ECONOMY

With a few exceptions contemporary commentators on economic problems are advocating economic intervention. This unanimity does not
necessarily mean that they approve of interventionistic measures by
government or other coercive powers. Authors of economics books,
essays, articles, and political platforms demand interventionistic measures before they are taken, but once they have been imposed no
one likes them. Then everyone—usually even the authorities responsible for them—call them insufficient and unsatisfactory. Generally
the demand then arises for the replacement of unsatisfactory interventions by other, more suitable measures. And once the new demands
have been met, the same scenario begins all over again. The universal
desire for the interventionist system is matched by the rejection of all
concrete measures of the interventionist policy.
Sometimes, during discussion of a partial or complete repeal of
a regulation, there are voices against changing it, but they rarely
approve the given measure; they wish to prevent even worse measures. For instance, scarcely ever have livestock farmers been pleased
with the tariffs and veterinary regulations that were adopted in order
to restrict the importation of livestock, meats, and fats from abroad.
But as soon as consumers demand the repeal or relaxation of these
restrictions, the farmers rise in their defense. The champions of legislative labor protection have labeled every regulation adopted so far
as unsatisfactory—at best to be accepted as an installment on what
needs to be done. But if one such regulation faces repeal—for instance,
the legal limitation of the workday to eight hours—they rise in its
defense.
This attitude toward specific interventions is readily understood by
anyone who recognizes that intervention necessarily is illogical and
unsuitable, as it can never attain what its champions and authors hope
to attain. It is remarkable, however, that it is obstinately defended in
spite of its shortcomings, and in spite of the failure of all attempts at
demonstrating its theoretical logic. To most observers, the thought of
33

34 THE HAMPERED MARKET ECONOMY

returning to classical liberal policies appears so absurd that they rarely
bother to give it thought.
The defenders of interventionism often appeal to the notion that
classical liberalism belongs to a past era. Today, they tell us, we are
living in the age of “constructive economic policy,” namely, interventionism. The wheel of history cannot be turned back, and that which
has vanished cannot be restored. He who calls for classical liberalism
and thus proclaims the solution as “back to Adam Smith” is demanding
the impossible.
It is not at all true that contemporary liberalism is identical with
the British liberalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Certainly modern liberalism is built on the great ideas developed by Hume,
Adam Smith, Ricardo, Bentham, and Wilhelm Humboldt. But liberalism is no closed doctrine and rigid dogma. It is an application of
the principles of science to man’s social life, to politics. Economics
and social science have made great strides since the beginning of
liberal doctrine, and thus liberalism also had to change, although the
basic thought remained unaltered. He who makes the effort to study
modern liberalism will soon discover the differences between the two.
He will learn that knowledge of liberalism cannot be derived from
Adam Smith alone, and that the demand for repeal of interventionistic
measures is not identical with the call, Return to Adam Smith.
Modern liberalism differs from the liberalism of the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries at least as much as modern interventionism
differs from the mercantilism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is illogical to call the return to free trade an anachronism if
the return to the system of protection and prohibition is not also seen
as an anachronism.
Writers who credit the change in economic policy simply to the
spirit of the age surely expect very little from a scientific explanation
of interventionism. The capitalist spirit is said to have been replaced
by the spirit of the hampered economy. Capitalism has grown old
and, therefore, must yield to the new. And this new is said to be the
economy that is hampered by government and other intervention.
Anyone who seriously believes that such statements can refute the
conclusions of economics regarding the effects of import duties and
price controls truly cannot be helped.
Another popular doctrine works with the mistaken concept of “free
competition.” At first, some writers create an ideal of competition
that is free and equal in conditions—like the postulates of natural
science—and then they find that the private property order does

THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE HAMPERED MARKET ECONOMY 35

not at all correspond to this ideal. But because realization of this
postulate of “competition that is really free and equal in conditions” is
believed to be the highest objective of economic policy, they suggest
various reforms. In the name of the ideal, some are demanding a kind
of socialism they call “liberal” because they apparently perceive the
essence of liberalism in this ideal. And others are demanding various
other interventionistic measures. But the economy is no prize contest
in which the participants compete under the conditions of the rules
of the game. If it is to be determined which horse can run a certain
distance in the shortest period of time, the conditions should be equal
for all horses. However, are we to treat the economy like an efficiency
test to determine which applicant under equal conditions can produce
at lowest costs?
Competition as a social phenomenon has nothing in common with
competition in play. It is a terminological confusion to transfer the
postulate of “equal conditions” from the rules of sport or from the
arrangement of scientific and technological experiments to economic
policy. In society, not only in the capitalist order, but in every conceivable social order, there is competition among individuals. The
sociologists and economists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
demonstrated how competition works in the social order that rests on
private property in the means of production. This was an essential part
of their critique of the interventionistic policies of the mercantilistic
police and welfare state. Their investigations revealed how illogical
and unsuitable interventionistic measures were. Pressing further they
also learned that the economic order that corresponds best to man’s
economic goals is that built on private property. Surely the mercantilists wondered how the people would be provided for if government
left them alone. The classical liberals answered that the competition of
businessmen will supply the markets with the economic goods needed
by consumers. In general they couched their demand for elimination
of intervention in these words: the freedom of competition must not
be limited. With the slogan of “free competition” they demanded that
the social function of private property not be hampered by government
intervention. Thus the misunderstanding could arise that the essence
of liberal programs was not private property, but “free competition.”
Social critics began to chase a nebulous phantom, “genuinely free competition,” which was nothing more than a creature of an insufficient
study of the problem and occupation with catchwords.1
1
See the critique of such errors, Halm, Die Konkurrenz [Competition], Munich and
Leipzig, 1929, especially p. 131 et seq.

36 THE HAMPERED MARKET ECONOMY

The apology for interventionism and the refutation of the critique
of interventions by economic theory are taken much too lightly with
the assertion, e.g., by Lampe, that this critique
is justified only when it is shown simultaneously that the existing economic order corresponds to the ideal of free competition.
Only under this condition must every government intervention
be tantamount to a reduction in economic productivity. But no
serious social scientist would venture today to speak of such a
pre-established economic harmony, as the classical economists
and their optimistic-liberal epigones envisage it. There are tendencies in the market mechanism that bring about an adjustment
of disrupted economic relations. But these forces prevail only “in
the long run,” while the readjustment process is interrupted by
more or less sharp frictions. This gives rise to situations in which
intervention by “social power” not only can be necessary politically, but also suitable economically . . . provided expert advice
on the basis of strictly scientific analysis is available to the public
power and that it is followed.2

It is most remarkable that this thesis was not written during the
1870s or 1880s when the Socialists of the Chair untiringly offered to
the high authorities their infallible remedies for the social problem
and their promises for the dawn of glorious times. But it was written
in 1927. Lampe still does not see that the scientific critique of interventionism has nothing to do with an “ideal of free competition” and
“preestablished harmony.”3 He who scientifically analyzes interventionism does not maintain that the unhampered economy is in any sense
ideal, good, or free from frictions. He does not contend that every
intervention is tantamount to a “reduction in economic productivity.”
His critique merely demonstrates that interventions cannot achieve
the objectives which their authors and promoters want to achieve,
and that they must have consequences which even their authors and
sponsors did not want and which run counter to their own intentions.
This is what the apologists of interventionism must answer. But they
are without an answer.
Lampe presents a program of “productive interventionism” consisting of three points.4 The first point is that the public authority
“must possibly stand for a slow reduction of the wage level.” At least

On “pre-established harmony” see, further my essay below, “Anti-Marxism.”

Lampe, op. cit., p. 127 et seq.

THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE HAMPERED MARKET ECONOMY 37

Lampe does not deny that any “public authority” attempt at holding
wage rates above those an unhampered market would establish must
create unemployment. But he overlooked the fact that his own proposal would bring about, to a lesser degree and for a limited time, the
intervention which he himself knew to be unsuitable. When compared
with such vague and incomplete proposals, the advocates of all-round
controls have the advantage of seeming logical. Lampe reproaches
me for not caring how long the transitional frictional unemployment
will last and how severe it may be.5 Now, without intervention it neither will last long nor affect many. But undoubtedly the enactment of
Lampe’s proposal can only bring about its prolonged duration and its
aggravated severity. Even Lampe cannot deny this in the light of his
other discussion.
Anyway, we must bear in mind that a critique of interventionism
does not ignore the fact that when some production interventions are
eliminated special frictions are generated. If, for instance, all import
restrictions were lifted today, the greatest difficulties would be evident
for a short time, but there would soon be an unprecedented rise in
the productivity of human labor. These inevitable frictions cannot be
mitigated through an orderly lengthening of the time taken for such a
reduction of the protection, nor are they always aggravated by such a
lengthening. However, in the case of government interferences with
prices, a slow and gradual reduction, when compared with their immediate abolition, only prolongs the time during which the undesirable
consequences of the intervention continue to be felt.
The two other points of Lampe’s “productive interventionism”
require no special critique. In fact, one of them is not interventionistic,
and the other actually aims at its abolition. In the second point of his
program, Lampe demands that public authority eliminate the numerous institutional obstacles that stifle the occupational and regional
mobility of labor. But this means elimination of all those government
and labor union measures that impede mobility. This is basically the
old demand of laissez passer, the very opposite of interventionism. And
in his third point, Lampe demands that the central political authority gain “an early and dependable overview of the whole economic
situation,” which surely is no intervention. An overview of the economic situation can be useful to everybody, even to government, if the
conclusion is reached that there should be no interference at all.
When we compare Lampe’s interventionistic program with others
of a few years ago, we recognize how much more modest the claims
5

of this school have become. This is progress of which the critics of
interventionism can be proud.

THE THESIS OF SCHMALENBACH

Considering the dismal intellectual poverty and sterility of nearly all
books and papers defending interventionism, we must take notice of an
attempt by Schmalenbach to prove the inevitability of the “hampered
economy.”
Schmalenbach starts from the assumption that the capital intensity
of industry is growing continuously. This leads to the inference that
fixed costs become ever more significant while proportional costs lose
in significance.
The fact that an ever larger share of production costs is fixed
causes the old era of a free economy to draw to a close, and a
new era of a hampered economy to begin. It is a characteristic
of proportional costs that they occur with every item produced,
with every ton delivered. . . . When prices fall below production
costs, production is curtailed with corresponding savings in proportional costs. But if the lion’s share of production costs consists of fixed costs, a production cutback does not reduce costs
correspondingly. When prices then decline it is rather futile to
offset their fall through production cutbacks. It is cheaper to
continue production with average costs. Of course, the business
now suffers a loss which, however, is smaller than it would be in
the case of production cutbacks with nearly undiminished costs.
The modern economy with its high fixed costs thus has been
deprived of the remedy that automatically coordinates production
and consumption, and thereby restores the economic equilibrium.
The economy lacks the ability to adjust production to consumption because to a large extent proportional costs have become
rigid.6

This shifting of production costs within the enterprise “almost
alone” is “guiding us from the old economic order to the new one.”
“The old great era of the nineteenth century, the epoch of free enterprise, was possible only when production costs generally were proportional in nature. It ceased to be possible when the proportion of fixed
costs became ever more significant.” Since the growth of fixed costs

22nd year, 1928, p. 244 et seq.

THE THESIS OF SCHMALENBACH 39

has not yet stopped and will probably continue for a long time, it is
obviously hopeless to count on a return of the free economy.7
Schmalenbach at first offers proof for the relative rise in fixed
costs with the remark that the continuous growth of enterprise size “is
necessarily connected with an expansion, even a relative expansion,
of the department that is heading the whole organization.”8 I doubt
that. The superiority of a larger enterprise consists, among other
things, in managerial costs lower than those of smaller enterprises.
The same is true for the commercial departments, especially the sales
organizations.
Of course, Schmalenbach is completely correct when he emphasizes that the costs of management and many other general costs
cannot be reduced substantially when the enterprise works only at
one-half or one-fourth of its capacity. But as management costs decline
with the growth of the enterprise, calculated per unit of output, they
are less significant in this age of big business and giant enterprises
than formerly in the age of smaller operations.
But Schmalenbach’s emphasis is not here; it lies on the rise in
capital intensity. He believes that he can simply conclude from the
continuous formation of new capital and progressive application of
machines and equipment—which is undoubtedly true in a capitalist
economy—that the ratio of fixed costs will rise. But he must prove
first that this is actually the case for the whole economy, not just for
individual enterprises. In fact, continuing capital formation leads to a
decline in the marginal productivity of capital and an increase in that
of labor. The share that goes to capital declines, and that of labor rises.
Schmalenbach did not consider this, which negates the very premise
of his thesis.9
But let us also ignore this shortcoming and examine Schmalenbach’s doctrine itself. Let us raise the question of whether a relative
rise in fixed costs can actually precipitate entrepreneurial behavior that
deprives the economy of its ability to adjust production to demand.
Let us look at an enterprise that either from the start or because
of a changed situation does not come up to its earlier expectations.
When it was built its founders hoped that the investment capital not
only would be amortized and would yield the going rate of interest
but, in addition, would pay a profit. Now it has turned out differently.

40 THE HAMPERED MARKET ECONOMY

The product price has fallen so much that it covers only a part of
production costs—even without allowance for the costs of interest
and amortization. A cutback in output cannot bring relief; it cannot
make the enterprise profitable. The less it produces, the higher will
be the production costs per unit of output and the greater the losses
from the sale of each unit (pursuant to our assumption that the fixed
costs are very high relative to proportional costs, disregarding even
the costs of interest and amortization). There is only one way out of
the difficulty: to shut down entirely; only then can further losses be
avoided. Of course the situation may not always be so simple. There is
hope, perhaps, that the product price will rise again. In the meantime,
production is continued because the disadvantages of the shutdown
are thought to be greater than the operating losses during the bad
time. Until recently most unprofitable railroads were in this situation
because automobiles and airplanes entered the competition. They
counted upon an increase in traffic, hoping to earn profits some day.
But if such special conditions do not exist, production is shut down.
Enterprises laboring under less favorable conditions disappear, which
establishes the equilibrium between production and demand.
Schmalenbach’s error lies in his belief that the cutback in production, necessitated by the decline in prices, must take place through
a proportionate cutback of all existing operations. He forgets that
there is yet another way, namely, the complete shutdown of all plants
working under unfavorable conditions because they can no longer
stand the competition of plants producing at lower costs. This is true
especially in industries producing raw materials and staples. In finishing industries, where individual plants usually manufacture various
items for which production and market conditions may vary, a cutback
may be ordered, limiting output to the more profitable items.
This is the situation in a free economy unhampered by government
intervention. Therefore, it is utterly erroneous to maintain that a rise
in fixed costs denies our economy the ability to adjust production to
demand.
It is true that if government interferes with this adjustment process through the imposition of protective tariffs of appropriate size a
new possibility arises for producers: they can form a cartel in order
to reap monopolistic gains through reductions in output. Obviously,
the formation of cartels does not result from some development in
the free economy, but is rather the consequence of the government
intervention, i.e., the tariff. In the case of coal and brick, the transportation costs, which are so high relative to product value, may, under

THE THESIS OF SCHMALENBACH 41

certain conditions and without government intervention, lead to the
formation of cartels with limited local effectiveness. A few metals are
found in so few places that even in a free economy the producers may
attempt to form a world cartel. But it cannot be said too often that all
other cartels owe their existence not to a tendency in a free economy,
but to intervention. International cartels generally can be formed only
because important production and consumption areas are sheltered
from the world market by tariff barriers.
The formation of cartels has nothing to do with the ratio of fixed to
proportional costs. The fact that the cartel formation in the finishing
industries is proceeding more slowly than in staple industries is not
due to the slower rise in fixed costs, as Schmalenbach believes, but to
the complex manufacture of goods nearer to consumption, which is too
intricate for cartel agreements. Furthermore, it is due to the dispersal
of production over numerous enterprises that are more vulnerable to
competition by outsiders.
The fixed costs, according to Schmalenbach, prod an enterprise to
embark upon expansion in spite of lacking demand. There are facilities
in each plant that are used very little; even at full plant operation they
are working with degressive costs. To utilize these facilities better the
plant is enlarged. “Thus whole industries are expanding their capacities
without justification by a rise in demand.”10 We readily admit that
this is the case in contemporary Europe with its interventionistic
policies, and especially in highly interventionistic Germany. Production
is expanded without consideration of the market, but rather in view of
the redistribution of cartel quotas and similar considerations. Again,
this is a consequence of interventionism, not a factor giving rise to it.
Even Schmalenbach, whose thinking is oriented economically in
contrast to that of other observers, could not escape the error that
generally characterizes German economic literature. It is erroneous to
view developments in Europe, and particularly in Germany under the
influence of highly protective tariffs, as the result of free market forces.
It cannot be emphasized too often and too emphatically that the German iron, coal, and potash industries are operating under the impact
of tariff protection, and, in the case of coal and potash, also under
other government intervention, and these are forcing the formation of
syndicates. Therefore, to draw conclusions for the free economy from
what is happening in those industries is completely incorrect. The
“permanent inefficiency” so sharply criticized by Schmalenbach,11 is
10
11

Schmalenbach, op. cit., p. 245.
Ibid., p. 247.

42 THE HAMPERED MARKET ECONOMY

no inefficiency of the free economy, but inefficiency of the hampered
economy. The “new economic order” is the product of interventionism.
Schmalenbach is convinced that in the not-too-distant future we
must reach a state of affairs in which the monopolistic organizations
will receive their monopolistic power from the state, and the state
will superintend “the performance of the duties incumbent on the
monopoly.”12 Surely, if for any reason we reject the return to a free
economy, this conclusion completely agrees with that to which every
economic analysis of the problems of interventionism must lead. Interventionism as an economic system is unsuitable and illogical. Once
this is recognized it leaves us with the choice between lifting all restrictions, or expanding them to a system in which government directs all
business decisions—in which the state determines what to produce
and how, under what conditions, and to whom the products must be
sold. This is a system of socialism in which private property at best
survives in name only.
A discussion of the economy of a socialistic community does not
belong with this analysis. I have dealt with it in another place.13

INTRODUCTION

Heinrich Herkner, president of the Association for Social Policy, recently
published his autobiography under the subtitle “The Life of a Socialist
of the Chair.” In it he made it his task “to facilitate an understanding
of the closing era of German academic socialism.”2 In fact, it cannot be
denied that the Socialists of the Chair have said everything they meant
to say, and it seems their supremacy is now declining. Therefore, it is
time for an examination of their achievements.
On the occasion of Gustav Schmoller’s seventieth birthday, the
most eminent members of the Historical-Realistic School cooperated
in a work that was to present the results of the efforts of German
economics during the nineteenth century.3 A summary of the forty
monographs of this book was never written. The preface expressly
states that it must be left to a future analysis to take stock of the nature
and extent of the progress of German economic science as a whole.4
If anyone had tried to write this analysis, it undoubtedly would
have been disappointing. The summary more than the individual
monographs would have revealed how few of its goals the School did
achieve. It would have shown how the School, whenever it touched
upon fundamental questions, could not escape borrowing from the
discoveries of a theoretical school that is quite low in its esteem. In
each contribution that merely half-way meets its requirements, the
work of economic theorists is clearly visible despite the fact that they
stood apart from the School and were attacked by it. Bernhard’s
contribution on wages, for instance, arrives at the conclusion that
“the Historical-Statistical School barely touched the main problem of
wages.” It merely launched detailed investigations, but on the great
questions it “finally could stutter only the confession: the processes are
more complicated than the sum of our detailed investigations. There

would be no new German research if it were not for the so-called
abstract Austrian School.”5 If this is true of wages, a topic on which
the Socialists of the Chair loved to expound, how much more must it
apply to all other problems!
We are gaining the same impression from all other collections
of essays this School has published. In Outlines of Social Economics
Austrian economists dealt with the history of thought and with economic theory. And the classical contributions by Menger, Böhm-Bawerk,
Wieser, and a few other “theorists” are the only essays of lasting interest in the ten-thousand-page collection of the third edition of the
Handbook of Social Sciences.
There is yet another comprehensive Festschrift that seeks to present
the entire science in monographs. But there are signs that such collections covering motley problems, torturing readers and embarrassing
librarians, are gradually being replaced with collections dealing with
one set of problems only. On the occasion of the eightieth birthday of
Lujo Brentano, the veteran dean of academic socialism in and outside
Germany, his students published Economics After the War.6
Naturally, the quality of the individual contributions varies greatly.
And it need not be emphasized that the twenty-nine contributors
worked independently and took no notice of each other’s theories and
ideologies. But a common thread appears throughout the works—especially those the editors thought most important and which Brentano
probably read with greatest delight—namely, the intention to defend
and elaborate the “Brentano system.” The external conditions for such
a task are less favorable today than seventeen years ago. When the
Schmoller Festschrift appeared, academic socialism and HistoricalRealistic economics stood at the zenith of their reputation and political influence. A great deal has changed since then. The Schmoller
Festschrift had the sound of a fanfare. The Brentano Festschrift is calling
for discussion.

SOCIALISM OF THE CHAIR 45

differentiated distinctly, there are two schools of thought in Socialism
of the Chair: the Socialist School (state socialism or etatism), and the
Syndicalist School (at times called “social liberalism”).
Socialism and syndicalism are implacable antagonists, and the two
ideologies stand in irreconcilable contrast to liberalism. No specious
argument can ignore the fact that direct control over the means of production can only rest either with individuals, with society as a whole,
or with associations of workers in each industry. Politics can never
succeed in dividing direct control over certain means of production
between society (the state), labor unions, or individuals. Property as
direct control over means of production is indivisible. True, there can
be a social order in which some means are owned by the state or other
administrative bodies, some by labor unions, and some by individuals. In this sense, there can be partial socialism, partial syndicalism,
and partial capitalism. But there can never be a compromise between
socialism, liberalism, and syndicalism with regard to the same means
of production. This fundamental and logical implacability of the three
conceivable social orders has again and again been obscured in theory and politics. But no one has ever succeeded in creating a social
order that could be called a synthesis, or even reconciliation, of the
conflicting principles.
Liberalism is the ideology that views private property in the means
of production as the only possible, or at least best conceivable foundation of human society based on division of labor. Socialism seeks
to transfer the property in the means of production to the hands of
organized society, the state. Syndicalism wants to transfer control over
the means of production to the association of workers in the individual
branches of production.7
State socialism (etatism, also conservative socialism) and its related
systems of military socialism and Christian socialism aim at bringing
about a society in which “the management of property is left to individuals,” but its employment is supervised and guided by the collective
whole so that “formally property is private, but in substance it is
public.”8 The farmer, for instance, becomes a “civil servant and must
grow what the country needs according to his best knowledge and
7
Syndicalism as a social ideal must not be confused with syndicalism as tactics. The
specific syndicalistic tactics (the action directe of the French syndicalists) may also serve
other ideologies. For instance, they may be used toward the realization of socialism.

conscience or by government order. If he receives his interest and a
living salary, he has everything he can demand.”9 Some large enterprises are transferred directly to the state or community, all others
formally remain in the hands of their owners, but must be managed
in accordance with the plan of the authorities. Thus, every business
becomes a public office, and every occupation an “appointment.”
At the time serious consideration was still given to the SocialDemocratic program to transfer formally all means of production to
society, there seemed to exist a considerable, although not fundamental, difference between the program of the etatists and that of
the Social Democrats. Today the Social-Democratic program simply
calls for an immediate nationalization of large enterprises, while trade
shops and farms are to be under the control of the state. In this respect,
etatists and socialists are much closer today than they were a dozen
years ago.
However, the fundamental difference between the social ideals of
etatism and the Social Democrats existed in the problem of income
distribution, not in the nationalization program. It was self-evident to
the Social Democrats that all income differences were to disappear. But
etatism meant to distribute income according to “dignity.” Everyone
was to receive according to his rank. On this point as well, the gap
dividing Social Democrats and etatists has narrowed considerably.
Etatism, too, is genuine socialism, although it may differ in a
few points from the socialism of the Communist Manifesto and the
Erfurt Program. What is essential alone is its position on the problem of
private property in the means of production. Inasmuch as the Socialists
of the Chair represented etatism, and inasmuch as they demanded the
nationalization of large enterprises and government supervision and
control of all other enterprises, they engaged in socialistic politics.
But not all Socialists of the Chair were etatists. Lujo Brentano
and his School promoted a syndicalistic program, although in many
questions of daily politics they joined ranks with the other Socialists
of the Chair and, together with the Social Democrats, fought against
liberalism. As set forth, their syndicalism is no more definite and
straightforward than any other program. As a matter of fact, it is so
contradictory and leads to such absurd consequences that it could
never be unswervingly advocated. Brentano carefully veiled his position, but nevertheless it was syndicalism. It became visible in his

SOCIALISM OF THE CHAIR 47

position on the problems of labor union coercion and strike, and the
protection of workers willing to work.
If employees receive the right to shut down an enterprise as long
as its owner rejects their demands, the control over production, in
final analysis, has been placed in the hands of labor unions. The
problem must not be obscured by the confusion between free collective
bargaining—the workers’ freedom to organize—and the impunity of
workers guilty of breach of contract. The protection of workers willing
to work is an entirely different matter. As long as the work stoppage of
the workers of one enterprise or in an entire industry can be rendered
ineffective through employment of workers from other industries or
from a given reservoir of unemployed workers, the labor unions are
unable to raise wage rates above those paid without them. But as soon
as the physical force of labor, with tacit consent or open promotion by
the state, makes it impossible to replace the strikers, the labor unions
can do as they like. The workers of “essential” enterprises then can
freely determine their wage rates. They could raise them as high as
they please were it not necessary to be mindful of public opinion and
the sentiment of workers in other industries. At any rate, all labor
unions have the power temporarily to raise wage rates above those
the economic situation would determine without union intervention.
Anyone who would deny protection to workers willing to work
must raise the question of how excessive labor demands can be dealt
with. It is no answer to refer to a sensible conduct of workers or to
entrust committees of employers and employees with the power of
decision. Committees with equal representation of both sides can come
to an agreement only if one side makes the concessions. But if the
decision is to be made by the state, either as judge with the power
of binding arbitration or by the committee member representing the
state, the solution again is that of etatism, the very thing that was to
be avoided.
A social order that refuses to protect those willing to work lacks
vitality and must disintegrate in short order. This is why all political
systems, no matter how they collaborate with the unions, must finally
oppose union coercion. To be sure, prewar Germany never managed to
legislate government protection to those willing to work; an attempt
failed on account of the resistance by Brentano and his School. But
it should be noted that prewar Germany could easily have quashed a
strike in essential enterprises by calling the strikers to active military
duty. Postwar republican Germany no longer has this power at its
disposal. And yet, despite the Social-Democratic Party’s supremacy, it

48 SOCIAL LIBERALISM

has successfully taken a stand against strikes in essential enterprises
and thus has expressly granted protection to workers willing to work.
In the Russia of the Soviets, a strike is utterly impossible. Kautsky
and Lenin completely agree that willing workers must be permitted to
render a strike against vital facilities ineffective.
Etatism trusts in the wisdom and attitude of government officials.
“Our officials are learning soon enough,” writes Knapp,
how things look in the clash of economic interests. They will not
let the reins slip out of their hands, not even to parliamentary
majorities, which we know how to handle so well. No rule is born
so easily, in fact, perceived so gratefully as that of high-minded,
very learned officials. The German state is officialdom, let us hope
that it will always remain that. It should then be rather easy to
overcome the confusion and error of economic struggles.10

Brentano and his School lacked this faith in the infallibility of
government officials, on which they based their very claim to being
“liberal.” But over the years, the two schools have come very close:
the Brentano School advocated nationalization or municipalization of
a number of enterprises, and the Schmoller School emphasized the
activity of labor unions. For a long time, their positions on foreign trade
policies separated the two schools. Brentano rejected protectionism,
while the majority of etatists pursued it. On this point the etatists have
made some concessions; an ambiguous free-trade resolution, devised
in 1923 by university professors meeting at Stuttgart, revealed this
change.
Brentano himself sought to describe their differences in the fundamental questions of social policy as follows:
We both favored the activity of free organizations as well as
government intervention wherever the individual left to his own
was too weak to preserve his personality and to develop his ability.
But from the beginning our positions on both were reversed.
My studies of British conditions had led me to build my hopes
for lifting the working classes primarily on the activities of their
organizations, while it mattered much more to Schmoller that the
state assume the role of protector of the weak.11

Brentano wrote this in the spring of 1918, shortly after the collapse of the Schmoller system, and shortly before the collapse of the
Brentano system became evident. While the fundamental differences
between the two schools are not clearly delineated, they are at least
discernible.

LIBERALISM AND SOCIAL LIBERALISM

Names are unimportant; what matters is substance. The term “social
liberalism” sounds strange indeed as socialism and liberalism are
mutually exclusive. But we are accustomed to such terminology. Also,
socialism and democracy are irreconcilable in the final analysis, and
yet there is the old concept of “Social Democracy,” which is a contradictio in adjecto. If today the Brentano School, which adopted syndicalism,
and some “moderate” etatists designate their movement as “social liberalism,” no terminological objection need be raised. But we must
object—not for political reasons, but in the interest of scientific clarity and logical thought—that this designation erases the differences
between liberalism and socialism. It permits calling “liberal” that which
is the very opposite of what history and social science define as liberal.
The fact that in Great Britain, the home of liberalism, this semantic
confusion prevails is no excuse for us to accede to the practice.
Herkner is correct when he observes that the sanctity of private
property is not a dogmatically anchored objective for liberalism, but a
means for the attainment of ultimate goals. He is mistaken, however,
when he states that this is so “only temporarily.”12 In their highest
and ultimate goal liberalism and socialism are in agreement. They
differ precisely in that liberalism views private property in the means
of production as the most suitable means to attain the goal, while
socialism looks upon public property as the most suitable means.
This difference in the two programs, and this alone, corresponds to
the history of thought during the nineteenth century. Their different
positions on the problem of property in production separates liberalism
from socialism. It is confusing to present this in any other way.
Socialism, according to Herkner, “is an economic system in which
society organized in a state directly assumes responsibility for the
existence of all its members. As an economic system based on satisfying
the national needs rather than gleaning profits, the whole production
and distribution process becomes the task of public authority, replacing
12

Herkner, “Socialpolitischer Liberalismus” [Social liberalism], vol. I, p. 41.

50 SOCIAL LIBERALISM

private property in the means of production and their use for profit.”13
This is not very precise, but is stated clearly enough. Herkner then
continues, “If this system could be realized with liberal means, that is,
without force and violation of law, and if it could not only improve the
material conditions of the people, but also assure a greater measure
of individual freedom, then no objection could be raised against it
from the liberal point of view.”14 Thus, when Parliament discusses
the question of nationalization, the liberals, according to Herkner,
could vote for the common weal if it is introduced “without force and
violation of law” and if it were not for their doubts about the material
well-being of the people.
Herkner seems to believe that the older liberalism advocated private property for its own sake and not for its social consequences. Like
Wiese and Zwiedineck, he construes a difference between the older
and the contemporary liberalism. According to Herkner, “While the
older liberalism viewed private property as an institution of natural
law whose protection besides that of individual freedom was the first
duty of the state, contemporary liberalism is emphasizing ever more
strongly the social factor in property. . . . Private property is no longer
defended with individualistic reasons, but with considerations of social
and economic suitability.”15 In a similar vein, Zwiedineck observes that
there is reason for optimism “that a private property order for its own
sake and in the interest of owners only, would be of brief duration.”
Modern liberalism, too, is advocating private property on grounds of
“social suitability.”16
It cannot be our task here to examine how nonliberal theories of
natural law meant to defend private property as a natural phenomenon.
But it should be common knowledge that the older liberals were
utilitarians (they are frequently criticized for it), and that it was selfevident to them that no social institution and no ethical rule can be
advocated for its own sake or for reasons of special interest, but can be
defended only on grounds of social suitability. It is no indication that
liberalism is moving toward socialism if modern liberalism demands
private property in the means of production because of its social utility,
and not for its own sake or for the interests of owners.
“Private property and inheritance,” Herkner continues, “give rise to
unearned income. Liberalism sympathizes with the efforts of socialists

LIBERALISM AND SOCIAL LIBERALISM 51

to oppose this unearned income in the interest of justice and equal
opportunity for all members of society.”17 The fact that unearned
income flows from property is as obvious as that poverty comes from
pauvreté. In fact, unearned income flows from control over the means
of production. He who opposes unearned income must oppose private
property in the means of production. Therefore, a liberal cannot sympathize with such efforts. If he does so nevertheless, he is no longer a
liberal.
What in Herkner’s view, then, is liberalism? His answer is this:
Liberalism is a world view, a kind of religion, a faith. It is a faith
in the natural dignity and goodness of man, in his great destiny,
in his ability to grow through his powers of natural reason and
freedom, in the victory of justice and truth. Without freedom there
is no truth. Without truth there can be no triumph of justice, no
progress, thus no development, later stages of which are always
more desirable than the preceding stages. What sunlight and oxygen mean to organic life, reason and freedom mean to intellectual
development. Neither individuals, classes, nations, nor races must
be viewed as mere means for the purposes of other individuals,
classes, nations or races.18

This is all very fine and noble, but unfortunately so general and
vague that it equally applies to socialism, syndicalism, and anarchism.
His definition of liberalism lacks the decisive ingredient, namely, a
social order that is built on private property in the means of production.
It cannot surprise us that with such ignorance about liberalism
Herkner also subscribes to practically all misconceptions that are in
vogue today. Among others: “In contrast to the older liberalism which
aimed mainly at the elimination of hampering restrictions, modern
liberalism [that is, social liberalism] has a positive, constructive program.”19 If Herkner had discovered private property in the means
of production as the basic ingredient of liberalism, he would have
known that the liberal program is no less positive and constructive
than any other. It is the mentality of officialdom—which, according to
Brentano, was “the only sounding-board of the Association for Social
Policy”20 —that considers as constructive and positive only that ideology which calls for the greatest number of offices and officials. And

he who seeks to reduce the number of state agents is decried as a
“negative thinker” or an “enemy of the state.”
Both Herkner and Wiese21 expressly emphasize that liberalism has
nothing to do with capitalism. Passow tried to show that the ambiguous
terms “capitalism,” “capitalistic economic order,” et cetera, are political
slogans that, with but few exceptions, are not used objectively to
classify and comprehend the facts of economic life. Instead, they are
used to criticize, accuse, and condemn phenomena that are more
or less misunderstood.22 If this position is taken, it is clear that he
who appreciates liberalism, no matter how he defines it, seeks to
protect it from labels that are felt to be derogatory, defamatory, and
abusive. However, if we agree with Passow’s observation that for most
writers who have given the term “capitalism” a definite meaning, its
essence is the development and expansion of larger enterprises,23 we
must admit that liberalism and capitalism are closely related. It was
liberalism that created the ideological conditions that gave rise to
modern large-scale industrial production. If we should use the term
capitalism to identify an economic method that arranges economic
activity according to capital calculation,24 we must come to the same
conclusion. But no matter how we define capitalism, the development
of capitalistic methods of production was and is possible only within
the framework of a social order built on private property in the means
of production. Therefore, we cannot agree with Wiese’s contention that
the essence of liberalism was obscured by “its historical coincidence
with large-scale capitalism.”25
That which makes capitalism appear “unliberal,” according to
Wiese, is “its insensitivity toward suffering, the brutal use of elbows,
and the struggle to overpower and enslave fellow men.”26 These
expressions come from the old register of socialistic complaints about
the corruption and wickedness of capitalism. They reveal the socialistic misinterpretation of the nature and substance of a social order
that is based on private property. If, in a capitalistic society, the buyer
seeks to buy an economic good wherever it is least expensive, without
regard for other considerations, he does not act with “insensitivity

toward suffering.” If the superior enterprise successfully competes
with one working less economically, there is no “brutal use of elbows,”
or “struggle to overpower and enslave fellow men.” The process in this
case is no undesirable concomitant effect, or “outgrowth” of capitalism,
and unwanted by liberalism. On the contrary! The sharper the competition, the better it serves its social function to improve economic
production. That the stagecoach driver was replaced by the railroad,
the hand weaver by mechanical weaving, the shoemaker by the shoe
factory, did not happen contrary to the intentions of liberalism. And
when small shipowners with sailing vessels were replaced by a large
steamship company, when a few dozen butchers were replaced by a
slaughterhouse, a few hundred merchants by a department store, it
signifies no “overpowering and enslaving of fellow men.”
Wiese remarks correctly that “in reality, liberalism has never existed
on a large scale, and that the community of liberals still needs to be
created and brought along.”27 Thus, the picture of what fully developed capitalism can achieve is incomplete at best, even if we reflect
upon British society at the zenith of capitalism when liberalism was
leading the way. It is popular today to blame capitalism for anything
that displeases. Indeed, who is still aware of what he would have
to forego if there were no “capitalism”? When great dreams do not
come true, capitalism is charged immediately. This may be a proper
procedure for party politics, but in scientific discussion it should be
avoided.

CONTROL OR ECONOMIC LAW ?

Among the many mistakes to which the Socialists of the Chair of
all varieties tenaciously cling is their faith in limited government
interventions in economic life. They are convinced that, except for
syndicalism, there are three conceivable possibilities of control over the
means of production in a society based on the division of labor. Besides
public property and private property, there is the third possibility
of private property that is subject to government regulation. The
possibility and conceivability of this third system will be discussed in
this section on the antithesis of “control or economic law.”
For the Socialists of the Chair this question had special political
significance. They could maintain their claim of an impartial middle
position between the Manchester School and communism only if they
27

Ibid., p. 16.

54 SOCIAL LIBERALISM

favored a social ideal that apparently was “equally distant” from the
ideals of the two competing movements. They rejected as irrelevant
for their ideals all criticism leveled at the socialistic ideal. They could
do so as long as they ignored the fact that limited interventions in
the private property order fail to achieve their objectives, and that the
desired etatist objectives can be achieved only when private property
exists in name only and a central authority regulates all production.
Moeller observes correctly that the younger Historical School opposed
classical economics for practical reasons: “Schmoller did not care to
see his road to scientific justification of social policy blocked by the
concept of an external economic regularity independent of man.” But
Moeller is mistaken when he comments on Rist’s remark that the
classical school did not uphold the general validity of economic laws.
He is mistaken when he asserts that “it was not the ‘laws’ of classical
economics properly understood that were blocking the way.”28 Indeed,
they stood in the way because they revealed that government intervention in the operations of a capitalistic social order is incapable
of achieving the desired results, which leaves the alternative either
to renounce such intervention or go the whole way and assume control over the means of production. On this fact all the critique by
the Historical-Realistic School missed its mark. It was irrelevant that
these economic laws were not “natural laws” and that private property
was not eternal, but “only” a historical-legal category. The new economics should have replaced the theory of catallactics developed by
Physiocrats and classical economists with another system that did not
demonstrate the futility of government intervention. Because it could
not do so, it had to reject categorically all “theoretical” investigations
of economic problems.
At times it has been said that there are several kinds of economics.
This is no more correct than that there are several biologies and several
physics. Surely in every science various hypotheses, interpretations,
and arguments seek to solve concrete problems. But logic is consistent
in every science. It is true also of economics. The Historical-Realistic
School itself, which for political reasons disagreed with the traditional
and modern theories, proves this point by not substituting its own
explanations for the rejected doctrines, but by merely denying the
possibility of theoretical knowledge.
Economic knowledge necessarily leads to liberalism. On the one
hand, it demonstrates that there are only two possibilities for the
28
Moeller, “Zur Frage der ‘Objectivität’ des wirtschaftlichen Prinzips” [On the “objectivity” of economic principles], Archives for Social Science, vol. 47, p. 163.

CONTROL OR ECONOMIC LAW ? 55

property problem of a society based on the division of labor: private
property or public property in the means of production. The so-called
middle of the road of “regulated” property is either illogical, because
it does not lead to the intended goal and accomplishes nothing but
a disruption of the capitalistic production process, or it must lead
to complete socialization of the means of production. On the other
hand, it demonstrates what has been perceived clearly only recently,
that a society based on public property is not viable because it does
not permit monetary calculation and thus rational economic action.
Therefore, economic knowledge is blocking the way to socialistic
and syndicalistic ideologies that prevail all over the world. And this
explains the war that is waged everywhere against economics and
economists.
Zwiedineck-Südenhorst seeks to give the untenable doctrine of the
third possible social order a new garb. “We are dealing not only with
the institution of property,” he informs us,
but probably more importantly also with the totality of legal standards that form a superstructure over any property order and
thereby any economic order. We must realize that these legal standards are decisive for the manner of cooperation of the various
factors of production (that is, not only capital, land, and labor,
but also the different categories of human labor). In short, we
are dealing with that which comprises the organization of production. This organization can only serve the objective of placing
the momentary control conditions over the various production
factors in the service of the whole economy. Only then does it have
social character. Of course, these momentary control conditions,
that is, the property order, constitute a part of the organization
of production. But this does not lead to the conclusion that the
organization would have to differ for the individualistic and the
collectivistic economy. In fact, whether and how it can differ is
the crucial question.29

Here again, as with all representatives of etatism, is the notion that
a legal structure placing private property “in the service of the whole
economy” can achieve the objectives the authority meant to achieve.
After all, Zwiedineck only recently took his position on the problem of
“control or economic law,” which is so characteristic of all Socialists of
the Chair.30

56 SOCIAL LIBERALISM

It is remarkable that all these literary efforts produced nothing
new. Old errors that had been refuted a hundred times were dished
up again. The question is not whether the power of the state “can”
intervene in economic life. No economist would deny today that, for
instance, the bombing of a city or a prohibition of exports is possible.
Even the freetrader does not deny that import duties are possible;
he only maintains that protective tariffs do not have the effects the
protectionists ascribe to them. And he who rejects price controls for
being unsuitable does not deny that government can impose and
supervise them. He merely denies that the controls will lead to the
goal which government meant to attain.

THE METHODENSTREIT

As early as the 1870s Walter Bagehot irrefutably exploded the arguments with which the followers of the Historical School rejected the
dependability of “theoretical” inquiries in the field of economics. He
called the two methods—the Historical School considered them the
only permissible methods—the “all-case method” and the “single-case
method.” The former works with induction only, and makes the erroneous assumption that this is the road that usually leads the natural
sciences to their findings. Bagehot demonstrated that this road is
completely impassable, and that on it no science ever has achieved satisfactory results. The “single-case method,” which accepts descriptions
of concrete historical data only, fails to realize, according to Bagehot,
that there can be no economic history and no economic description
“unless there was a considerable accumulation of applicable doctrine
before existing.”31
The Methodenstreit has long been decided. Never before has a scientific exchange led to such a crushing defeat of one side. Fortunately,
this is freely admitted in Economics After the War. In his contribution
on business cycle research, which is based on a thorough knowledge
of the material, Lowe briefly touches upon the question of method and
skillfully proves the untenableness of the objections empiricists raise
against theory. Unfortunately, we must also agree with Lowe where he
observes that “the heresy of ‘impartial’ data research, which deprived
a whole generation of German scholars of its results,” has recently

Barrington, London, 1915, vol. VII, p. 100–104.

THE METHODENSTREIT 57

also intruded itself into American research.32 But it is even more regrettable that despite the thorough methodological debates in recent years,
we again and again encounter the old, long-refuted errors in German
science. Bonn, for instance, praises Brentano because in his book on
Agricultural Policy he was not content with “describing the skeleton
of a system, separated from the flesh of life. He abhored bloodless
abstractions, deductions of barren concepts, as he encountered them
in his youth. He sought the fullness of life.”33
I must admit that I find the term “flesh of life” empty. Bonn’s use
of the adjective “bloodless” in connection with the noun “abstraction”
appears illogical to me. What is the contrast to “bloodless” abstraction—perhaps “bloody” abstraction? No science can avoid abstract
concepts, and he who abhors them should stay away from science and
see whether and how he can go through life without them. When we
look at Brentano’s Agricultural Policy we find a number of discussions
of rent, land price, cost, et cetera, purely theoretical investigations
that obviously work with abstractions and abstract concepts.34 Every
investigation that in any way touches upon economic questions must
“theorize.” True, the empiricist does not know that he is theorizing, as
Monsieur Jourdain never knew that he was always speaking prose. And
as empiricists are unaware of this, they carelessly adopt theories that
are incomplete or even incorrect and avoid thinking them through logically. An explanatory theory can easily be constructed for each “fact,”
but only when the individual theories are united into a whole can we
determine the value and futility of the “explanation.” But the Historical
School rejected it all; it did not want to admit that theories must be
thought through and that they must be united into a consistent whole.
In eclectic fashion it used pieces of all possible theories and followed
indiscriminately and uncritically now this opinion, now that opinion.
But the Socialists of the Chair not only did not build a system of
their own, they also failed utterly in their critique of modern theoretical
economics. The subjective-value theory did not receive the outside
critique that is so indispensable for scientific progress. It owes its
progress during the last decades to its own initiative, to critiques from
its own ranks. This the followers of the Historical School did not even
notice. Whenever they speak of modern economics their eyes are glued

on 1890, when the achievements of Menger and Böhm-Bawerk were
generally completed. The theoretical accomplishments in Europe and
America since then remain rather foreign to them.
The critique which the champions of academic socialism leveled
at theoretical economics proved to be largely irrelevant and, without apparent reason, not free of personal hatred. As in the writings
of Marx and his disciples, a more or less tasteful joke often takes
the place of critique. Brentano thought it proper to introduce a critique of Böhm-Bawerk’s Capital and Interest—a critique which, by
the way, no one appreciated in the seventeen years since its publication—with the following: “As one of my first-semester students
correctly remarked. . . .”35 The Russian professor Totomianz, an Armenian, writes in his History of Economics and Socialism:
A German critic of the psychological school ironically observes,
not without a kernel of truth, that the soil in which the Austrian
School grew was the city of Vienna with its numerous students and
officers. For a young student seeking the pleasures of life present
goods naturally are more valuable than future goods. Similarly,
a dashing officer chronically suffering from lack of cash will pay
any interest rate on borrowed money.36

This book with such a profound critique of Böhm-Bawerk’s theory
first appeared in the Russian language. Rist wrote an introduction to
the French edition, Loria to the Italian edition, and Masaryk to the
Czech edition. In his introduction to the German edition, Herkner
acclaims the work for being “popular and perceptual.” All significant and fruitful thoughts in Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria,

economy], Leipzig, 1924, p. 113.

V. Totomianz, Geschichte der Nationalökonomie und des Socialismus [History of economics and socialism], Jena, 1925, p. 152. Even if we disregard this critique of BöhmBawerk, the Totomianz effort is wholly unsatisfactory and mistaken. He states, for instance,
on p. 146: “While Menger’s achievement mainly was the development of a new methodology, the two other representatives of the Austrian School, Böhm-Bawerk and Wieser,
built a sagacious psychological value theory.” We must conclude from this statement that
Menger contributed less to the development of the new value theory than Böhm-Bawerk
and Wieser, which is not at all correct. Totomianz introduces his discussion of the marginal
utility theory with the following statement: “The economy consists of economic goods.
These goods relate in a certain way to human well-being. This relationship is expressed
in two different grades or stages: the lower stage and the higher stage. We are dealing
with the higher stage when the economic good is not only useful, but also necessary for
well-being, so that its possession or loss entails a loss of consumption or enjoyment.” His
discussion of other economists is not better. As I do not read Russian, I cannot determine whether this nonsense must be charged to the Russian original or to the German
translation.

THE ECONOMIC DOCTRINES OF SOCIAL LIBERALISM 59

Belgium, Italy, Russia, and America find “loving and understanding
consideration” with Totomianz. He shows “remarkable ability to do
justice to such different minds as Fourier, Ruskin, Marx, Rodbertus,
Schmoller, Menger, and Gide.”37 This Herkner judgment is all the
stranger as he is very familiar with the history of economic thought.38
In the Methodenstreit the Brentano wing of the Empirical-Realistic
School acted more prudently than the followers of Schmoller. We must
give personal credit to Brentano who, a generation earlier, leveled
sharp criticism at the School’s research in economic history.
Many a writer of no more than excerpts from economic documents
believes he has written an economic treatise. But when the excerpt
is completed the economic analysis is just beginning. Its content
must then be analyzed and transformed to a picture full of life,
and the lesson must be drawn from this researched passage of life.
It is not enough to be diligent in the preparation of excerpts from
documents. It takes the power of intuition, combination, sagacity,
and the most important scientific gift: the ability to recognize the
common element in the multiplicity of phenomena. When this is
lacking we gain nothing but uninteresting details. . . . This kind of
economic historical analysis is utterly worthless for economics.39

And bearing in mind the etatist bias in the works of the Schmoller
School, Brentano calls it an aberration “to confuse enthusiastic excerpts
from archives with economic investigations and research.”40

THE ECONOMIC DOCTRINES OF SOCIAL LIBERALISM

Faithful to their principle, the Socialists of the Chair did not create a
system of economics, which was the endeavor of the Physiocrats and
classical economists, and now the modern subjectivist economists. The
socialists were not concerned with creating a system of catallactics.
Marx simply adopted the system of the classics and drew the conclusion that, in a society based on the division of labor, there is no
third organizational possibility besides the private property and the
public property orders. He mocked all attempts at a third order as

“bourgeois.” The position of etatism is different. From the start it did
not seek to understand, but to judge. It brought along preconceived
ethical opinions: “It shall be!” and “It shall not be!” All things were
chaotic as long as the state did not intervene. Only government intervention could put an end to the arbitrariness of self-seeking individuals.
The idea that a social order could be based on a constitution under
which the state would do nothing but protect private property in the
means of production seemed utterly absurd to it. It only had ridicule
for the “enemies of the state” who believed in such a “pre-established harmony.” The etatists thought it utterly illogical to reject every
government “intervention” in economic life, as this would lead to
anarchism. If government intervention for the protection of private
property is permissible, it is illogical to reject all further intervention.
The only reasonable economic order is a social order in which private
property exists in name, but actually is abolished, the state holding
the final reins over production and distribution. The state of affairs at
the zenith of liberalism could come into existence only because the
state neglected its duties and granted too much freedom to individuals.
With such a point of view, the development of a catallactic system is
unnecessary, indeed illogical.
The best example for the ideology of the welfare state is the balance
of payments theory. A country may lose all its monetary metal if
the state does not intervene, so runs the older, mercantilist version.
The classical economists demonstrated, however, that the danger so
dreaded by the mercantilists does not exist, because forces are at
work that, in the long run, prevent the loss of money. This is why the
quantity theory was always so objectionable to etatists. They favored
the Banking School. The victory of the Historical School practically
brought excommunication of the Currency School. Karl Marx,41 Adolf
Wagner, Helfferich, Hilferding, Havenstein, and Bendixen held to the
doctrines of the Banking School.
41
Marx did not recognize that by adopting the Banking Principle he acknowledged
the foundation on which Proudhon’s exchange-bank ideas were based. Marx had no clear
conception of banking; in many cases he uncritically followed the Banking Theorists. How
little he understood of the problems is visible in each of the few remarks he added to
the excerpts, as, for instance, on the Catholic character of the monetary system and the
Protestant character of the credit system (Das Kapital, vol. III, pt. II, 3rd ed., Hamburg,
1911, p. 132). Even more characteristic is another remark that connects with the basic
principle of the Banking Principle that “the emission of a certain quantity of one-pound
notes replaces an equal quantity of sovereigns.” According to Marx, “a sleight of hand well
known to all banks!” (Ibid., vol. I, 7th ed., Hamburg, 1914, p. 84.) What is the purpose of
this “sleight of hand”? Banks were not interested in attracting sovereigns through the issue
of notes. They were interested only in granting more credits through the issue of more
notes and thereby raising their interest income. This “sleight of hand” was well known to
banks, but not that mentioned by Marx.

THE ECONOMIC DOCTRINES OF SOCIAL LIBERALISM 61

After two generations of eclecticism and avoidance of clear concepts, many contemporary writers have difficulty recognizing the
differences between those two famous British schools. Thus Palyi
shows surprise that “a resolute follower of the Banking Principle,
M. Ausiaux, occasionally advocates the comptabilism of Solvay.”42 Let
us not overlook the fact that “compatibilism” and all other related systems are logical applications of the Banking Principle. If the banks are
in no position to issue more notes than are necessary (the “elasticity
of circulation”), there can be no objection to the adoption of Solvay’s
monetary reform.
Palyi’s etatist position explains why he could not add a single word
to the old mercantilist observations, and why his whole theory is
limited to pointing at the selfish disposition of the state’s subjects, who
should not be left to themselves.43 Social liberalism could not share
this etatist position. For better or worse it had to show how, according
to its social ideal, the members of an exchange society cooperate
without government assistance. But social liberalism never developed
a comprehensive theory either. Some of its followers probably believed
that the time was not yet ripe on account of insufficient preparation
through collection of material; the majority probably never saw the
need for a comprehensive theory at all. Wherever the need for theory
arose, the social liberals usually borrowed from the classical system,
mostly in the garb of Marxism. In this regard the social liberals differed
from the etatists, who preferred to fall back on the mercantilists.
Nevertheless, social liberalism did seek to make an independent
contribution to theory—a doctrine of wage rates. It could use neither
classical theory nor modern theory. Marx very logically had denied that
collective bargaining of labor unions could raise wages. Only Brentano
and Webb sought to prove that collective bargaining can permanently
raise the income of all workers; this theory is the principal doctrine of
social liberalism. However, it could not withstand a scientific critique,
such as that by Pohle44 and Adolf Weber.45 In his last essay, BöhmBawerk, too, arrived at the same conclusion,46 and no one today dares

seriously represent the Brentano-Webb doctrine. It is significant that
the comprehensive Festschrift honoring Brentano does not contain a
single contribution on wage theory and the wage policies of labor
unions. Cassau merely observes that before the war the labor union
movement worked “without any wage theory.”47
In his review of the first edition of Adolf Weber’s book, Schmoller
responded to the point that it is regularly impossible, without a rise
in productivity, to raise wage rates through the withholding of labor.
According to Schmoller, “such theoretical abstract price discussions”
could lead to no useful results. We can render a “safe judgment” only
“if we can numerically measure these fine complicated processes.”
Adolf Weber sees in such an answer a declaration of bankruptcy of our
science.48 But the etatist need not be concerned with the bankruptcy
of catallactics. In fact, the consistent etatist denies the existence of
any regularity in the process of market phenomena. At any rate, as
politician the etatist knows an escape from the dilemma: the state
determines the level of wages. But the refutation of the Brentano-Webb
doctrine alone is not fatal. Even if we were to accept it—which, as
we pointed out, no one would dare do since the writings of Adolf
Weber, Pohle, and Böhm-Bawerk—the decisive question would still
need an answer. If labor unions actually had the power to raise the
average wage of all workers above the rate that would prevail without
their intervention, the question remains, How high can wages go? Can
average wages go so high that they absorb all “unearned” income and
must be paid out of capital? Or is there a lower limit at which this rise
must stop? This is the problem the “power theory” must answer with
regard to every price. But until today no one has ever tried to solve
the problem.
We must not deal with the power problem by calling authoritative
intervention “impossible,” as did older liberalism. There cannot be
any doubt that labor unions are in the position to raise wage rates as
high as they wish if the state assists them by denying protection to all
workers willing to work, and either pays unemployment compensation
or forces employers to hire workers. But then the following occurs:
The workers in essential enterprises are in the position to extract
any arbitrary wage from the rest of the population. But ignoring even
that, the shifting of the wage boost to consumer prices can be borne

by the workers themselves, but not by capitalists and entrepreneurs
whose incomes did not rise on account of the wage boost. They now
must curtail capital accumulation, or consume less, or even eat into
their capital. What they will do, and to what extent they will do it,
depends on the size of their income reduction. Surely everyone will
agree that it is inconceivable thus to eliminate or merely greatly to
curtail property income without at least reducing or halting capital
formation and very likely consuming capital (after all, there is nothing
in the way of unions that could keep them from raising their demands
to levels that absorb all “unearned” income). But it is obvious that
the consumption of capital does not permanently raise the workers’
wages.
The etatist and social-liberal roads to higher wages of workers
diverge. But neither leads to the goal. As social liberalism cannot
possibly wish to halt or reduce capital formation, much less cause
capital consumption, it finally faces the alternative: either capitalism
or socialism. Tertium non datur (“There is no third road”).

THE CONCEPT AND CRISIS OF SOCIAL POLICY

All the economic policies of the last two generations are designed step
by step to abolish private property in the means of production—if not
in name, then in substance—and to replace the capitalist social order
with a socialistic order. Decades ago Sidney Webb announced it in
his Fabian Essays.49 As the pictures of the desired future social order
varied with the individual branches of socialism, so did their opinions
on the road by which the goal was to be reached. There are questions
on which all branches could agree. In other questions great differences
separated the camps, as, for instance, factory labor by married women,
or protection of handcrafts from the competition of big business. But
they all agreed on the rejection of the social ideal of liberalism. No
matter how they differed from each other, they joined ranks in the
fight against “Manchesterism.” In this point, at least, the champion
Socialists of the Chair saw eye to eye with the champions of social
liberalism.
For the movement toward a gradual replacement of capitalism
by a socialistic or syndicalistic social order, the term “social policy”
slowly gained acceptance. A precise definition of the term was never
offered, as sharp conceptual definitions were never the concern of
49

64 SOCIAL LIBERALISM

the Historical School. The use of the term “social policy” remained
ambiguous. Only in recent years when pressed by economic critique
did the social politicians attempt to define the term.
Sombart probably recognized the nature of social policy most
clearly. “By social policy,” he wrote in 1897, “we understand those
measures of economic policy that effect the preservation, promotion, or
repression of certain economic systems.”50 Amonn rightly found many
faults with this definition, but especially pointed out that measures
should be characterized by their objectives, not by their effects within
the framework of policy, and that social policy goes beyond the realm
that usually is called “economic policy.”51 But it is decisive that Sombart
saw a change in the economic order as the objective of social policy.
Let us bear in mind that when he wrote this, Sombart was standing
firmly on Marxian ground, which made him think of the introduction
of socialism as the only conceivable social policy. We must admit
that he correctly perceived the essential point. The only deficiency
of his definition is his inclusion of all efforts toward a realization
of the liberal program, efforts that were made at a time when, in
the language of Marx, the bourgeoisie was still a revolutionary class.
Similarly, Sombart expressly included the liberation of peasants from
feudal servitude as an example of social policy. Many writers followed
him in this respect. Again and again they sought to define the term
“social policy” in such a way that it would include political measures
other than those aiming at the realization of socialism.52
It makes little sense to deal further with the empty argument on
the concept of social policy, an argument that just recently caught fire.
It was touched off by the crisis that seized socialism and syndicalism
of all varieties upon the victory of the Marxian Social Democrats in
Germany.
Prussian etatism and its intellectual followers in other countries,
had gone as far on the road to socialism as possible without too
much visible damage to the economy and too great a reduction in
the productivity of labor. No one whose vision is unclouded by party
politics can deny that Prussia-Germany of the prewar era was more
suited than any other country before or since to conduct socialistic

It is characteristic that the Historical School, which otherwise knows only of historical
categories, seeks to define the concept of social policy so that they may speak also of old
Babylonian and Aztecan social policy.

THE CONCEPT AND CRISIS OF SOCIAL POLICY 65

experiments. The tradition of Prussian officialdom, the faith of all
educated people in the calling of the state, the military-hierarchic
classification of the population, its inclination to blindly obey the
authorities, all provided the prerequisites for socialism given nowhere
else. Never can there be men more suited for the management of a
socialistic communal operation than the mayors of German cities or
the directors of the Prussian railroad. They did everything possible to
make communal enterprises work. If, in spite of these advantages the
system failed, it proved conclusively that the system just cannot be
realized.
Suddenly the Social Democrats came to power in Germany and
Austria. For many decades they had announced time and again that
their genuine socialism had nothing in common with the false socialism
of the etatists, and that they would proceed completely differently
from the bureaucrats and professors. Now was the time to demonstrate
what they could do. But they could not come up with anything new
except the term “socialization.” In 1918 and 1919, all political parties
in Germany and Austria added the socialization of suitable industries
to their programs. At that time no step on the way to pure socialism of
the Marxian variety met serious resistance. Even so, what was realized
did not exceed in direction or scope that which the Socialists of the
Chair had recommended earlier, or in many cases had already tried.
Only a few day-dreamers in Munich believed that the example of
Lenin and Trotsky in agrarian Russia could be emulated in industrial
Germany without causing an unprecedented crisis.
Socialism did not fail because of ideological resistance—the prevailing ideology is socialistic even today. It failed because of its unrealizability. As the general awareness grew that every step taking us away
from the private property order always reduced labor’s productivity,
and so brought want and misery, it became necessary not only to halt
the advance to socialism, but even to repeal some of the socialistic
measures already taken. Even the Soviets had to yield. They did not
proceed with the socialization of land, but merely distributed the land
to the rural population. In trade and commerce they replaced pure
socialism with the “New Economic Policy.” However, the ideology did
not participate in this retreat. It stubbornly clung to its pronouncements of decades ago, and sought to explain the failures of socialism
in all possible ways except the right one—its basic unrealizability.
Only a few champions of socialism have realized that the failure of
socialism was not coincidental, but inevitable. Some went even further
and admitted that all social measures reduce productivity, consume

66 SOCIAL LIBERALISM

capital and wealth, and are destructive. The renunciation of the ideals
these men used to embrace is called in economic literature the crisis
of social policy.53 In reality, it is much more: it is the great world crisis
of destructionism—the policy that seeks to destroy the social order
based on private property in the means of production.
The world can support teeming humanity in the manner in which it
has been supported in recent decades only if men work capitalistically.
Only capitalism can be expected to further raise the productivity of
human labor. The fact that the vast majority of people adheres to an
ideology that refuses to admit this, and therefore conducts policies
that lead to a reduction of labor productivity and consumption of
capital, is the essence of the great cultural crisis.

MAX WEBER AND THE SOCIALISTS OF THE CHAIR

The opposition that arose in Germany against the Socialists of the Chair
generally started with an awareness that theoretical investigations of
economic problems are essential. As economists, Dietzel, Julius Wolf,
Ehrenberg, Pohle, Adolf Weber, Passow, and others rose against the
Socialists of the Chair. On the other hand, historians raised objections
against the manner in which Schmoller, Knapp, and his pupils sought
to solve historical tasks. Equipped with the tools of their sciences,
these critics approached the doctrines of the Socialists of the Chair
from the outside. Of course the Socialists of the Chair, with their great
prestige and important positions, made it difficult for the critics; but
the encounter presented no problem of conscience to them. They either
had never been under the spell of socialism, or had freed themselves
from it without difficulty.
It was quite different with Max Weber. To the younger Max Weber,
the ideas of Prussian etatism, the Socialism of the Chair, and evangelical social reform had meant everything. He had absorbed them before
he had begun to deal scientifically with the problems of socialism.
Religious, political, and ethical considerations had determined his
position.
Max Weber’s university training was in law; his early scientific
works dealt with legal history. He began as an unsalaried lecturer
and became professor of law. His inclination was for history, not the
historical research of particulars that is lost in details and overlooks the
53
See Pribram, “Die Wandlungen des Begriffes der Sozialpolitik” [The changes in the
concept of social policy], vol. II, p. 249.

MAX WEBER AND THE SOCIALISTS OF THE CHAIR 67

whole, but universal history, historical synthesis, and the philosophy
of history.
To him, history was no goal in itself, but a means toward gaining
more profound political insights. Economics was alien to him. He
was appointed professor of economics without having dealt with this
science before, which was a customary procedure at that time.54 It
reflected the Empirical-Realistic School’s opinion on the nature of
“social sciences” and on the scientific expertise of legal historians.
Just before his untimely death Weber regretted that his knowledge of
modern theoretical economics and the classical system was too limited.
He mentioned his fear that time would not permit him to fill these
regrettable gaps.
When he accepted the position, he was obliged to give lectures
on those problems which the Socialists of the Chair considered the
proper subject matter for university teaching. But Weber found no
satisfaction in the prevailing doctrine. The jurist and historian in him
rebelled against the manner in which the School treated legal and
historical problems. This is why he began his pioneering methodological and epistemological investigations. It led him to the problems of
materialistic philosophy of history, from which he then approached
the religious-sociological tasks. He proceeded finally to a grandiose
attempt at a system of social sciences.
But all these studies, step by step, led Max Weber away from the
political and social ideals of his youth. He moved, for the first time,
toward liberalism, rationalism, utilitarianism. It was a painful personal
experience, not different from that of many other scholars breaking
away from Christianity. Indeed, his faith and religion were Prussian
etatism; breaking away from it was like desertion from hope, his own
people, indeed, from European civilization.
As it became clear to him that the prevailing social ideology was
untenable, and as he saw where it was bound to lead he began
to see the future of the German nation and the other nations that
carry European civilization. In a way, as the cauchemar des coalitions (“nightmare of coalitions”) deprived Bismarck of his sleep, so
the recognition to which his studies led him gave Weber no rest.
No matter how he clung to the hope that everything would work
out in the end, a dark premonition told him again and again that a
catastrophe was approaching. This awareness gnawed at his health,
54

exaggeration that he is listening to great economic lectures, given by himself.” Marianne

68 SOCIAL LIBERALISM

filled him with growing uneasiness after the outbreak of the World
War, urged him on to activity that for a man unwanted by any of
the political parties had to remain fruitless, and finally hastened his
death.
From its beginning in Heidelberg, the life of Max Weber was an
uninterrupted inner struggle against the doctrines of the Socialism
of the Chair. But he did not fight this struggle to the end; he died
before he succeeded in completely freeing himself from the spell of
these doctrines. He died lonely, without intellectual heirs who could
continue the fight he had to give up in death. To be sure, his name
is praised, but the true substance of his work is not recognized, and
that which was most important to him has found no disciples. Only
opponents have recognized the dangers to their own ideology from
the thoughts of Max Weber.55

THE FAILURE OF THE PREVAILING IDEOLOGY

In all variations and colors the ideas of socialism and syndicalism have
lost their scientific moorings. Their champions have been unable to
set forth another system more compatible with their teachings and
thereby refute the charge of emptiness by the theoretical economists.
Therefore, they had to deny fundamentally the possibility of theoretical
knowledge in the field of social science and, especially, in economics.
In their denial they were content with a few critical objections to the
foundation of theoretical economics. But their methodological critique
as well as their objections to various theories have proven to be utterly
untenable. Nothing, absolutely nothing has remained of what half a
century ago Schmoller, Brentano, and their friends used to proclaim
as the new science. The fact that studies in economic history can be
very instructive, and that they should be undertaken, had been known
before, and had never been denied.
Even during the zenith of the Historical School theoretical economics did not remain idle. The birthday of modern subjectivist theory
coincided with the foundation of the Association for Social Policy. Since
then, economics and social policy have confronted each other. The
social scientists do not even know the foundation of the theoretical
system, and have taken no notice of the significant development of

THE FAILURE OF THE PREVAILING IDEOLOGY 69

theoretical knowledge in recent decades. Wherever they sought to
deal with it critically, they could not get beyond the old errors already
fully dealt with by Menger and Böhm-Bawerk.
But all this has not weakened the socialistic and syndicalistic ideology. Today, it is swaying the minds of people more than ever before.
The great political and economic events in recent years are seen almost
exclusively from its viewpoint, though of course it has failed here also.
What Cassau said about the ideology of proletarian socialism applies
also to that of Socialism of the Chair: All experiences of the last decade
“passed by the ideology without influencing it. Never did it have more
opportunities for expansion, and scarcely ever has it been as sterile as during the debates on socialization.”56 The ideology is sterile,
and yet it is reigning. Even in Great Britain and the United States,
classical liberalism is losing ground every day. To be sure, there are
characteristic differences between the teachings of German etatism
and Marxism on the one hand, and the new doctrine of salvation in
the United States on the other. The phraseology of the Americans is
more carefully worded than that of Schmoller, Held, or Brentano. But
the Americans’ aspirations basically concur with the doctrines of the
Socialists of the Chair. They also share the mistaken belief that they
are upholding the private property order.
When, by and large, socialism and syndicalism are in a stagnate
state, when we notice some retreating steps on the road to socialism
are taken, when thought is given to a limitation of labor union power,
the credit can be given neither to the scientific perception of economics
nor the prevailing sociology. For but a few dozen individuals all over
the globe are cognizant of economics, and no statesman or politician
cares about it. The social ideology even of those political parties that
call themselves “middle class,” is totally socialistic, etatistic, syndicalistic. If, nevertheless, socialism and syndicalism are languishing,
although the prevailing ideology is demanding further progress, it
is solely due to the all-too-visible decline in labor productivity as a
result of every restrictive measure. Swayed by the socialistic ideologies,
everyone is searching for excuses for the failure, and not for the cause.
Nevertheless, the net result has been greater caution in economic
policy.
Politics does not dare introduce what the prevailing ideology is
demanding. Taught by bitter experience, it subconsciously has lost
confidence in the prevailing ideology. In this situation, no one, however,
56

Cassau, op. cit., vol. I, p. 152.

70 SOCIAL LIBERALISM

is giving thought to replacing the obviously useless ideology with a
useful one. No help is expected from reason. Some are taking refuge in
mysticism, others are setting their hopes on the coming of the “strong
man”—the tyrant who will think for them and care for them.

ANTI - MARXISM

1

In postwar Germany and Austria, a movement has been steadily gaining significance in politics and the social sciences that can best be
described as Anti-Marxism. Occasionally its followers also use this
label.* Their point of departure, their mode of thinking and fighting,
and their goals are by no means uniform. The principal tie that unites
them is their declaration of hostility toward Marxism. Mind you, they
are not attacking socialism, but Marxism, which they reproach for not
being the right kind of socialism, for not being the one that is true and
desirable. It would also be a serious mistake to assert, as do the noisy
Social-Democrat and Communist party literati, that this Anti-Marxism
approves of or in any way defends capitalism and private property
in the means of production. No matter what train of thought it may
pursue, it is no less anticapitalistic than Marxist.
Only scientific Anti-Marxism is discussed in what follows. The
Anti-Marxism of practical politics will be touched upon only insofar
as it is absolutely essential for an understanding of the intellectual
movement.

MARXISM IN GERMAN SCIENCE

Usually only those writers can be called Marxists who, as members
of a Marxian party, are obliged to indicate approval in their writings
of the Marxian doctrines as canonized by party conventions. Their
scholarship can be no more than “scholasticism.” Their writings aim at
preserving the “purity” of the true doctrine, and their proofs consist
of quotations from authorities—in the final analysis Marx and Engels.
Again and again they conclude that “bourgeois” science has completely
collapsed, and that truth can be sought only in Marxism. Every piece of
writing then closes with the reassuring remark that in the future socialistic paradise all social problems will find a very satisfactory solution.
These Marxian writings are significant only inasmuch as they have
promoted the careers of their authors. They have nothing whatsoever

71

72 ANTI - MARXISM

to do with science, and, as shall be shown, not even with German
science that is so greatly influenced by the doctrines of Marx. Not
a single thought has emerged from the voluminous writings of the
epigones. Nothing remains but horrible waste and incessant repetition.
The great struggles that shook the Marxian parties—on revisionism,
dictatorship, et cetera—were not scientific; they were purely political
discussions. The scientific methods used to conduct them were wholly
barren in the eyes of every nonscholastic. Only Marx and Engels, not
one of their epigones, have affected German science.
During the 1870s and 1880s State and Chair Socialism came to
power in Germany. Classical economics had left the stage. The Austrians, scorned as eccentrics, were the only writers who contributed to
modern economics, which, like Western sociology,* at first remained
wholly unknown. Besides, both were suspected of Manchesterism.
Only historical and descriptive-statistical compositions were permissible, and a “social” conviction, i.e., Socialism of the Chair, was the
most important requirement for scholarly recognition. In spite of, and
perhaps because of, this affinity, the Socialists of the Chair opposed
Social Democracy. They barely paid attention to Marx and Engels, who
were considered too “doctrinaire.”
This began to change when a new generation came along, pupils
of the men who, in 1872, had founded the Association for Social Policy.
This generation had never been exposed to university lectures on
theoretical economics. It knew the classical economists by name only
and was convinced that they had been vanquished by Schmoller. Very
few had ever read or even seen the works of Ricardo or Mill. But they
had to read Marx and Engels, which became all the more necessary
as they had to cope with the growing Social Democracy. They were
writing books in order to refute Marx. As a result of such efforts, they
themselves, and their readers, fell under the influence of Marxian
ideas. Because of their ignorance in all economic and sociological
theory, they were utterly defenseless against the doctrines of Marx.
They rejected the harshest political demands of Marx and Engels, but
adopted the theories in milder form.
This Marxism of the pupils soon reacted on the teachers. In his
article “Economy, Economics and Economic Method,”2 Schmoller mentions that Jevons “correctly” said of Ricardo that “he put the wagon

later called praxeology, the general theory of human action.

social sciences], 3rd ed., vol. VIII, p. 426.

MARXISM IN GERMAN SCIENCE 73

of political economy on the wrong track.” With visible satisfaction
Schmoller then adds that Hasbach observed that “it was the very
track which the English bourgeoisie wanted to take.” For a long time
during the fight of the German Historical School against the narrowmindedness of Ricardo, Schmoller continues “many followers of the
old school” believed they were walking in the methodological footsteps of Adam Smith. Thus many were not aware “that their theories had become narrow class doctrines.”3 Socialism, according to
Schmoller, can be denied “neither justification for existence nor some
good effects.” “Born as a philosophy of social misery, it represents
a branch of science that suits the interests of workers, in the same
way as the post-Adam Smith natural philosophy had become a theory
serving the interests of capitalists.”4
We can clearly see how strongly Marxian notions have permeated
Schmoller’s ideas of the historical development of economic systems.
They are even stronger with Lexis, whose interest theory, according to
Engels, is “merely a paraphrase of that of Marx.”5 Böhm-Bawerk, who
agreed with this Engels judgment, observed (in 1900) that Dietzel’s
and Stolzmann’s interest theories are also closely related to Lexis’
opinion, and that we often encounter similar thoughts and pronouncements in contemporary economic literature as well. It seems to be “a
trend of thought that is coming into fashion.”6
In economics, this fashion did not last too long. For the generation
of men who had been the pupils of the founders of the younger
Historical School, Marx was the economic theorist par excellence. But
when some pupils of these pupils began to turn their attention to the
problems of theoretical economics, Marx’s reputation as a theorist
quickly vanished. Finally, the achievements of theoretical economics
abroad and in Austria during the last two decades were recognized in
Germany; and it was seen how small and insignificant a position Marx
occupies in the history of economics.
However, the influence of Marxism on German sociology has continued to grow. In sociology, more so than in economics, the Germans
ignored the achievements of the West. As they began rather late to deal
with sociological problems they knew only one ideology: the Marxian

philosophy of history and the doctrine of class warfare. It became
the starting point for German sociological thought and, through the
problems it posed, greatly influenced even those writers who strove
to reject it most vigorously. The majority did not repudiate the doctrine itself, but merely its political and practical consequences. In
most cases they characterized the Marxian doctrine either as exaggerated, or going too far, or too one-sided, and therefore sought to
complete it by adding new racial and nationalistic doctrines. The
basic insufficiency of the Marxian set of problems and the failure of
all attempts at solving them were not seen at all. They embarked
upon historical research into the origin of the Marxian social philosophy, but ignored those few possibly defensible thoughts earlier
elaborated much more concisely in France and England by such men
as Taine and Buckle. Moreover, their main interest then focused upon
a problem utterly insignificant for science—the famous doctrine of
the “withering away” of the state. In this case, as with many of their
other doctrines, Marx and Engels merely meant to find a slogan for
agitation. On the one hand they wanted to fight anarchism, and on
the other hand they sought to demonstrate that the “nationalization”
of the means of production demanded by socialism had nothing in
common with the nationalization and municipalization demanded
by state and municipal socialism. It was understandable from the
po[i]nt of view of party politics that the etatist critique of Marxism
aimed especially at this point. It seemed so inviting to reveal the inner
contradiction of the Marxian social doctrine, and to confront “the
enemies of the state,” Marx and Engels, with a believer in the state,
Lassalle.7
The fact that German science had rejected the utilitarian social
doctrine of the eighteenth century explains the success of Marxian
social doctrine in Germany.
The theological-metaphysical social doctrine explains and postulates society from a point of view that lies beyond human experience.
God, or “nature,” or an objective value, want society in a certain
form to reach a desired destiny. Man must follow this command. It
is assumed that submission to the social body imposes sacrifices on
the individual, for which he will receive no compensation other than
the awareness that he has acted well, and perhaps will be rewarded
in another world. The theological doctrines and some metaphysical
doctrines trust that providence will guide willing men on their proper
7

MARXISM IN GERMAN SCIENCE 75

paths, and force the recalcitrants through blessed men or institutions
acting on behalf of the reigning God.
Individualism opposes such a social doctrine. It demands to know
from both the religious and the metaphysical positions why the individual is to be sacrificed to society. The ensuing argument that touches
the foundation of the theological-metaphysical social philosophy, corresponds to the distinction so popular in Germany between the collectivistic (universalistic) social doctrine and the individualistic doctrine.8
But it is a crucial mistake to believe that this classification has made
room for all conceivable social doctrines. It has especially failed to
affect modern social philosophy that was built on eighteenth century
utilitarianism.
The utilitarian social doctrine does not engage in metaphysics, but
takes as its point of departure the established fact that all living beings
affirm their will to live and grow. The higher productivity of labor
performed in division of labor, when compared with isolated action,
is ever more uniting individuals to association. Society is division
and association of labor. In the final analysis, there is no conflict of
interest between society and the individual, as everyone can pursue
his interests more efficiently in society than in isolation. The sacrifices
the individual makes to society are merely temporary, surrendering a
small advantage in order to attain a greater one. This is the essence of
the often cited doctrine of the harmony of interests.
The etatistic and socialistic critique never understood the “preestablished harmony” of the free trade school from Smith to Bastiat. Its
theological appearance is not essential for the doctrine. Utilitarian
sociology seeks to explain the development of society since man’s
presumably hermitic existence in prehistoric times, or since his less
developed cooperation in known history. It seeks to explain man’s
social ties throughout history, and hopefully his future progress toward
association, from principles that are active in each individual. In accordance with teleological considerations, association is thought to be
“good” and laudable. A faithful soul seeking an understanding of social
development views the principle of association as a wise arrangement
of God. It could not be different: goodness, namely, the division of
labor now and in the future, emanates from human nature. It follows that the division of labor is a good means in view of its good

results, even if from different points of view it should be viewed as evil,
weak, or deficient. To Adam Smith, even the weakness of man was not
“without its utility.” And he concludes: “Every part of nature, when
attentively surveyed, equally demonstrates the providential care of its
Author; and we may admire the wisdom and goodness of God even in
the weakness and folly of men.”9 Obviously, the theistic tone is only an
appendage, which could readily be replaced by the term “nature,” as
Smith does in other passages of his book where he speaks of “the great
Director of Nature” or just of “nature.” The social doctrines of Smith
and Kant do not differ in basic attitudes and views. Kant, too, tries to
explain how “nature” guides man to the goal it has set for him. The
only difference between Smith and Kant consists of the fact that Smith
has succeeded in reducing the formation of society to factors whose
presence in man can be proven empirically, while Kant can explain
society only through an assumption of man’s “inclination” to associate
and a second inclination to disassociate, from the antagonism of which
society emerges. How it does so is not elaborated.10
Every teleological view can be dressed in a theistic garb without
any change in its scientific character. For instance, Darwin’s doctrine
of natural selection can easily be presented in such a way that the
struggle for survival becomes a wise arrangement by the Creator for the
development of species. And every teleological view reveals harmonies
to us, that is, how that which stands at the end of the development
process emerges from the acting forces. The fact that the conditions
cooperate harmoniously only signifies that they lead to the effect we
are to explain. If we desist from calling a given state of affairs “good,”
all tenets of the doctrine stay intact. The explanation of how a certain
state “necessarily” had to result from given conditions that cannot be
analyzed further, is independent of how we may value this state. The
attacks on the thought of “preestablished harmony” do not touch the
substance, merely the wording, of the utilitarian social theory.
Without change in substance, the social doctrine of Marxism, too,
can be understood as one announcing a preestablished harmony. The
dialectics of social reality necessarily lead the way from the primeval
world to the goal, the socialistic paradise. The unsatisfactory part of
this doctrine is its content; the wording again is unimportant.

The opponents of utilitarian social theory like to taunt it for its
“rationalism.” But every scientific explanation is rationalistic. Whatever
the human mind cannot comprehend, the tools of science cannot
conquer. This criticism often ignores the fact that liberal social theory
does not explain formation and progress of social ties and institutions
as consciously aimed human efforts toward the formation of societies,
as the naive versions of the contract theory explain them. It views
social organizations “as the unconsidered result of specific individual
efforts of the members of society.”11
The misunderstanding that prevails with regard to the harmony
doctrine is repeated in a different form regarding property. We can
either hold to the opinion that the private property order is the superior
form of social organization—that is, we can be liberals—or we can
believe that the public property order is superior—that is, we can be
socialists. But he who adheres to the former embraces the doctrine
that the private property order serves the interests of all members of
society, not just those of owners.12
We proceed from the position that there are no insoluble conflicts
of interest within the private property order, even to the recognition
that warlike behavior becomes rarer as the scope and intensity of
social association grows. Wars, foreign and domestic (revolutions,
civil wars), are more likely to be avoided the closer the division of
labor binds men. The belligerent creature, man, becomes industrial,
the “hero” becomes a “trader.” The democratic institutions serve to
eliminate violent action within the state, as they seek to maintain or
achieve agreement between the wills of those who govern and those
who are governed.
In contrast to the utilitarians who believe that the private property
order assures greater labor productivity, the older socialists were convinced that it was the public property system that could bring higher
productivity, which necessitated the abolition of the private property
order. We must distinguish this utilitarian socialism from the socialism
that takes as its starting point a theistic or metaphysical social theory,

methods of social sciences], Leipzig, 1883, p. 178. [English-language edition: Problems
of Economics and Sociology (Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1963).] F. v. Wieser’s
critique of the rationalistic-utilitarian doctrine in general, and of Menger’s formulation
in particular, leaves its substance untouched (See Wieser, Theorie der gesellschaftlichen
Wirtschaft [Theory of social economics], Tübingen, 1914, sec. I, p. 242 et seq.). Its significance lies in its distinction between leader and masses—probably under the influence
of Tarde—and in its greater emphasis on the principle of heterogeneity of objectives—as
Wundt called it.

and that demands a command system because it is more suited to
realize empirically unproven values which society is to adopt.
The socialism of Marx fundamentally differs from these two varieties of socialism, which he calls “utopian.” To be sure, Marx also
assumes that the socialistic method of production yields higher labor
productivity than the private property order. But he denies that a
solidarity of interest exists or has ever existed in society. A solidarity
of interest, according to Marx, can exist only within each class. But a
conflict of interest exists between the classes, which explains why the
history of all societies has been a history of class wars.
Conflict is the moving force of social development to yet another
group of social doctrines. For those doctrines the war of races and
nations constitute the basic law of society.
The common error of both groups of warfare sociology is their
disregard of any principle of association. They endeavor to show
why there must be war between the classes, races, and nations. But
they neglect to show why there is, or can be, peace and cooperation
between the classes, races, and nations. The reason for this negligence
is not difficult to detect. It is impossible to demonstrate a principle
of association that exists within a collective group only, and that is
inoperative beyond it. If war and strife are the driving force of all social
development, why should this be true for classes, races, and nations
only, and not for war among all individuals? If we take this warfare
sociology to its logical conclusion we arrive at no social doctrine at all,
but at “a theory of unsociability.”13
None of this could be understood in Germany, Hungary, and the
Slavic countries because of a basic hostility toward all utilitarian
thought right from the start. Because modern sociology is based on
utilitarianism and the doctrine of the division of labor, it was rejected
summarily. This is the main reason for the reluctance of German
scholars to cope with sociology, and for the struggle they waged so
tenaciously for decades against sociology as a science. Since sociology
was not welcome, a substitute had to be found. Depending on their
political position they adopted one of the two “theories of unsociability”
which emphasized the warfare principle, and completely bypassed any
search for a principle of association.
This scientific situation explains the success Marxian sociology was
able to achieve in Germany and in the East. When compared with
the doctrines of racial and national warfare it had the advantage of
13
Barth, Die Philosophie der Geschichte als Soziologie [The philosophy of history as
sociology], 3rd ed., Leipzig, 1922, p. 260.

MARXISM IN GERMAN SCIENCE 79

offering, at least for the distant future, a social order with a coherent
principle of association. Its answer was ever so much more acceptable
because it was optimistic and more satisfactory for some readers than
those doctrines which offered nothing in history but a hopeless struggle
of a noble race against a supremacy of inferior races. He who sought
to go even further in his optimism and was less exacting scientifically,
found the solution to the conflict not just in the socialistic paradise of
the future, but already in the “social kingdom.”
Marxism thus swayed German thought in sociology and philosophy
of history.
Popular German sociology adopted, above all, the class concept
that is so basic to Marxian sociology. Spann correctly observed: “Today,
even so-called middle-class economists are using the term ‘class’ in
such a way and in connection with such questions as are raised by
the historical materialism of Marx.”14 Adoption of this concept was
accompanied by the Marx and Engels characteristics of uncertainty,
vagueness, and obscurity, further echoed by the Social-Democrat and
Communist parties. During the thirty-five years between the publication of the Communist Manifesto and his death, Marx did not succeed
in somehow defining the concept of class struggle more precisely. And
it is significant that the posthumous manuscript of the third volume
of Das Kapital halts abruptly at the very place that was to deal with
classes. Since his death more than forty years have passed, and the
class struggle has become the cornerstone of modern German sociology.
And yet we continue to await its scientific definition and delineation.
No less vague are the concepts of class interests, class condition, and
class war, and the ideas on the relationship between conditions, class
interests, and class ideology.
For Marx and his parties, the interests of the individual classes
are irreconcilably opposed to each other. Each class knows precisely
what its class interests are and how to realize them. Therefore, there
can only be warfare, or at best an armistice. The thought that some
circumstances may call an end to the struggle before the socialistic
bliss is realized, or that circumstances may moderate it, is rejected
summarily. There is no greater entity that could encompass the classes
and dissolve the class conflicts. The ideas of fatherland, nation, race,
and humanity are mere disguises for the only real fact, which is
the class conflict. However, popular sociology does not go so far. It
could be as Marx describes it, but it need not be so, and above all,
14
O. Spann, “Klasse und Stand” [Class and estate], Handwörterbuch, 4th ed., vol. V,
p. 692.

80 ANTI - MARXISM

it should not be that way. Selfish class interests must be set aside
in order to serve the interests of nation, fatherland, state. And the
state, as a principle of reason above the classes, as realization of the
idea of justice, must intervene and bring about a social condition in
which the ownership class is prevented from exploiting the nonowners,
so that the class struggle of proletarians against owners becomes
superfluous.
With the doctrine of class warfare, German etatist sociologists
adopted the most important part of the Marxian philosophy of history. To them, the British parliamentary system with all its democratic
institutions, of which liberal doctrine is singing praises, are mere
expressions of the class supremacy of the bourgeoisie. As the Germans
interpret contemporary British history, the British state and its institutions are more reprehensible for being capitalistic and plutocratic. The
British concept of liberty is contrasted with the German concept. They
view the great French revolution and the movements of the 1830s and
1840s as class movements of the bourgeoisie. The fact that the principalities prevailed over the 1848 rebels in Germany is hailed as most
fortunate, as it paved the way for the social rule of the Hohenzollern
kaisers standing above classes and parties. To German etatists and
Marxists, the modern imperialism of the allied powers springs from
the capitalistic propensity to expand. The etatists also adopted a good
part of the Marxian superstructure theory when they depicted classical
economics as a handmaiden of the class interests of entrepreneurs and
the bourgeoisie. An example given above illustrates how this applied
even to Schmoller.
It should be noted that no critical examination preceeded the
adoption of the basic Marxian doctrines. The attention of etatists was
directed primarily at blunting the Marxian attack on the state ideology
and its political offshoots during Prussian leadership in Germany, and
at rendering the Marxian doctrines useful for the ideas of state socialism and conservatism. Etatists did not see the Marxian problem as a
scientific problem, but as a political, or at best, an economic problem.
In politics they contented themselves with charging Marxism with
exaggerations, and sought to demonstrate that there is yet another
solution, indeed, a better solution: social reform. Their main attack
on Marxism did not aim at its economic program, but at its political
program: it placed class interests above national interests.
Only a few comprehended that the problems raised by Marxism
were scientific in nature. Sombart was one of the first who as continuator, renovator, and reformer set out to reshape the Marxian doctrines.

NATIONAL

His new work, which afforded me the occasion for this essay, provides
me with the opportunity to deal with him in detail.
Dependence on Marx is the special characteristic of German social
sciences. Surely Marxism has left its traces as well on the social thinking of France, Great Britain, the United States, the Scandinavian
countries, and the Netherlands. But the influence that emanated from
Marxian doctrines was incomparably greater in Germany. The fact
that the sociology of utilitarianism was generally rejected in Germany
undoubtedly offers an explanation for this great influence.15 In Italy
also, the influence of Marxism was rather significant, although not so
strong as in Germany. But in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, and in the
Slavic countries, it was even greater than in Germany—that is, it was
greater in countries that completely depended on German thought in
spite of their political hostility. Marxism had swayed Russian social
thought, that is, not only the thinking of the followers of the revolutionary parties openly fighting czarism, but also the imperial Russian
universities. Altschul, the translator of Gelesnoff’s Fundamental Economics, correctly observed in his preface to the German edition, “In
no other country did Marx’s economic doctrines invade university
teaching so quickly and influence it so significantly as in Russia.”16 In
its hatred of liberalism and democracy czarism itself paved the way
for the Bolshevist ideology through its promotion of Marxism.

Marxian socialism is beckoning: “Class war, not national war!” It is
proclaiming: “Never again [imperialistic] war.” But it is adding in
thought: “Civil war forever, revolution.”
National socialism is beckoning: “National unity! Peace among
classes!” And it is adding in thought: “War on the foreign enemy!”17

If in the United States the influence of the antiutilitarians (e.g., that of Veblen) should
spread, Marxism, too, will spread with all its consequences.

We must not search for ideas of national socialism just within the National Socialist
Party, which is merely a part—in questions of party tactics an especially radical part—of
the greater movement of national socialism that comprises all people’s parties. The most
eminent literary spokesmen for national socialism are Oswald Spengler and Othmar Spann.
A short and very instructive summary of the ideas of national socialism is contained in
the program of the Greater German People’s Party of Austria written by Otto Conrad,

[Guidelines for German policy. Program principles of the greater German people’s party],
Vienna, 1920.

82 ANTI - MARXISM

These solutions distill the ideas which are dividing the German
nation into two hostile camps.
The great political problem of Germany is the national one. It
appears in three different forms: as the problem of the linguistically
mixed territories at the borders of German settlement in Europe, as
the problem of German emigration (a creation of German settlements
overseas), and as the problem of foreign trade that must provide the
material support for the German population.
Marxism did not see these problems at all. It could say only that in
the socialistic paradise of the future there will be no national struggle.
“National hatred is transformed class hatred,” its holder is “the middle
class,” its beneficiary the “bourgeoisie,” proclaim the party literati.18
How could there be national conflicts after class distinctions and
exploitation have been abolished?
The national problem is a world political problem, the greatest
world problem in the foreseeable future. It concerns all nations, not
just the German nation. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when the English and French formulated modern political doctrines, it had a different meaning for them than it has today. The first
civilized country for which the national problem became important in
its present form was Germany. It should have been the task of German
political theory to deal with it and find a solution through practical
politics. The British and French did not know all those problems of
nationalism for which the formula of national self-determination does
not suffice. German politics did face these problems for decades, and
should have met the challenge by finding a solution. But German
theory and practice could only proclaim the principle of force and
struggle. Its application isolated the German nation from the world,
and led to its defeat in the Great War.
Where the areas in which the German people settled meet with
those occupied by the Danes, Lithuanians, Poles, Czechs, Hungarians,
Croats, Slovaks, Italians, and French, the population borders are not
clearly marked out. In wide sections the peoples are mixed, and individual linguistic islands, especially urban centers, reach far into foreign
areas. Here the formula of “self-determination of nations” no longer
suffices. For here are national minorities who fall under foreign rule if
the majority principle determines political government. If the state is a
liberal state under the rule of law, merely protecting the property and
personal safety of its citizens, the alien rule is less palpable. It is felt
18

NATIONAL

( ANTI - MARXIAN ) SOCIALISM 83

more keenly the more society is governed, the more the state becomes
a welfare state, the more etatism and socialism gain a footing.
For the German nation a violent solution to the problem is least
satisfactory. If Germany, a nation surrounded by other nations in the
heart of Europe, were to assault in accordance with this principle, it
would invite a coalition of all its neighbors into a world-political constellation: enemies all around. In such a situation Germany could find
only one ally: Russia, which is facing hostility by Poles, Lithuanians,
Hungarians, and possibly Czechs, but nowhere stands in direct conflict
with German interests. Since Bolshevist Russia, like Czarist Russia,
only knows force in dealing with other nations, it is already seeking
the friendship of German nationalism. German Anti-Marxism and Russian Super-Marxism are not too far apart. But various attempts at
reconciling German Anti-Marxian nationalism with the Anti-Marxian
nationalism of Fascist Italy must fail in dealing with South Tirol, just
as a reconciliation of Hungarian chauvinism must fail in dealing with
the West-Hungarian problem.
A violent solution to the question of border Germans would be
less acceptable for the German nation itself than for its neighbors,
even if there were prospects for its realization. In fact, Germany, even
if victorious on all sides, would need to be prepared for war at any
time, would have to brace itself for another war of submission through
starvation, and would have to prepare its economy for such an eventuality. This would impose a burden which, in the long run, could not be
borne without serious consequences.
The trade problem, which Germany needed to solve during the
nineteenth century, grew from a worldwide shifting of production to
areas with more favorable production conditions. If there had been
complete freedom of movement, a part of the German population
would have emigrated, for German agriculture and some branches of
industry could no longer compete with newly opened, more fertile
countries offering more favorable production conditions. For national
political reasons Germany sought to prevent this emigration through
tariff policies. We cannot elaborate here why this attempt was doomed
to failure.19
The migration problem is the third form of the practical political
problem for Germany. Germany lacks territory for its excess population.
And again, the prewar theory of German nationalism discovered no
better solution than violence through conquest of suitable territory.
19
I sought to explain it in my book Nation, Staat und Wirtschaft [Nation, state, and
economy], Vienna, 1919, p. 45 et seq.

84 ANTI - MARXISM

In Europe, tens of millions of people live poorly who would do
much better in America and Australia. The difference in the living conditions between a European and his descendants overseas continues
to grow. European emigrants could find overseas what their native
countries failed to offer: a place at the banquet of nature. But they are
too late. The descendants of those who, one, two, or three generations
ago chose the New World over Europe, do not welcome them. The
organized laborers of the United States and the British Commonwealth
countries permit no addition of new competitors. Their labor union
movement is not aimed at employers, as the Marxian doctrine prescribes; they are waging their “class war” against European workers
whose immigration would reduce the marginal productivity of labor,
and thus wage rates. The labor unions of the Anglo-Saxon countries
favored participation in the Great War in order to eliminate the last
remnants of the liberal doctrine of free movement and migration of
labor. This was their war objective, which they adhered to completely.
Countless Germans living abroad were uprooted, deprived of their
possessions and earnings, and “repatriated.” Today, strict laws either
prohibit or limit immigration not only to the United States, but even to
important European areas. And the labor unions of the United States
and Australia unhesitatingly would favor a new, more horrible and
bloody world war if it should become necessary to defend the immigration restrictions against an aggressor, such as the Japanese or a
rearmed Germany.
Here are insurmountable difficulties for the Marxian doctrines
and the policy of the Communist International. Theorists sought to
escape the difficulties by not mentioning them. It is characteristic
that the copious prewar German literature on economic and social
policy, which again and again dealt with the same matter in tiring
detail, contains no work that could explain the policy of immigration
restrictions. And abroad only a few writers dared touch a topic that
obviously did not harmonize with the doctrine of the workers’ class
solidarity.20 This silence, better than anything else, reveals the Marxian
bias in social literature, especially German literature. When, finally,
the international conventions of socialists could no longer escape
dealing with this question, they skillfully circumvented it. Let us, for
instance, read the minutes of the International Convention of Socialists
in Stuttgart, in 1907. It adopted a lame resolution characterized by
20
The most comprehensive treatment is given by Prato, Il proteezionismo operaio, Turin,

in Germany.

NATIONAL

the recorder himself as rather “awkward and hard.” But this should
be blamed on circumstances. A socialistic convention is not held “to
write novels. Hard realities are colliding, which finds expression in
this hard and awkward resolution.” (This is a euphemistic way of
admitting that something is wrong with the harmonious thoughts of
the international solidarity of workers.) The writer therefore recommends that “this resolution so painfully constructed on the middle of
the road be adopted unanimously.” But the Australian representative
Kröner crisply declared, “The majority of the Australian Labor Party
opposes the immigration of colored workers. As a socialist, I personally
recognize the duty of international solidarity and hope that in time
we shall succeed in winning all nations of the world for the idea of
socialism.”21 Translated from the Australian to English it means: Make
as many resolutions as you please; we shall do as we please. Since the
Labor Party has come to power, Australia, as is well known, has the
strictest immigration laws against colored and white workers.
The nationalistic Anti-Marxists of Germany could perform a great
service by solving the emigration problem. The German mind could
develop a new doctrine of universal freedom and free movement that
would evoke an echo with Italians, Scandinavians, Slavs, Chinese, and
Japanese, and which in the long run no nation could resist. But no
beginning has yet been made of what needs to be done, and surely
nothing has been accomplished.
National Anti-Marxism proved to be unproductive in the very point
on which its greatest emphasis must be placed: the problem of foreign
policy. Its program for the integration of the German nation in the
world economy and world policy does not basically differ from the
precept of German policy in recent decades. In fact, it does not differ
from recent policy more than any theoretical doctrine differs from
the realities faced by the statesman who is kept from his intended
course by his daily tasks. But a violent solution is even less applicable today than it was in prewar Germany. Even a victorious Germany would be powerless to face the real problems of the German
nation. In the present state of world affairs, Germany could never
prevail over the opposing national interests of other nations, that is,
it could not acquire overseas territory for German settlement and
open up favorable markets for German industry. Above all, it could
never be safe from a resumption of the war by a new coalition of
enemies.

86 ANTI - MARXISM

National Anti-Marxism is failing as well in providing suitable German policy for pressing present problems. In their struggle against
forced integration, the German minorities in foreign countries must
demand the most comprehensive democracy because only self-government can protect them from losing their German identity. They
must demand full economic freedom because every intervention in the
hands of the foreign state becomes a means of discrimination against
the German population.22 But how can the German population in the
border territories fight for democracy and economic freedom if the
Reich itself conducts a contrary policy?
National Anti-Marxism has also failed on scientific grounds. The
fact that the Marxian theories of value and distribution have lost
their prestige is not the achievement of Anti-Marxism, but that of
the Austrian School, especially Böhm-Bawerk’s critique which the
young friends of theoretical economics in Germany could no longer
overlook. Surely, the attempts by some writers to confer prestige on
Marx as a philosopher have little prospect for success, because, after
all, philosophical knowledge in Germany has reached a level that
makes scholars somewhat immune to the naivetés of the “philosophy”
of Marx, Dietzgen, Vorländer, and Max Adler. However, in the field of
sociology the categories and thoughts of Marxian materialism continue
to spread. Here, Anti-Marxism could have solved an important task; but
it was content with attacking those final conclusions of Marxism that
appeared to be objectionable politically, without refuting its foundation
and replacing it with a comprehensive doctrine. It had to fail, because
for political reasons it sought to show that Marxism is animated by the
spirit of the West, that it is an offspring of individualism—a concept
alien to German character.
The very starting point is fallacious. We already mentioned that it
is not permissible to contrast the universalistic (collectivistic) with the
individualistic (nominalistic) systems of social doctrine and policy, as
set forth by Dietzel and Pribram, and now advocated by Spann with
his nationalistic German Anti-Marxism. It is also erroneous to view
Marxian socialism as the successor to the liberal democracy of the first
half of the nineteenth century. The connection between the socialism
of Marx and Lassalle and the early democratic program was rather
superficial, and was discarded as serving no further purpose as soon

government intervention serves to make the minorities Czech; in South Tirol and in Poland
the Italians and Poles do not act any differently.

as the Marxian parties came to power. Socialism is no improvement
over liberalism; it is its enemy. It is illogical to deduce a similarity of
the two from an opposition to both.
Marxism does not spring from Western thought. As mentioned
above, it failed to find followers in Western countries because it could
not overcome the utilitarian sociology. The greatest difference between
German ideas and those of the West is the great influence of Marxian
thought in Germany. And German thought will not be able to overcome Marxism until it sheds its hostility toward British, French, and
American sociology. To be sure, it cannot just adopt the sociology of
the West, but it must continue and build anew on its foundation.

SOMBART AS MARXIST AND ANTI - MARXIST

Werner Sombart himself proudly confessed that he gave a good part of
his life to fight for Marx.23 It was Sombart, not the wretched pedants
of the ilk of Kautsky and Bernstein, who introduced Marx to German
science and familiarized German thought with Marxist doctrines. Even
the structure of Sombart’s main work, Modern Capitalism, is Marxian.
The problem Marx raised in Das Kapital and other writings is to be
solved again, this time with the means of advanced knowledge. And
as with Marx, theoretical analysis is to be combined with historical
presentation. The starting point of his work is completely Marxian, but
its findings are purported to go beyond Marx. Thus, he differs from the
publications of party Marxists whose findings are rigidly circumscribed
by party doctrine.
Sombart built his reputation as a Marxist and scholar in 1896 with
his little book Socialism and the Social Movement during the Nineteenth
Century. The booklet saw several editions, and each new edition gave
evidence of the changes in Sombart’s position on the problems of
socialism and the social movement. The tenth edition, revised, is
now available in two imposing volumes.24 It is to demonstrate and
justify his turning away from Marxism—but not from socialism. In
fact, the two volumes do not deal with socialism as such, but rather
with “proletarian socialism,” with “Marxism.”
Sombart deals only with a history and critique of Marxian socialism.
He avoids revealing his own social doctrine, which he briefly touches
23

upon in a few places. With visible satisfaction he speaks of the old
associations of the Middle Ages—church, town, village, clan, family,
vocation—“which contained the individual, warmed him, and protected him like a fruit in its peel.” And with visible horror he speaks of
that “process of disintegration which shattered the world of faith and
replaced it with knowledge.”25 The ideology of proletarian socialism
is seen as an expression of this disintegration process. And between
the lines he is reproaching proletarian socialism for its express preference for modern industrialism. “Whatever socialistic critique may
have raised against capitalism, it never objected on grounds that capitalism has blessed us with railroads and factories, steel furnaces and
machines, telegraph wires and motorcycles, record players and airplanes, movie theatres and power centers, cast iron and aniline colors.”
Proletarianism, according to Sombart, merely rejects the social form,
not the gist of modern civilization. And with clear emphasis on his own
position he confronts proletarian socialism with the “preproletarian
chimera,” with its “bucolic” flavor which always praised agriculture
as the most noble vocation and looked upon agrarian culture as its
ideal.26
This infatuation with agrarian society and the Middle Ages deserves
our comment. We meet it again and again in the literature of nationalistic Anti-Marxism, with variations by individual authors. For Spann,
the leader of this movement, the ideal was a return to the Middle
Ages.27
He who depicts the social institutions and economic organizations
of the Middle Ages as models for the German people, should be aware
that a bucolic Germany could support only a fraction of the present
population even with the greatest curtailment of expectations. Every
proposal that would reduce the productivity of labor diminishes the
supportable population, and, through the deterioration of the apparatus of production, would weaken the national defenses that are so
important from a nationalistic point of view. Nor can nationalism seek
a solution of the German problem in a return to an agrarian society.
The incompatibility of the bucolic ideals with a powerful development of national forces may explain the dark pessimism of the “doom
theories” that are springing up in various forms.
If it should be true that the particular ethos of the German nation
is demanding a return to production methods that lead to lower labor
25

SOMBART AS MARXIST AND ANTI - MARXIST 89

productivity, and that, inversely, the Western nations, the Latin nations
of the South, and Slavic nations in the East think differently and
apply production methods that assure higher labor productivity, the
danger is real that the more numerous and productive enemies will
overpower the German nation. Will the philosophers of the victors
not conclude then that it was lack of adaptability that prevented the
Germans from making use of their capitalistic methods of production?
Will they not look upon the German mentality as being too poor and
unfit for keeping its spiritual equilibrium in the presence of modern
technological achievements?
Indeed, it is a gross materialistic feature of otherwise idealistic
writers who believe that some externalities of life are blocking the
way to inner growth and the development of inner strength. He who
does not know how to safeguard his equilibrium when surrounded
by motorcycles and telephones will not find it in the jungle or desert.
That is, he will not find the strength to overcome the nonessential with
the essential. Man must be able to safeguard himself where-ever he
lives and whatever the circumstances should be. It is a sickly weakness
of nerves that urges one to seek harmonious personality growth in
past ages and remote places.
Sombart, as already mentioned, reveals his social ideal only between the lines. He cannot be criticized for this. But we must fault
him for not offering a precise definition of the concept of socialism in
a book that seeks to present and analyze a certain kind of socialism.
His discussion of socialistic ideology, which introduces the work, is its
weakest part. Sombart rejects the thought that socialism is a social
order based on public property in the means of production. Obviously,
the concept of socialism would have to be a social one, or of the social
sciences, he argues, and could not be from a special field of social life,
such as the economy. The emotions accompanying the controversy
over socialism reveal that the term socialism must comprise yet deeper
problems than “economic technology.”28 But the definition Sombart
then offers must finally return—although with ambiguity—to the
only relevant characteristic of socialism. After lengthy discussions he
arrives at the conclusion that the idea of socialism always comprises
the following components:
1. The ideal of a rational condition of society is to be contrasted
with a historical condition that is irrational: that is, an evaluation
of social conditions as perfect or less perfect. Certain features of
28

See Sombart, Sozialismus und soziale Bewegung, op. cit., vol. I, p. 5 et seq.

90 ANTI - MARXISM

the ideal that are common to all kinds of socialism relate to the
anti-capitalistic essence of socialism: socialism obviously must reject
an economy for profit because of its irrational objectives that spring
from its guiding principle. As money symbolizes the capitalistic
economy for profit, it is as such a favorite target of socialistic
critique. All evil of this world comes from the struggle over the ring
of the Nibelungs; therefore, socialism wants to return the gold to
the Rhine. In the manner socialism opposes the “free” economy it also
opposes its foundation: “free,” i.e., private, property and the “free,”
i.e., labor, contract. It gives rise to exploitation, the worst blemish
of social life, the eradication of which is an essential program for
all kinds of socialism.
2. Valuation of social conditions and adoption of a rational ideal
necessarily correspond to the recognition of moral freedom, the
freedom to strive for a realm of objectives with one’s own strength,
and the faith in the possibility of its realization.
3. Ideal and freedom inevitably give birth to an aspiration for realizing
the ideal, a movement, born in freedom, from the historically given
to the rationally desired. But every confession of socialism means
a renunciation of motive power, that is, from the viewpoint of
the individual it means: obligation, sacrifice, limitation of the
particular.29
There can be only one reason why Sombart chooses this detour,
instead of retaining the proven and only viable definition of socialism:
his aversion toward dealing with the genuine economic problems of
socialism, an aversion that permeates his whole work and constitutes
its greatest deficiency. The fact that Sombart never raises the question
of whether or not a socialistic order is possible and realizable is even
more serious than his renunciation of a clear definition of socialism.
For only this question can provide the foundation for an understanding
of socialism and the socialistic movement.
But Sombart does not want to deal with socialism in general; he
wants to analyze proletarian socialism, or Marxism. However, his definition is unsatisfactory even for proletarian socialism which, according
to Sombart,
is merely an intellectual sediment of the modern social movement
as I have defined it since the first edition of this book. Socialism
29

Emphasis added. Ibid., vol. I, p. 12 et seq.

SOMBART AS MARXIST AND ANTI - MARXIST 91

and social movement are . . . the realization of that future social
order that is adjusted to the interests of the proletariat, or the
attempt at its realization. Socialism seeks its realization in the
world of thought, the socialistic movement in the world of reality.
All theoretical efforts toward revealing the desired goal to the
aspiring proletariat, toward calling it to arms, organizing for battle,
and showing the road on which the goal can be reached, all
comprise what we call modern socialism.30

One thing is noticeable in this definition: it is Marxian. It is no
coincidence that Sombart deems it proper to adopt this definition
unchanged from his first edition, from the time when, by his own
admission, he was still walking in the footsteps of Marx. It contains an
important element from the Marxian world of thought: socialism suits
the interests of the proletariat. This is a specific Marxian thought that is
meaningful only within the framework of the whole Marxian structure.
“Utopian” socialism of the pre-Marxian era and the state socialism in
recent decades acted, not in the interests of one class but on behalf
of all classes and the collective whole. Marxism introduced the two
axioms that society is divided into classes whose interests conflict
irreconcilably, and that the interests of the proletariat—realizable
through class war only—are demanding nationalization of the means
of production, in accordance with their own interests and contrary to
those of the other classes.
This very thought returns in various places in the book. At one
place Sombart observes that very few influential Marxian writers come
from the proletariat “and therefore are only interested parties.”31 And
then point-blank: “The proletariat belongs to the system of capitalism;
the inevitability of hostility toward capitalists springs from the class
conditions of the proletariat. This hostility assumes certain forms in
the social movement: labor unions, socialistic parties, strikes, etc.”32
It cannot be denied that the materialistic philosophy of history is
visible here in full display. To be sure, Sombart does not draw the
conclusion which Marx logically drew in this case: that socialism is
coming with the inevitability of natural law.33 According to Sombart,
the “science of capitalism” founded by Marx introduced “the idea of the
regularity of economic life in our era.” It reveals “that the realization
of any particular socialistic demand depends on very real, objective

conditions and that, therefore, socialism may not always be realizable.”
Marx thus created “scientifically” the thought of resignation which
logically leads from socialism to social reform.34 We need not dwell
further on the question of whether Sombart’s conclusion is the one
that must logically be drawn from the doctrines of Marx, or whether
the opinion of Lenin and Trotsky is the logical one. It is decisive that
Sombart unconsciously continues to stand on the scientific ground of
Marxism. (Sombart drew the reform conclusion in his earlier writings;
this is the “Sombartism” of which the orthodox Marxists speak with
derogatory gestures, as they always do when something displeases
them.)
Wherever Sombart seeks to describe capitalism he does so in the
framework of Marx and Engels, often in their own words.35
Such are the characteristics of Sombart’s position on Marxism:
while he does not embrace the founder’s naively materialistic version
of socialism today, Sombart builds his more refined socialistic doctrines
on the foundation of Marxism. And he draws practical conclusions
other than those of orthodox Marxists. In fact, he does not oppose
socialism in any form.
Sombart reproaches Marx not for his doctrine of class warfare, but
for its politicalization and the final conclusion Marx draws from the
doctrine: the inevitability of the proletarian victory.36 In other words,
Sombart does not say that the Marxian separation of classes does not
exist, or that the properly understood interests of the various layers
of population working in a division of labor do not conflict with each
other, but are harmonious. But he says: Ethics must overcome the conflict of class interests. Besides the class principle “there are other social
principles—namely those of idealistic nature.” But Marxism makes the
class concept absolute.37 Sombart apparently believes that man must
submerge his class interests and give precedence to higher interests,
to national interests. He reproaches the Marxists for not thinking in
terms of fatherland, for conducting world policies, for advocating
class warfare in domestic policies, and for remaining pacifistic and
antinationalistic in foreign policies.
Sombart completely ignores the scientific criticism of the Marxian
class doctrine. This is necessary because he wants to ignore utilitarianism and economic theory and because, in the final analysis, he

37

35

SOMBART AS MARXIST AND ANTI - MARXIST 93

considers Marxism as the true science of capitalism. According to Sombart, “Marx founded . . . the science of capitalism.”38 Long ago this
science “demonstrated conclusively, that this economic order contains
the essence of the destruction and dissolution of civilization. Karl
Marx was the greatest, if not the first, harbinger of this knowledge.”39
In order to escape the conclusions that must be drawn from Marx’s
theories, Sombart knows nothing better than to appeal to God and
eternal values.
Sombart is quite right when he professes that it is not the function
of science to provide a “value critique, that is, to reveal the inferiority
of individual words, analyses, and principles of proletarian socialism.”
But he is mistaken when he declares that scientific critique is “but a
discovery of relationships and their significance, relationships not only
between the various doctrines and corresponding political demands,
but also between the content of the whole system and the basic questions of intellectual civilization and human fate.”40 That is the position
of historicism which is content with pursuing relationships among
scientific theories and between scientific theories and metaphysical
systems of thought, but abstains from developing scientific theories of
its own. A sociological theory, which Marxism represents in spite of its
shortcomings, can be analyzed only by examining its usefulness for an
explanation of social phenomena. And it can be replaced only with a
theory that is more satisfactory.41
It could not be otherwise. Sombart’s critique of proletarian socialism rests on a subjective value judgment of what he considers the
“basic values” of the proletariat. Here, world view meets world view,
metaphysics confronts metaphysics. It is confession, not perception,
and has no bearing on science. Of course, there are many readers
who appreciate Sombart’s work for this very reason. It does not limit
itself to the narrow field of scientific labor, but offers metaphysical
syntheses. It is not mere scientific research, but the presentation of
material permeated with the spirit and personality of the man and
thinker, Sombart. This is what gives the book its character and significance. In the end it convinces only those readers who already share
Sombart’s view.

Sombart does not attempt a critique of the means by which socialism proposes to attain its ends. And yet, any scientific analysis of
socialism must first examine the thesis of the higher productivity of
socialistic production, and then question whether or not a socialistic
mode of production is possible at all. Nor does Sombart’s criticism
more than touch upon the problem of the inevitability of socialism.
Sombart’s book is a special literary phenomenon. It frequently
happens that in a scholar’s lifetime he changes his opinion and in a
new book advocates what he opposed earlier. But it was always a new
book that revealed the intellectual change, as, for instance, Plato’s
Laws which followed his Republic. It is very rare, however, that an
author reveals his lifelong struggle with one problem in ever new
revisions of the same work, as does Sombart. Therefore, we must
not conclude that the present edition contains the last version of his
statement on socialism. Many years of labor lie ahead, new editions
of Socialism will be needed not only because previous editions are
out of print, but because Sombart has not yet completed his work
on the problems of socialism. The book in its present form merely
represents a stage in Sombart’s struggle with Marxism. He has not yet
freed himself as much as he thinks he has. A great deal of intellectual
work remains to be done.
Sombart’s inner struggle with the problems of Marxism is symptomatic of the thinking of many German scholars. Each edition of the
book reflects rather well what the intellectual leaders of Germany have
been thinking of this problem. The changes in his opinion mirror the
changes in the opinion of German intellectuals who have followed his
leadership for a generation.

ANTI - MARXISM AND SCIENCE

Anti-Marxism fully subscribes to Marxism’s hostility towards capitalism.
And it resents Marxism’s political program, especially its presumed
internationalism and pacifism. But resentment does not lend itself
to scientific work, or even to politics. At best it lends itself to demagoguery.
But for every scientific thinker the objectionable point of Marxism
is its theory, which seems to cause no offense to the Anti-Marxist. We
have seen how Sombart continues to appreciate Marx as a man of
science. The Anti-Marxist merely objects to the political symptoms
of the Marxian system, not to its scientific content. He regrets the
harm done by Marxian policies to the German people, but is blind

ANTI - MARXISM AND SCIENCE 95

to the harm done to German intellectual life by the platitudes and
deficiencies of Marxian problems and solutions. Above all, he fails to
perceive that political and economic troubles are consequences of this
intellectual calamity. He does not appreciate the importance of science
for everyday living, and, under the influence of Marxism, believes that
“real” power instead of ideas is shaping history.
We can completely agree with Anti-Marxism that the recovery of
Germany must begin with overcoming Marxism. But this overcoming,
if it is to be permanent, must be the work of science, not of a political
movement that is guided by resentment. German science must free
itself of the bonds of Marxism by putting behind it the historicism
which for decades has kept it intellectually impotent. It must shed its
fear of theory in economics and sociology and get acquainted with the
theoretical achievements (even those by Germany) attained during
the last generation.
Carl Menger’s statements of more than forty years ago on modern
German economic literature are still valid today and apply to all the
social sciences: “Scarcely noticed abroad, and barely understandable
abroad on account of its peculiar tendencies, German economics for
decades has remained untouched by serious opponents. With unflinching confidence in its own methods it often has lacked serious selfcriticism. He who pursued another direction in Germany was ignored,
not refuted.”42 Only a thorough study of the works of German and
foreign sociology differing from etatism and historicism could help to
extricate it from the deadlock of prevailing doctrine in Germany. German science would not be the only beneficiary. Great problems await
their solution that cannot be achieved without German cooperation.
Again in the words of Menger: “All great civilized nations have their
particular mission in the unfolding of science. Each aberration of a
sizeable number of scholars of one nation leaves a gap in the development of scientific knowledge. Economics, too, cannot do without the
singleminded cooperation of the German mind.”43
Above all, German science must make a proper assessment of
the importance of Marxism. It is true, the Marxists and Anti-Marxists
greatly overestimate Marxism as a scientific system. But also those
who deny Marx as the first harbinger of the substance of the Marxian
doctrine raise no objection against the validity of the doctrine itself.
Only he who can see the world without Marxian blinders may approach
the great problems of sociology. Only when German science has freed
42

itself from the Marxian errors in which it is enmeshed today, then, and
only then, will the power of Marxist slogans disappear from political
life.

THEORY OF PRICE CONTROLS
1

1

INTRODUCTION

The knowledge that the constellation of the market determines prices
precisely, or at least within narrow limits, is relatively new. Some
earlier writers may have had a dim notion of it, but only the Physiocrats and the classical economists elaborated a system of exchange
and market relations. The science of catallactics thus replaced the
indeterminism of theory, which explained prices from the demands of
sellers, and saw no price limits other than their fairness.
He who believes the formation of prices to be arbitrary easily
arrives at the demand that they should be fixed by external regulation.
If the conscience of the seller is lacking, if without fear of the wrath
of God he demands more than is “fair,” a worldly authority must
intervene in order to help justice prevail. And minimum prices must
be imposed for certain commodities and services over which buyers
are believed, not quite logically, to have the power to force deviations
from the just price. Government is called upon to create order because
disorder and arbitrariness prevail.
The practical doctrine based on the knowledge of scientific economics and sociology—liberalism—rejects all intervention as superfluous, useless, and harmful. It is superfluous because built-in forces
are at work that limit the arbitrariness of the exchanging parties. It is
useless because the government objective of lower prices cannot be
achieved by controls. And it is harmful because it deters production
and consumption from those uses that, from the consumer’s viewpoint, are most important. At times liberalism has called government
intervention impossible. Of course, government can issue orders that
regulate prices and punish the violators. Therefore, it would have been
more appropriate for liberalism not to call price controls impossible,
but rather unsuitable, that is, running counter to the intentions of their
advocates. The following discussion will demonstrate this unsuitability.
Liberalism was soon replaced by socialism, which seeks to replace
private property in the means of production with public property.
Socialism as such need not reject the price knowledge of science; it is
1

vol. VI, 1923.

97

98 THEORY OF PRICE CONTROLS

conceivable that it could recognize its usefulness for an understanding
of market phenomena in its own economic order. If it were to do that,
it would have to conclude that government and other interference
with prices is as superfluous, useless, and harmful as liberalism says it
is. In fact, the doctrines of Marxism contain, besides quite incompatible principles and demands, the beginnings of this perception; this is
clearly visible in the skepticism toward the belief that wage rates can
be raised by labor-union tactics, and in the rejection of all methods
Marx calls “bourgeois.” But in the world of Marxian reality etatism
is dominant. In theory etatism is the doctrine of state omnipotence,
and in practice, it is the government policy to manage all worldly
matters through orders and prohibitions. The social ideal of etatism
is a special kind of socialism, such as state socialism or, under certain
conditions, military or religious socialism. On the surface the social
ideal of etatism does not differ from the social order of capitalism.
Etatism does not seek to overthrow the traditional legal order and
formally convert all private property in production to public property.
Only the largest enterprises in industry, mining, and transportation are
to be nationalized. In agriculture, and in medium- and small-scale production, private property is to be preserved formally. But in substance
all enterprises are to become government operations. Under this practice, the owners will keep their names and trademarks on the property
and the right to an “appropriate” income or one “befitting their ranks.”
Every business becomes an office and every occupation a civil service.
There is no room for entrepreneurial independence in any of the varieties of state socialism. Prices are set by government, and government
determines what is to be produced, how it is to be produced, and in
what quantities. There is no speculation, no “extraordinary” profits, no
losses. There is no innovation, except for that ordered by government.
Government guides and supervises everything.
It is one of the peculiarities of etatist doctrine that it can envision
man’s social life only in terms of its special socialistic ideal. The outer
similarity between the “social state” it extols and the social order based
on private property in production causes it to overlook the essential difference that separates them. To the etatist, any dissimilarity of the two
social orders is merely a temporary irregularity and a punishable violation of government orders. The state has slackened the reins, which it
must pull short again, and everything will be in the best of order. The
fact that man’s social life is subject to certain conditions, to regularity
like that of nature, is a concept that is alien to an etatist. To him,
everything is power, which he views in a grossly materialistic light.

PRICE CONTROLS 99

Although etatism did not succeed in supplanting the other socialistic ideals with its own ideal, it has defeated all other branches of
socialism in practical policy. In spite of their diverging opinions and
objectives all socialistic groups today seek to influence market prices
through outside intervention and force.
The theory of price controls must investigate the effects of government interference with market prices in the private property order.
It is not its task to analyze price controls in a socialistic order that
preserves private property by form and outward appearance, and uses
price controls to direct production and consumption. In this case the
controls have only technical significance, and remain without influence on the nature of the issue. And they alone do not constitute the
difference between the socialistic society that uses them and those
socialistic societies that are organized along different lines.
The importance of the theory of price controls becomes evident
in the contention that there is yet a third social order besides the
private property order and one built on public property, an order that
retains private property in the means of production, but is “regulated”
through government intervention. The Socialists of the Chair and
the Solidarists, together with a great many statesmen and powerful
political parties, continue to hold to this belief. On the one hand, it
plays a role in the interpretation of economic history during the Middle
Ages, and on the other hand, it constitutes the theoretic foundation
for modern interventionism.

PRICE CONTROLS

Sanctioning Controls. We may call those controls “sanctioning” that set
prices so close to those the unhampered market would set that only
insignificant consequences can ensue. Such controls merely pursue
a limited task and do not achieve great economic objectives through
interference with market forces. Government may simply accept the
market prices and sanction them with its intervention. The case is
similar when government imposes price ceilings that lie above the
market prices, and minimum prices that lie below them. The case
is slightly different when government imposes controls in order to
force a monopolist to charge competitive prices instead of higher
monopolistic prices. If government creates monopolies or limits the
number of competitors, thereby promoting monopolistic agreements,
it must, without question, resort to price controls if it does not want
to force consumers to pay monopolistic prices. In none of these cases

100 THEORY OF PRICE CONTROLS

is the result of government intervention a deviation of price from that
of the unhampered market.
The situation is somewhat different when a government regulation deprives a seller of the opportunity, under certain conditions, to
demand and obtain a price that is higher than that he can normally
obtain. If, for instance, government fixed rates for taxicabs, cabbies
would be prevented from exploiting those cases in which passengers
are willing to pay more than normal rates. The affluent tourist who,
late at night and in bad weather, arrives at a strange railroad station,
accompanied by small children and loaded with many pieces of luggage, will gladly pay a much higher fare to get to a remote hotel if he
must compete with others for the few or perhaps only taxicab offering
a ride. With extraordinary gains from exceptional opportunities, the
cabbies would be able, when business is poor, to charge lower rates
in order to increase the demand for their services. Government intervention thus eliminates the difference between the fare at times of
great demand and those of weak demand, and establishes an average
rate. Now, if government fixes rates that are even lower than this ideal
average price, we have genuine price control, to which I shall return
shortly.
The case is similar where government does not set prices directly,
but forces the seller, such as a restaurateur, to post his prices. This, too,
has the effect that the seller is prevented from exploiting extraordinary
situations in which he could obtain a higher price from individual
buyers. He must take account of this limitation; if he is prevented from
charging more under favorable conditions, he will find it difficult to
charge less under unfavorable conditions.
Other price controls are to prevent windfall profits that might be
reaped under extraordinary conditions. If a city power company for
any reason should be prevented from generating power for a few days,
candle prices would soar, and merchants with candle supplies would
reap extraordinary profits. Now government intervenes and sets a
price ceiling for candles, at the same time forcing the sale of candles
as long as the supply lasts. This has no permanent effect on the candle
supply inasmuch as the power failure is quickly corrected. Only insofar
as merchants and producers, having such failures in mind, calculate
prices and candle inventory does government intervention have future
consequences. If the merchants must anticipate that under similar
conditions government will again intervene, the price charged under
normal conditions will rise and the incentive for larger inventories will
be reduced.

PRICE CONTROLS 101

Genuine Controls. We may call those price controls “genuine” that
set prices differing from those the unhampered market would set. If
government seeks to fix a price higher than the market price, it usually
resorts to minimum prices. If government seeks to fix a price lower
than the market price it usually imposes price ceilings.
Let us first consider the ceiling, or maximum, price. The natural
price that would emerge in an unhampered market corresponds to an
equilibrium of all prices. At that point price and cost coincide. Now,
if a government order necessitates a readjustment, if the sellers are
forced to sell their goods at lower prices, the proceeds fall below costs.
Therefore, the sellers will abstain from selling—except for merchandise
that quickly spoils or otherwise loses in value—and hold on to their
goods in the hope that the government regulation will soon be lifted.
But the potential buyers will be unable to buy the desired goods. If
possible, they now may buy some substitute they would not have
otherwise bought. (It should also be noted that the prices of these
substitute goods must rise on account of the greater demand.) But it
was never the intention of government to bring about these effects. It
wanted the buyers to enjoy the goods at lower prices, not to deprive
them of the opportunity to buy the goods at all. Therefore, government
tends to supplement the price ceiling with an order to sell all goods
at this price as long as the supply lasts. At this point price controls
encounter their greatest difficulty. The market interaction brings about
a price at which demand and supply tend to coincide. The number of
potential buyers willing to pay the market price is large enough for the
whole market supply to be sold. If government lowers the price below
that which the unhampered market would set, the same quantity of
goods faces a greater number of potential buyers who are willing to
pay the lower official price. Supply and demand no longer coincide;
demand exceeds supply, and the market mechanism, which tends to
bring supply and demand together through changes in price, no longer
functions.
Mere coincidence now eliminates as many buyers as the given
supply cannot accommodate. Perhaps those buyers who come first
or have personal connections with the sellers will get the goods. The
recent war with its many attempts at price controls provided examples
of both. At the official price, goods could be bought either by a friend
of the seller or by an early bird in the “polonaise.” But government
cannot be content with this selection of buyers. It wants everyone to
have the goods at lower prices, and would like to avoid situations in
which people cannot get any goods for their money. Therefore, it must

102 THEORY OF PRICE CONTROLS

go beyond the order to sell; it must resort to rationing. The quantity of
merchandise coming to the market is no longer left to the discretion of
sellers and buyers. Government now distributes the available supply
and gives everyone at the official price what he is entitled to under
the ration regulation.
But government cannot even stop here. The intervention mentioned so far concerns only the available supply. When that is exhausted
the empty inventories will not be replenished because production no
longer covers its costs. If government wants to secure a supply for
consumers it must pronounce an obligation to produce. If necessary, it
must fix the prices of raw materials and semimanufactured products,
and eventually also wage rates, and force businessmen and workers
to produce and labor at these prices.
It can thus be readily seen that it is inconceivable to resort to price
controls as an isolated intervention in the private property order. Government is unable to achieve the desired result, and therefore finds
it necessary to proceed step by step from the isolated pricing order
to comprehensive control over labor, the means of production, what
is produced, how it is produced, and how it is distributed. Isolated
intervention in the market operation merely disrupts the service to
consumers, and forces them to seek substitutes for those items they
deem most important; it thus fails to achieve the very result government meant to achieve. The history of war socialism has clearly
illustrated this. Governments seeking to interfere with market operations found it necessary, step by step, to proceed from the original
isolated price interference to complete socialization of production.
Government would have had to proceed ever faster if its price regulations had been observed more faithfully, and if black markets had
not circumvented the regulations. The fact that government did not
take the final step, the nationalization of the whole apparatus of
production, was due to the early end of the war, which brought an
end to the war economy. He who observes a war economy is clearly
aware of the phases mentioned above: at first price control, then
forced sales, then rationing, then regulation of production and distribution, and, finally, attempts at central planning of all production and
distribution.
Price controls have played an especially important role in the
history of coin debasement and inflationary policy. Again and again,
governments have tried to enforce old prices in spite of coin debasement and expansion of circulating money. They did so again in the
most recent and greatest of all inflation periods, during the World

PRICE CONTROLS 103

War. On the very day printing presses were put into the service of
government finance, rising prices were fought with criminal law. Let
us assume that this at first succeeded. And let us disregard the fact
that the supply of goods was reduced by the war, which affected the
exchange ratio between economic goods and money. Let us further
ignore increased demand for money due to delayed money delivery
or clearing system limitations and other restrictions. We merely wish
to analyze the consequences of a policy that aims at stabilizing prices
while the quantity of money is enlarged. The expansion of money creates new demand that did not exist before, “new purchasing power,”
as it is called. When the new buyers compete with those already in the
market, and prices are not permitted to rise, only a part of demand
can be satisfied. There are potential buyers who are willing to pay the
price, but cannot find a supply. Government, which is circulating the
newly created money, is seeking thereby to redirect commodities and
services from previous uses to more desirable uses. It wants to buy
them, not to commandeer them, which it certainly could do. Its intent
is that money, only money, shall buy everything, and that potential
buyers shall not be frustrated in their search for economic goods. After
all, government itself wants to buy, it wants to use the market, not
destroy it.
The official price is destroying the market on which commodities and services are exchanged for money. Wherever possible, the
exchange continues in other ways. For instance, people resort to barter
transactions, that is, to exchange without the interaction of money.
Government, which is ill-prepared for such transactions because it
owns no exchangeable goods, cannot approve of such a development.
It is coming to the market with money only, and therefore is hoping that the purchasing power of the monetary unit is not further
reduced by the money holders’ inability to get the goods they want
with their money. As a buyer of commodities and services itself, government cannot adhere to the principle that the old prices must not be
exceeded. In short, government as issuer of new money cannot escape
the consequences described by the quantity theory.
If government imposes a price higher than that determined by the
unhampered market, and prohibits the sale at lower prices (minimum
prices), demand must decline. At the lower market price supply and
demand coincide. At the official higher price demand tends to trail
supply, and some goods brought to the market cannot find a buyer. As
government imposed the minimum price in order to assure the sellers
profitable sales, the result was unintended by government. Therefore,

104 THEORY OF PRICE CONTROLS

it must resort to other means, which again, step by step, must lead to
complete government control over the means of production.
Especially significant are those minimum prices that set wage
rates (minimum wages). Such rates may be set either directly by
government or indirectly by promoting labor union policies that aim
at establishing minimum wages. When, through strikes or threats
of strikes, labor unions enforce a wage rate that is higher than that
determined by the unhampered market, they can do so only with the
assistance of government. The strike is made effective by denying
the protection of the law and administration to workers willing to
work. In fact, it is irrelevant for our analysis whether the apparatus
of coercion imposing the controls is the “legitimate” state apparatus
or a sanctioned apparatus with public power. If a minimum wage
that exceeds the unhampered market rate is imposed on a particular industry, its costs of production are raised, the price of the final
product must rise, and correspondingly, sales must decline. Workers lose their jobs, which depresses wages in other industries. Up to
this point we may agree with the wage fund theory on the effects
of nonmarket wage boosts. That which the workers in one industry
are gaining is lost by the workers in other industries. In order to
avoid such consequences, the imposition of minimum wages must be
accompanied by the prohibition to dismiss workers. The prohibition in
turn reduces the industry’s rate of return because unneeded workers
must be paid, or they are used and paid in full production while their
output is sold at a loss. Industrial activity then tends to decline. If this,
too, is to be prevented, government must intervene again with new
regulations.
If the minimum wage is not limited to a few industries, but is
imposed on all industries of an isolated economy, or on the world
economy, the rise in product prices caused by it cannot lead to a reduction in consumption.2 The higher wages raise the workers’ spending
power. They can now buy the higher-priced products coming to the
market. (To be sure, there may be shifting within the industries.) If
entrepreneurs and capitalists do not want to consume their capital
they must limit their consumption since their money income has not
risen and they are unable to pay the higher prices. To the extent of
this reduction in consumption, the general wage boost has given the
workers a share of entrepreneurial profits and capital income. The
workers’ real raise is visible in that prices do not rise by the full amount
2

We are ignoring the monetary forces’ exerting their influence on prices.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE THEORY OF PRICE CONTROL 105

of the wage boost because of the entrepreneurs’ and capitalists’ cutback in consumption. That is, the rise in consumer prices is less than
that of wages. But it is well known that even if all property income
were divided among the workers, their individual incomes would rise
very little, which should dispel any illusion about such a reduction in
property income. But if we were to assume that the wage boost and
rise in prices should allocate a large part, if not all, of the real income
of entrepreneurs and capitalists to workers, we must bear in mind that
the former want to live and will therefore consume their capital for
lack of entrepreneurial income. Elimination of capital income through
coercive wage boosts thus merely leads to capital consumption, and
thereby to continuous reduction in national income. (By the way, every
attempt at abolishing capital income must have the same consequence
unless it is achieved through all-round nationalization of production
and consumption.) If again government seeks to avoid these undesirable effects, no alternative is left, from the etatist point of view, but to
seize control over the means of production from the owners.
Our discussion applies only to those price controls that endeavor to
set prices differing from those of the unhampered market. If the controls should seek to undercut monopolistic prices, the consequences
are quite different. Government then may effectively intervene anywhere in the range between the higher monopolistic price and the
lower competitive price. Under certain conditions price controls may
deprive a monopolist of specific monopolistic gains. Let us assume, for
instance, that in an isolated economy a sugar cartel is holding sugar
prices above those the unhampered market would set. Government
could then impose a minimum price for sugar beets that is higher than
the unhampered market price. But the effects of price controls could
not develop as long as the intervention merely absorbs the specific
monopoly gain of the sugar monopolist. Only when the beet price is
set so high that sugar production becomes unprofitable even at the
monopolistic price, forcing the sugar monopoly to raise prices and
curtail production in line with shrinking demand, will the price control
effects take place.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE THEORY OF PRICE CONTROL
FOR THE THEORY OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION

The most important theoretical knowledge gained from a basic analysis
of the effects of price controls is this: the effect of intervention is
the very opposite of what it was meant to achieve. If government

106 THEORY OF PRICE CONTROLS

is to avoid the undesirable consequences it cannot stop with just
market interference. Step by step it must continue until it finally
seizes control over production from the entrepreneurs and capitalists.
It is unimportant, then, how it regulates the distribution of income,
whether or not it grants a preferred income position to entrepreneurs
and capitalists. It is important, however, that government cannot be
satisfied with a single intervention, but is driven on to nationalize the
means of production. This ultimate effect refutes the notion that there
is a middle form of organization, the “regulated” economy, between the
private property order and the public property order. In the former only
the play of market forces can determine prices. If government prevents
this play in any way, production loses its meaning and becomes chaotic.
Finally, government must assume control in order to avoid the chaos
it created.
Thus, we must agree with the classical liberals and some older
socialists who believed it impossible in the private property order to
eliminate the market influence on prices, and thereby on production
and distribution, by decreeing prices that differ from market prices.
For them it was no empty doctrinarism, but a profound recognition of
social principles, when they emphasized the alternative: private property or public property, capitalism or socialism. Indeed, for a society
based on division of labor there are only these two possibilities; middle forms of organization are conceivable only in the sense that some
means of production may be publicly owned while others are owned
privately. But wherever property is in private hands, government intervention cannot eliminate the market price without simultaneously
abolishing the regulating principle of production.

THE NATIONALIZATION OF CREDIT ?*
Arthur Travers-Borgstroem, a Finnish writer, published a book entitled
Mutualism that deals with ideas of social reform, and culminates in a
plea for the nationalization of credit. A German edition appeared in
1923. In 1917, the author had established a foundation under his name
in Berne, Switzerland, whose primary objective was the conferring of
prizes for writings on the nationalization of credit. The panel of judges
consisted of Professors Diehl, Weyermann, Milhaud, and Reichesberg,
the bankers Milliet, Somary, Kurz, and others. The judges awarded
a prize to a paper submitted by Dr. Robert Deumer, director of the
Reichsbank in Berlin. This paper was published in book form by the
Mutualist Association of Finland.1
From the background material of the paper we can learn why the
author is not concerned with the rationale of credit nationalization,
but merely with the details of its realization. Dr. Deumer is presenting a
proposal, elaborated in its insignificant details, on the nationalization
of all German institutions of banking and credit, and the establishment
of a national credit monopoly. But his plan can be of no interest to us as
no one is contemplating its implementation in the foreseeable future.
And if there ever should be such a movement, conditions may be quite
different so that the Deumer proposal will not be applicable. Therefore,
it would not make any sense to discuss its details, such as article I,
section 10, of the “Draft of a Bill Nationalizing Banking and Credit,”
which reads: “He who engages in any banking and credit transaction
after the nationalization will be subject to a fine not exceeding ten
million gold marks, or imprisonment up to five years, or both.”2
Deumer’s work is of interest to us because of its motives for the
nationalization of credit, and its statements on a reform that preserves
the superiority of “profit” management over “bureaucratic” management. These statements reveal an opinion that is shared by a large
* Translator’s note: In his Notes and Recollections (South Holland, Ill.: Libertarian Press,
1977) the author revealed that he meant to include this essay—written in 1926—in the
original German edition (1929). It was left out of that volume through editorial error, but
was included in the 1976 German edition.

107

108 THE NATIONALIZATION OF CREDIT ?

majority of our contemporaries, yes, that is even accepted without
contradiction. If we should share this Deumer-Travers-Borgstroemmutualist position we must welcome a nationalization of credit and
every other measure leading to socialism. In fact, we must agree to its
realizability and even its urgent necessity.
The public welcomes all proposals designed to limit the sphere of
private property and entrepreneurship because it readily accepts the
critique of the private property order by the Socialists of the Chair
in Germany, the Solidarists in France, the Fabians in Great Britain,
and the Institutionalists in the United States. If the nationalization
proposals have not yet been fully realized we must not search for
any opposition in social literature and the political parties. We must
look to the fact that the public realizes that whenever enterprises are
nationalized and municipalized or government otherwise interferes
with economic life, financial failure and serious disruption of production and transportation follow instead of the desired consequences.
Ideology has not yet taken stock of this failure of reality. It continues
to hold fast to the desirability of public enterprises and the inferiority
of private enterprises. And it continues to find only malice, selfishness,
and ignorance in opposition to its proposals, of which every objective
observer should approve.
Under such conditions an analysis of Deumer’s reasoning seems to
be in order.
1

PRIVATE INTEREST AND PUBLIC INTEREST

According to Deumer, banks presently serve private interests. They
serve public interests only inasmuch as these do not conflict with
the former. Banks do not finance those enterprises that are most
essential from the national point of view, but only those that promise
to yield the highest return. For instance, they finance “a whiskey
distillery or any other enterprise that is superfluous for the economy.”
“From the national point of view, their activity is not only useless, but
even harmful.” “Banks permit enterprises to grow whose products
are not in demand; they stimulate unnecessary consumption, which
in turn reduces the people’s purchasing power for goods that are
more important culturally and rationally. Furthermore, their loans
waste socially necessary capital, which causes essential production to
decline, or at least their costs of credit, and thus their production costs,
to rise.”3
3

Ibid., p. 86.

PRIVATE INTEREST AND PUBLIC INTEREST 109

Obviously, Deumer does not realize that in a market order capital
and labor are distributed over the economy in such a way that, except
for the risk premium, capital yields the same return, and similar labor
earns the same wage everywhere. The production of “unnecessary”
goods pays no more and no less than that of “essential goods.” In
the final analysis, it is the consumers in the market who determine
the employment of capital and labor in the various industries. When
the demand for an item rises its prices will rise and thus the profits,
which causes new enterprises to be built and existing enterprises to be
expanded. Consumers decide whether this or that industry will receive
more capital. If they demand more beer, more beer will be brewed. If
they want more classical plays, the theatres will add classics to their
repertoire and offer fewer antics, slapstick, and operettas. The taste of
the public, not the producer, decides that The Merry Widow and The
Garden of Eden are performed more often than Goethe’s Tasso.
To be sure, Deumer’s taste differs from that of the public. He is
convinced that people should spend their money differently. Many
would agree with him. But from this difference in taste Deumer draws
the conclusion that a socialistic command system should be established
through nationalization of credit, so that public consumption can be
redirected. On this we must disagree with Deumer.
Guided by central authority according to central plan, a socialistic
economy can be democratic or dictatorial. A democracy in which
the central authority depends on public support through ballots and
elections cannot proceed differently from the capitalistic economy.
It will produce and distribute what the public likes, that is, alcohol,
tobacco, trash in literature, on the stage, and in the cinema, and
fashionable frills. The capitalistic economy, however, caters as well to
the taste of a few consumers. Goods are produced that are demanded
by some consumers, and not by all. The democratic command economy
with its dependence on popular majority need not consider the special
wishes of the minority. It will cater exclusively to the masses. But
even if it is managed by a dictator who, without consideration for
the wishes of the public, enforces what he deems best, who clothes,
feeds, and houses the people as he sees fit, there is no assurance that
he will do what appears proper to “us.” The critics of the capitalistic
order always seem to believe that the socialistic system of their dreams
will do precisely what they think correct. While they may not always
count on becoming dictators themselves, they are hoping that the
dictator will not act without first seeking their advice. Thus they arrive
at the popular contrast of productivity and profitability. They call

110 THE NATIONALIZATION OF CREDIT ?

“productive” those economic actions they deem correct. And because
things may be different at times they reject the capitalistic order which
is guided by profitability and the wishes of consumers, the true masters
of markets and production. They forget that a dictator, too, may act
differently from their wishes, and that there is no assurance that he
will really try for the “best,” and, even if he should seek it, that he
should find the way to the “best.”
It is an even more serious question whether a dictatorship of
the “best” or a committee of the “best” can prevail over the will of
the majority. Will the people, in the long run, tolerate an economic
dictatorship that refuses to give them what they want to consume and
gives them only what the leaders deem useful? Will not the masses
succeed in the end in forcing the leaders to pay heed to public wishes
and taste and do what the reformers sought to prevent?
We may agree with Deumer’s subjective judgment that the consumption by our fellow men is often undesirable. If we believe this we
may attempt to convince them of their errors. We may inform them
of the harm of excessive use of alcohol and tobacco, of the lack of
value of certain movies, and of many other things. He who wants to
promote good writings may imitate the example of the Bible Society that makes financial sacrifices in order to sell Bibles at reduced
prices and to make them available in hotels and other public places.
If this is yet insufficient, there cannot be any doubt that the will of
our fellow men must be subdued. Economic production according to
profitability means production according to the wishes of consumers,
whose demand determines goods prices and thus capital yield and
entrepreneurial profit. Whenever economic production according to
“national productivity” deviates from the former, it means production
that disregards the consumers’ wishes, but pleases the dictator or
committee of dictators.
Surely, in a capitalistic order a fraction of national income is spent
by the rich on luxuries. But regardless of the fact that this fraction is
very small and does not substantially affect production, the luxury of
the well-to-do has dynamic effects that seem to make it one of the
most important forces of economic progress. Every innovation makes
its appearance as a “luxury” of the few well-to-do. After industry has
become aware of it, the luxury then becomes a “necessity” for all.
Take, for example, our clothing, the lighting and bathroom facilities,
the automobile, and travel facilities. Economic history demonstrates
how the luxury of yesterday has become today’s necessity. A great
deal of what people in the less capitalistic countries consider luxury

BUREAUCRATIC MANAGEMENT OR PROFIT MANAGEMENT OF BANKING ? 111

is a common good in the more capitalistically developed countries.
In Vienna, ownership of a car is a luxury (not just in the eyes of the
tax collector); in the United States, one out of four or five individuals
owns one.
The critic of the capitalist order who seeks to improve the conditions of the masses should not point at this luxury consumption
as long as he has not disproved the assertion of theorists and the
experience of reality that only capitalistic production assures highest
possible production. If a command system produces less than a private
property order it will obviously not be possible to supply the masses
with more than they have today.
2

BUREAUCRATIC MANAGEMENT OR PROFIT MANAGEMENT
OF BANKING ?

The poor performance of public enterprises is usually blamed on
bureaucratic management. In order to render state, municipal, and
other public operations as successful as private enterprise they should
be organized and directed along commercial lines. This is why for
decades everything has been tried to make such operations more
productive through “commercialization.” The problem became all the
more important as state and municipal operations expanded. But not
by a single step has anyone come closer to the solution.
Deumer, too, deems it necessary “to manage the national banking
monopoly along commercial lines,” and makes several recommendations on how to achieve this.4 They do not differ from many other
proposals in recent years or from those which under the circumstances
could and have been achieved. We hear of schools and examinations, of promotion of the “able,” of sufficient pay for employees, and
of profit-sharing for leading officials. But Deumer does not see the
essence of the problem any more clearly than do any others who seek
to make the inevitably unproductive system of public operations more
productive.
Deumer, in step with prevailing opinion, seems to believe erroneously that the “commercial” is a form of organization that can
easily be grafted onto government enterprises in order to debureaucratize them. That which usually is called “commercial” is the essence
of private enterprise aiming at nothing but the greatest possible
profitability. And that which usually is called “bureaucratic” is the
4

Ibid., p. 210.

112 THE NATIONALIZATION OF CREDIT ?

essence of government operations aiming at “national” objectives.
A government enterprise can never be “commercialized” no matter
how many external features of private enterprise are superimposed
on it.
The entrepreneur operates on his own responsibility. If he does not
produce at lowest costs of capital and labor what consumers believe
they need most urgently, he suffers losses. But losses finally lead to
a transfer of his wealth, and thus his power of control over means
of production, to more capable hands. In a capitalistic economy the
means of production are always on the way to the most capable manager, that is, to one who is able to use these means most economically
to the satisfaction of consumer needs. A public enterprise, however, is
managed by men who do not face the consequences of their success
or failure.
The same is said to be true of the leading executives of large private
enterprises which therefore are run as “bureaucratically” as state and
municipal operations. But such arguments ignore the basic difference
between public and private enterprises.
In a private, profit-seeking enterprise, every department and division is controlled by bookkeeping and accounting aiming at the
same profit objective. Departments and divisions that are unprofitable
are reorganized or closed. Workers and executives who fail in their
assigned tasks are removed. Accounting in dollars and cents controls
every part of the business. Monetary calculation alone shows the way
to highest profitability. The owners, that is, the stockholders of a corporation, issue only one order to the manager who transmits it to the
employees: earn profits.
The situation is quite different in the bureaus and courts that
administer the affairs of the state. Their tasks cannot be measured and
calculated in a way market prices are calculated, and the order given to
subordinates cannot be so easily defined as that of an entrepreneur to
his employees. If the administration is to be uniform and all executive
power is not to be delegated to the lowest officials, their actions
must be regulated in every detail for every conceivable case. Thus it
becomes the duty of every official to follow these instructions. Success
and failure are of lesser importance than formal observance of the
regulation. This is especially visible in the hiring, treatment, and
promotion of personnel, and is called “bureaucratism.” It is no evil
that springs from some failure or shortcoming of the organization or
the incompetency of officials. It is the nature of every enterprise that
is not organized for profit.

BUREAUCRATIC MANAGEMENT OR PROFIT MANAGEMENT OF BANKING ? 113

When state and municipality go beyond the sphere of court and
police, bureaucratism becomes a basic problem of social organization.
Even a profit-seeking public enterprise could not be unbureaucratic.
Attempts have been made to eliminate bureaucratism through profitsharing by managers. But since they could not be expected to bear the
eventual losses, they are tempted to become reckless, which then is
to be avoided by limiting the manager’s authority through directives
from higher officials, boards, committees, and “expert” opinions. Thus
again, more regulation and bureaucratization are created.
But usually public enterprises are expected to strive for more than
profitability. This is why they are owned and operated by government.
Deumer, too, demands of the nationalized banking system that it be
guided by national rather than private considerations, that it should
invest its funds not where the return is highest, but where they serve
the national interest.5
We need not analyze other consequences of such credit policies,
such as the preservation of uneconomical enterprises. But let us look
at their effects on the management of public enterprises. When the
national credit service or one of its branches submits an unfavorable
income statement it may plead: “To be sure, from the viewpoint of
private interest and profitability we were not very successful. But it
must be borne in mind that the loss shown by commercial accounting
is offset by public services that are not visible in the accounts. For
instance, dollars and cents cannot express our achievements in the
preservation of small and medium enterprises, in the improvements of
the material conditions of the ‘backbone’ classes of population.” Under
such conditions the profitability of an enterprise loses significance. If
public management is to be audited at all, it must be judged with the
yardstick of bureaucratism. Management must be regimented, and
positions must be filled with individuals who are willing to obey the
regulations.
No matter how we may search, it is impossible to find a form
of organization that could prevent the strictures of bureaucratism in
public enterprises. It won’t do to observe that many large corporations have become “bureaucratic” in recent decades. It is a mistake
to believe that this is the result of size. Even the biggest enterprise
remains immune to the dangers of bureaucratism as long as it aims
exclusively at profitability. True, if other considerations are forced on
it, it loses the essential characteristic of a capitalistic enterprise. It was
5

Ibid., p. 184.

114 THE NATIONALIZATION OF CREDIT ?

the prevailing etatistic and interventionistic policies that forced large
enterprises to become more and more bureaucratic. They were forced,
for instance, to appoint executives with good connections to the authorities, rather than able businessmen, or to embark upon unprofitable
operations in order to please influential politicians, political parties,
or government itself. They were forced to continue operations they
wished to abandon, and merge with companies and plants they did not
want. The mixing of politics and business not only is detrimental to
politics, as is frequently observed, but even much more so to business.
Many large enterprises must give thousands of considerations to political matters, which plants the seeds of bureaucratism. But all this does
not justify the proposals to bureaucratize completely and formally all
production through the nationalization of credit. Where would the
German economy be today if credit had been nationalized as early as
1890, or even 1860? Who can be aware of the developments that will
be prevented if it is nationalized today?
3

THE DANGER OF OVEREXPANSION AND IMMOBILIZATION

What has been said here applies to every attempt at transferring private
enterprises, especially the banking system, into the hands of the state,
which in its effects would amount to all-round nationalization. But in
addition, it would create credit problems that must not be overlooked.
Deumer seeks to show that the credit monopoly could not be
abused for fiscal reasons. But the dangers of credit nationalization do
not lie here; they lie with the purchasing power of money.
As is well known, demand deposits subject to checks have the
same effect on the purchasing power of a monetary unit as bank
notes. Deumer even proposes an issue of “guaranteed certificates” or
“clearing house certificates” that are never to be redeemed.6 In short,
the national bank will be in the position to inflate.
Public opinion always wants “easy money,” that is, low interest
rates. But it is the very function of the note-issuing bank to resist such
demands, protecting its own solvency and maintaining the parity of
its notes toward foreign notes and gold. If the bank should be excused
from the redemption of its certificates it would be free to expand its
credits in accordance with the politicians’ wishes. It would be too weak
to resist the clamor of credit applicants. But the banking system is to
be nationalized, in Deumer’s words, “to pay heed to the complaints
6

Ibid., p. 152 et seq.

SUMMATION 115

of small industrial enterprises and many commercial firms that they
are able to secure the necessary credits only with great difficulties and
much sacrifice.”7
A few years ago it would have been necessary to elaborate the
consequences of credit expansion. There is no need for such an effort
today. The relationship between credit expansion and rising goods
prices and foreign exchange rates is well known today. This has been
brought out not only by the research of some economists, but also
by the American and British experiences and theories with which
Germans have become familiar. It would be superfluous to elaborate
further on this.
4

SUMMATION

Deumer’s book clearly reveals that etatism, socialism, and interventionism have run their course. Deumer is unable to support his proposals
with anything but the old etatist and Marxian arguments which have
been refuted a hundred times. He simply ignores the critique of these
arguments. Nor does he consider the problems that arose from recent
socialistic experience. He still takes his stand on the ground of an
ideology that welcomes every nationalization as progress, even though
it has been shaken to its foundations in recent years.
Politics, therefore, will ignore Deumer’s book, which may be regrettable from the author’s viewpoint because he invested labor, ingenuity,
and expertise in his proposals. But in the interest of a healthy recovery
of the German economy, it is gratifying.
