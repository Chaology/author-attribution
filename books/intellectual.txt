In all democratic countries, in the United States even more than elsewhere, a
strong belief prevails that the influence of the intellectuals on politics is negligible. This
is no doubt true of the power of intellectuals to make their peculiar opinions of the
moment influence decisions, of the extent to which they can sway the popular vote on
questions on which they differ from the current views of the masses. Yet over
somewhat longer periods they have probably never exercised so great an influence as
they do today in those countries. This power they wield by shaping public opinion.
In the light of recent history it is somewhat curious that this decisive power of
the professional secondhand dealers in ideas should not yet be more generally
recognized. The political development of the Western World during the last hundred
years furnishes the clearest demonstration. Socialism has never and nowhere been at
first a working-class movement. It is by no means an obvious remedy for the obvious
evil which the interests of that class will necessarily demand. It is a construction of
theorists, deriving from certain tendencies of abstract thought with which for a long
time only the intellectuals were familiar; and it required long efforts by the intellectuals
before the working classes could be persuaded to adopt it as their program.
In every country that has moved toward socialism, the phase of the development
in which socialism becomes a determining influence on politics has been preceded for
many years by a period during which socialist ideals governed the thinking of the more
active intellectuals. In Germany this stage had been reached toward the end of the last
century; in England and France, about the time of the first World War. To the casual
observer it would seem as if the United States had reached this phase after World War II
and that the attractio n of a planned and directed economic system is now as strong
among the American intellectuals as it ever was among their German or English
fellows. Experience suggests that, once this phase has been reached, it is merely a
question of time until the views now held by the intellectuals become the governing
force of politics.

The character of the process by which the views of the intellectuals influence the
politics of tomorrow is therefore of much more than academic interest. Whether we
merely wish to foresee or attempt to influence the course of events, it is a factor of
much greater importance than is generally understood. What to the contemporary
observer appears as the battle of conflicting interests has indeed often been decided long
before in a clash of ideas confined to narrow circles. Paradoxically enough, however, in
general only the parties of the Left have done most to spread the belief that it was the
numerical strength of the opposing material interests which decided political issues,
whereas in practice these same parties have regularly and successfully acted as if they
understood the key position of the intellectuals. Whether by design or driven by the
force of circumstances, they have always directed their main effort toward gaining the
support of this "elite," while the more conservative groups have acted, as regularly but
unsuccessfully, on a more naive view of mass democracy and have usually vainly tried
directly to reach and to persuade the individual voter.
The term "intellectuals," howeve r, does not at once convey a true picture of the
large class to which we refer, and the fact that we have no better name by which to
describe what we have called the secondhand dealers in ideas is not the least of the
reasons why their power is not understood. Even persons who use the word
"intellectual" mainly as a term of abuse are still inclined to withhold it from many who
undoubtedly perform that characteristic function. This is neither that of the original
thinker nor that of the scholar or expert in a particular field of thought. The typical
intellectual need be neither: he need not possess special knowledge of anything in
particular, nor need he even be particularly intelligent, to perform his role as
intermediary in the spreading of ideas. What qualifies him for his job is the wide range
of subjects on which he can readily talk and write, and a position or habits through
which he becomes acquainted with new ideas sooner than those to whom he addresses
himself.
Until one begins to list all the professions and activities which belong to the
class, it is difficult to realize how numerous it is, how the scope for activities constantly
increases in modern society, and how dependent on it we all have become. The class
does not consist of only journalists, teachers, ministers, lecturers, publicists, radio
commentators, writers of fiction, cartoonists, and artists all of whom may be masters of
the technique of conveying ideas but are usually amateurs so far as the substance of
what they convey is concerned. The class also includes many professional men and
technicians, such as scientists and doctors, who through their habitual intercourse with
the printed word become carriers of new ideas outside their own fields and who,
because of their expert knowledge of their own subjects, are listened with respect on
most others. There is little that the ordinary man of today learns about events or ideas
except through the medium of this class; and outside our special fields of work we are
in this respect almost all ordinary men, dependent for our information and instruction on
those who make it their job to keep abreast of opinion. It is the intellectuals in this sense
who decide what views and opinions are to reach us, which facts are important enough
372

to be told to us, and in what form and from what angle they are to be presented.
Whether we shall ever learn of the results of the work of the expert and the original
thinker depends mainly on their decision.
The layman, perhaps, is not fully aware to what extent even the popular
reputations of scientists and scholars are made by that class and are inevitably affected
by its views on subjects which have little to do with the merits of the real achievements.
And it is specially significant for our problem that every scholar can probably name
several instances from his field of men who have undeservedly achieved a popular
reputation as great scientists solely because they hold what the intellectuals regard as
"progressive" political views; but I have yet to come across a single instance where such
a scientific pseudo-reputation has been bestowed for political reason on a scholar of
more conservative leanings. This creation of reputations by the intellectuals is
particularly important in the fields where the results of expert studies are not used by
other specialists but depend on the political decision of the public at large. There is
indeed scarcely a better illustration of this than the attitude which professional
economists have taken to the growth of such doctrines as socialism or protectionism.
There was probably at no time a majority of economists, who were recognized as such
by their peers, favorable to socialism (or, for that matter, to protection). In all
probability it is even true to say that no other similar group of students contains so high
a proportion of its members decidedly opposed to socialism (or protection). This is the
more significant as in recent times it is as likely as not that it was an early interest in
socialist schemes for reform which led a man to choose economics for his profession.
Yet it is not the predominant views of the experts but the views of a minority, mostly of
rather doubtful standing in their profession, which are taken up and spread by the
intellectuals.
The all-pervasive influence of the intellectuals in contemporary society is still
further strengthened by the growing importance of "organization." It is a common but
probably mistaken belief that the increase of organization increases the influence of the
expert or specialist. This may be true of the expert administrator and organizer, if there
are such people, but hardly of the expert in any particular field of knowledge. It is rather
the person whose general knowledge is supposed to qualify him to appreciate expert
testimony, and to judge between the experts from different fields, whose power is
enhanced. The point which is important for us, however, is that the scholar who
becomes a university president, the scientist who takes charge of an institute or
foundation, the scholar who becomes an editor or the active promoter of an
organization serving a particular cause, all rapidly cease to be scholars or experts and
become intellectuals, solely in the light of certain fashionable general ideas. The
number of such institutions which breed intellectuals and increase their number and
powers grows every day. Almost all the "experts" in the mere technique of getting
knowledge over are, with respect to the subject matter which they handle, intellectuals
and not experts.
373

In the sense in which we are using the term, the intellectuals are in fact a fairly
new phenomenon of history. Though nobody will regret that education has ceased to be
a privilege of the propertied classes, the fact that the propertied classes are no longer the
best educated and the fact that the large number of people who owe their position solely
to the their general education do not possess that experience of the working of the
economic system which the administration of property gives, are important for
understanding the role of the intellectual. Professor Schumpeter, who has devoted an
illuminating chapter of his Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy to some aspects of
our problem, has not unfairly stressed that it is the absence of direct responsibility for
practical affairs and the consequent absence of first hand knowledge of them which
distinguishes the typical intellectual from other people who also wield the power of the
spoken and written word. It would lead too far, however, to examine here further the
development of this class and the curious claim which has recently been advanced by
one of its theorists that it was the only one whose views were not decidedly influenced
by its own economic interests. One of the important points that would have to be
examined in such a discussion would be how far the growth of this class has been
artificially stimulated by the law of copyright.
It is not surprising that the real scholar or expert and the practical man of affairs
often feel contemptuous about the intellectual, are disinclined to recognize his power,
and are resentful when they discover it. Individually they find the intellectuals mostly to
be people who understand nothing in particular especially well and whose judgement on
matters they themselves understand shows little sign of special wisdom. But it would be
a fatal mistake to underestimate their power for this reason. Even though their
knowledge may often be superficial and their intelligence limited, this does not alter the
fact that it is their judgement which mainly determines the views on which society will
act in the not too distant future. It is no exaggeration to say that, once the more active
part of the intellectuals has been converted to a set of beliefs, the process by which
these become generally accepted is almost automatic and irresistible. These intellectuals
are the organs which modern society has developed for spreading knowledge and ideas,
and it is their convictions and opinions which operate as the sieve through which all
new conceptions must pass before they can reach the masses.
It is of the nature of the intellectual's job that he must use his own knowledge
and convictions in performing his daily task. He occupies his position because he
possesses, or has had to deal from day to day with, knowledge which his employer in
general does not possess, and his activities can therefore be directed by others only to
a limited extent. And just because the intellectuals are mostly intellectually honest, it is
inevitable that they should follow their own conviction whenever they have discretion
and that they should give a corresponding slant to everything that passes through their
hands. Even where the direction of policy is in the hands of men of affairs of different
views, the execution of policy will in general be in the hands of intellectuals, and it is
frequently the decision on the detail which determines the net effect. We find this
illustrated in almost all fields of contemporary society. Newspapers in "capitalist"
374

ownership, universities presided over by "reactionary" governing bodies, broadcasting
systems owned by conservative governments, have all been known to influence public
opinion in the direction of socialism, because this was the conviction of the personnel.
This has often happened not only in spite of, but perhaps even because of, the attempts
of those at the top to control opinion and to impose principles of orthodoxy.
The effect of this filtering of ideas through the convictions of a class which is
constitutionally disposed to certain views is by no means confined to the masses.
Outside his special field the expert is generally no less dependent on this class and
scarcely less influenced by their selection. The result of this is that today in most parts
of the Western World even the most determined opponents of socialism derive from
socialist sources their knowledge on most subjects on which they have no firsthand
information. With many of the more general preconceptions of socialist thought, the
connection of their more practical proposals is by no means at once obvious; in
consequence of that system of thought become in fact effective spreaders of its ideas.
Who does not know the practical man who in his own field denounces socialism as
"pernicious rot" but, when he steps outside his subject, spouts socialism like any left
journalist? In no other field has the predominant influence of the socialist intellectuals
been felt more strongly during the last hundred years than in the contacts between
different national civilizations. It would go far beyond the limits of this article to trace
the causes and significance of the highly important fact that in the modern world the
intellectuals provide almost the only approach to an international community. It is this
which mainly accounts for the extraordinary spectacle that for generations the
supposedly "capitalist" West has been lending its moral and material support almost
exclusively to those ideological movements in countries father east which aimed at
undermining Western civilization and that, at the same time, the information which the
Western public has obtained about events in Central and Eastern Europe has almost
inevitably been colored by a socialist bias. Many of the "educational" activities of the
American forces of occupation of Germany have furnished clear and recent examples of
this tendency.
A proper understanding of the reasons which tend to incline so many of the
intellectuals toward socialism is thus most important. The first point here which those
who do not share this bias ought to face frankly is that it is neither selfish interests nor
evil intentions but mostly honest convictions and good intentions which determine the
intellectual's views. In fact, it is necessary to recognize that on the whole the typical
intellectual is today more likely to be a socialist the more he his guided by good will
and intelligence, and that on the plane of purely intellectual argument he will generally
be able to make out a better case than the majority of his opponents within his class. If
we still think him wrong, we must recognize that it may be genuine error which leads
the well- meaning and intelligent people who occupy those key positions in our society

375

to spread views which to us appear a threat to our civilization. 1 Nothing could be more
important than to try to understand the sources of this error in order that we should be
able to counter it. Yet those who are generally regarded as the representatives of the
existing order and who believe that they comprehend the dangers of socialism are
usually very far from such understanding. They tend to regard the socialist intellectuals
as nothing more than a pernicious bunch of highbrow radicals without appreciating their
influence and, by their whole attitude to them, tend to drive them even further into
opposition to the existing order.
If we are to understand this peculiar bias of a large section of intellectuals, we
must be clear about two points. The first is that they generally judge all particular issues
exclusively in the light of certain general ideas; the second, that the characteristic errors
of any age are frequently derived from some genuine new truths it has discovered, and
they are erroneous applications of new generalizations which have proved their value in
other fields. The conclusion to which we shall be led by a full consideration of these
facts will be that the effective refutation of such errors will frequently require further
intellectual advance, and often advance on points which are very abstract and may seem
very remote from the practical issues.
It is perhaps the most characteristic feature of the intellectual that he judges new
ideas not by their specific merits but by the readiness with which they fit into his
general conceptions, into the picture of the world which he regards as modern or
advanced. It is through their influence on him and on his choice of opinions on
particular issues that the power of ideas for good and evil grows in proportion to their
generality, abstractness, and even vagueness. As he knows little about the particular
issues, his criterion must be consistency with his other views and suitability for
combining into a coherent picture of the world. Yet this selection from the multitude of
new ideas presenting themselves at every moment creates the characteristic climate of
opinion, the dominant Weltanschauung of a period, which will be favorable to the
reception of some opinions and unfavorable to others and which will make the
intellectual readily accept one conclusion and reject another without a real
understanding of the issues.
In some respects the intellectual is indeed closer to the philosopher than to any
specialist, and the philosopher is in more than one sense a sort of prince among the
intellectuals. Although his influence is farther removed from practical affairs and
correspondingly slower and more difficult to trace than that of the ordinary intellectual,
it is of the same kind and in the long run even more powerful than that of the latter. It is
the same endeavor toward a synthesis, pursued more methodically, the same judgement
of particular views in so far as they fit into a general system of thought rather than by
their specific merits, the same striving after a consistent world view, which for both
1

It was therefore not (as has been suggested by one reviewer of The Road to Serfdom, Professor J.
Schumpeter), "politeness to a fault" but profound conviction of the importance of this which made me, in
Professor Schumpeter's words, "hardly ever attribute to opponents anything beyond intellectual error."

376

forms the main basis for accepting or rejecting ideas. For this reason the philosopher
has probably a greater influence over the intellectuals than any other scholar or scientist
and, more than anyone else, determines the manner in which the intellectuals exercise
their censorship function. The popular influence of the scientific specialist begins to
rival that of the philosopher only when he ceases to be a specialist and commences to
philosophize about the progress of his subject and usually only after he has been taken
up by the intellectuals for reasons which have little to do with his scientific eminence.
The "climate of opinion" of any period is thus essentially a set of very general
preconceptions by which the intellectual judges the importance of new facts and
opinions. These preconceptions are mainly applications to what seem to him the most
significant aspects of scientific achievements, a transfer to other fields of what has
particularly impressed him in the work of the specialists. One could give a long list of
such intellectual fashions and catchwords which in the course of two or three
generations have in turn dominated the thinking of the intellectuals. Whether it was the
"historical approach" or the theory of evolution, nineteenth century determinism and the
belief in the predominant influence of environment as against heredity, the theory of
relativity or the belief in the power of the unconscious- every one of these general
conceptions has been made the touchstone by which innovations in different fields have
been tested. It seems as if the less specific or precise (or the less understood) these ideas
are, the wider may be their influence. Sometimes it is no more than a vague impression
rarely put into words which thus wields a profound influence. Such beliefs as that
deliberate control or conscious organization is also in social affairs always superior to
the results of spontaneous processes which are not directed by a human mind, or that
any order based on a plan laid down beforehand must be better than one formed by the
balancing of opposing forces, have in this way profoundly affected political
development.
Only apparently different is the role of the intellectuals where the development
of more properly social ideas is concerned. Here their peculiar propensities manifest
themselves in making shibboleths of abstractions, in rationalizing and carrying to
extremes certain ambitions which spring from the normal intercourse of men. Since
democracy is a good thing, the further the democratic principle can be carried, the better
it appears to them. The most powerful of these general ideas which have shaped
political development in recent times is of course the ideal of material equality. It is,
characteristically, not one of the spontaneously grown moral convictions, first applied
in the relations between particular individuals, but an intellectual construction originally
conceived in the abstract and of doubtful meaning or application in particular instances.
Nevertheless, it has operated strongly as a principle of selection among the alternative
courses of social policy, exercising a persistent pressure toward an arrangement of
social affairs which nobody clearly conceives. That a particular measure tends to bring
about greater equality has come to be regarded as so strong a recommendation that little
else will be considered. Since on each particular issue it is this one aspect on which
377

those who guide opinion have a definite conviction, equality has determined social
change even more strongly than its advocates intended.
Not only moral ideals act in this manner, however. Sometimes the attitudes of
the intellectuals toward the problems of social order may be the consequence of
advances in purely scientific knowledge, and it is in these instances that their erroneous
views on particular issues may for a time seem to have all the prestige of the latest
scientific achievements behind them. It is not in itself surprising that a genuine advance
of knowledge should in this manner become on occasion a source of new error. If no
false conclusions followed from new generalizations, they would be final truths which
would never need revision. Although as a rule such a new generalization will merely
share the false consequences which can be drawn from it with the views which were
held before, and thus not lead to new error, it is quite likely that a new theory, just as its
value is shown by the valid new conclusions to which it leads, will produce other new
conclusions to which further advance will show to have been erroneous. But in such an
instance a false belief will appear with all the prestige of the latest scientific knowledge
supporting it. Although in the particular field to which this belief applies all the
scientific evidence may be against it, it will nevertheless, before the tribunal of the
intellectuals and in the light of the ideas which govern their thinking, be selected as the
view which is best in accord with the spirit of the time. The specialists who will thus
achieve public fame and wide influence will thus not be those who have gained
recognition by their peers but will often be men whom the other experts regard as
cranks, amateurs, or even frauds, but who in the eyes of the general public nevertheless
become the best known exponents of their subject.
In particular, there can be little doubt that the manner in which during the last
hundred years man has learned to organize the forces of nature has contributed a great
deal toward the creation of the belief that a similar control of the forces of society
would bring comparable improvements in human conditions. That, with the application
of engineering techniques, the direction of all forms of human activity according to a
single coherent plan should prove to be as successful in society as it has been in
innumerable engineering tasks, is too plausible a conclusion not to seduce most of those
who are elated by the achievement of the natural sciences. It must indeed be admitted
both that it would require powerful arguments to counter the strong presumption in
favor of such a conclusion and that these arguments have not yet been adequately
stated. It is not sufficient to point out the defects of particular proposals based on this
kind of reasoning. The argument will not lose its force until it has been conclusively
shown why what has proved so eminently successful in producing advances in so many
fields should have limits to its usefulness and become positively harmful if extended
beyond these limits. This is a task which has not yet been satisfactorily performed and
which will have to be achieved before this particular impulse toward socialism can be
removed.

378

This, of course, is only one of many instances where further intellectual advance
is needed if the harmful ideas at present current are to be refuted and where the course
which we shall travel will ultimately be decided by the discussion of very abstract
issues. It is not enough for the man of affairs to be sure, from his intimate knowledge of
a particular field, that the theories of socialism which are derived from more general
ideas will prove impracticable. He may be perfectly right, and yet his resistance will be
overwhelmed and all the sorry consequences which he foresees will follow if his is not
supported by an effective refutation of the idees meres. So long as the intellectual gets
the better of the general argument, the most valid objections of the specific issue will be
brushed aside.
This is not the whole story, however. The forces which influence recruitment to
the ranks of the intellectuals operate in the same direction and help to explain why so
many of the most able among them lean toward socialism. There are of course as many
differences of opinion among intellectuals as among other groups of people; but it
seems to be true that it is on the whole the more active, intelligent, and original men
among the intellectuals who most frequently incline toward socialism, while its
opponents are often of an inferior caliber. This is true particularly during the early
stages of the infiltration of socialist ideas; later, although outside intellectual circles it
may still be an act of courage to profess socialist convictions, the pressure of opinion
among intellectuals will often be so strongly in favor of socialism that it requires more
strength and independence for a man to resist it than to join in what his fellows regard
as modern views. Nobody, for instance, who is familiar with large numbers of
university faculties (and from this point of view the majority of university teachers
probably have to be classed as intellectuals rather than as experts) can remain oblivious
to the fact that the most brilliant and successful teachers are today more likely than not
to be socialists, while those who hold more conservative political views are as
frequently mediocrities. This is of course by itself an important factor leading the
younger generation into the socialist camp.
The socialist will, of course, see in this merely a proof that the more intelligent
person is today bound to become a socialist. But this is far from being the necessary or
even the most likely explanation. The main reason for this state of affairs is probably
that, for the exceptionally able man who accepts the present order of society, a
multitude of other avenues to influence and power are open, while to the disaffected and
dissatisfied an intellectual career is the most promising path to both influence and the
power to contribute to the achievement of his ideals. Even more than that: the more
conservatively inclined man of first class ability will in general choose intellectual work
(and the sacrifice in material reward which this choice usually entails) only if he enjoys
it for its own sake. He is in consequence more likely to become an expert scholar rather
than an intellectual in the specific sense of the word; while to the more radically minded
the intellectual pursuit is more often than not a means rather than an end, a path to
exactly that kind of wide influence which the professional intellectual exercises. It is
therefore probably the fact, not that the more intelligent people are generally socialists,
379

but that a much higher proportion of socialists among the best minds devote themselves
to those intellectual pursuits which in modern society give them a decisive influence on
public opinion. 2
The selection of the personnel of the intellectuals is also closely connected with
the predominant interest which they show in general and abstract ideas. Speculations
about the possible entire reconstruction of society give the intellectual a fare much more
to his taste than the more practical and short-run considerations of those who aim at a
piecemeal improvement of the existing order. In particular, socialist thought owes its
appeal to the young largely to its visionary character; the very courage to indulge in
Utopian thought is in this respect a source of strength to the socialists which traditional
liberalism sadly lacks. This difference operates in favor of socialism, not only because
speculation about general principles provides an opportunity for the play of the
imagination of those who are unencumbered by much knowledge of the facts of
present-day life, but also because it satisfies a legitimate desire for the understanding of
the rational basis of any social order and gives scope for the exercise of that
constructive urge for which liberalism, after it had won its great victories, left few
outlets. The intellectual, by his whole disposition, is uninterested in technical details or
practical difficulties. What appeal to him are the broad visions, the spacious
comprehension of the social order as a whole which a planned system promises.
This fact that the tastes of the intellectual were better satisfied by the
speculations of the socialists proved fatal to the influence of the liberal tradition. Once
the basic demands of the liberal programs seemed satisfied, the liberal thinkers turned to
problems of detail and tended to neglect the development of the general philosophy of
liberalism, which in consequence ceased to be a live issue offering scope for general
speculation. Thus for something over half a century it has been only the socialists who
have offered anything like an explicit program of social development, a picture of the
future society at which they were aiming, and a set of general principles to guide
decisions on particular issues. Even though, if I am right, their ideals suffer from
inherent contradictions, and any attempt to put them into practice must produce
something utterly different from what they expect, this does not alter the fact that their
program for change is the only one which has actually influenced the development of
social institutions. It is because theirs has become the only explicit general philosophy
of social policy held by a large group, the only system or theory which raises new
problems and opens new horizons, that they have succeeded in inspiring the
imagination of the intellectuals.
2

Related to this is another familiar phenomenon: there is little reason to believe that really first class
intellectual ability for original work is any rarer among Gentiles than among Jews. Yet there can be little
doubt that men of Jewish stock almost everywhere constitute a disproportionately large number of the
intellectuals in our sense, that is of the ranks of the professional interpreters of ideas. This may be their
special gift and certainly is their main opportunity in countries where prejudice puts obstacles in their
way in other fields. It is probably more because they constitute so large a proportion of the intellectuals
than for any other reason that they seem to be so much more receptive of socialist ideas than people of
different stocks.

380

The actual developments of society during this period were determined, not by a
battle of conflicting ideals, but by the contrast between an existing state of affairs and
that one ideal of a possible future society which the socialists alone held up before the
public. Very few of the other programs which offered themselves provided genuine
alternatives. Most of them were mere compromises or half- way houses between the
more extreme types of socialism and the existing order. All that was needed to make
almost any socialist proposal appear reasonable to these "judicious" minds who were
constitutionally convinced that the truth must always lie in the middle between the
extremes, was for someone to advocate a sufficiently more extreme proposal. There
seemed to exist only one direction in which we could move, and the only question
seemed to be how fast and how far the movement should proceed.
The significance of the special appeal to the intellectuals which socialism
derives from its speculative character will become clearer if we further contrast the
position of the socialist theorist with that of his counterpart who is a liberal in the old
sense of the word. This comparison will also lead us to whatever lesson we can draw
from an adequate appreciation of the intellectual forces which are undermining the
foundations of a free society.
Paradoxically enough, one of the main handicaps which deprives the liberal
thinker of popular influence is closely connected with the fact that, until socialism has
actually arrived, he has more opportunity of directly influencing decisions on current
policy and that in consequence he is not only not tempted into that long-run speculation
which is the strength of the socialists, but is actually discouraged from it because any
effort of this kind is likely to reduce the immediate good he can do. Whatever power he
has to influence practical decisions he owes to his standing with the representatives of
the existing order, and this standing he would endanger if he devoted himself to the kind
of speculation which would appeal to the intellectuals and which through them could
influence developments over longer periods. In order to carry weight with the powers
that be, he has to be "practical," "sensible," and "realistic." So long as he concerns
himself with the immediate issues, he is rewarded with influence, material success, and
popularity with those who up to a point share his general outlook. But these men have
little respect for those speculations on general principles which shape the intellectual
climate. Indeed, if he seriously indulges in such long-run speculation, he is apt to
acquire the reputation of being "unsound" or even half a socialist, because he is
unwilling to identify the existing order with the free system at which he aims. 3

3

The most glaring recent example of such condemnation of a somewhat unorthodox liberal work as
"socialist" has been provided by some comments on the late Henry Simons' Economic Policy for a Free
Society (1948). One need not agree with the whole of this work and one may even regard some of the
suggestions made in it as incompatible with a free society, and yet recognize it as one of the most
important contributions made in recent times to our problem and as just the kind of work which is
required to get discussion started on the fundamental issues. Even those who violently disagree with some

381

If, in spite of this, his efforts continue in the direction of general speculation, he
soon discovers that it is unsafe to associate too closely with those who seem to share
most of his convictions, and he is soon driven into isolation. Indeed there can be few
more thankless tasks at present than the essential one of developing the philosophical
foundation on which the further development of a free society must be based. Since the
man who undertakes it must accept much of the framework of the existing order, he will
appear to many of the more speculatively minded intellectuals merely as a timid
apologist of things as they are; at the same time he will be dismissed by the men of
affairs as an impractical theorist. He is not radical enough for those who know only the
world where "with ease together dwell the thoughts" and much too radical for those
who see only how "hard in space together clash the things." If he takes advantage of
such support as he can get from the men of affairs, he will almost certainly discredit
himself with those on whom he depends for the spreading of his ideas. At the same time
he will need most carefully to avoid anything resembling extravagance or
overstatement. While no socialist theorist has ever been known to discredit himself with
his fellows even by the silliest of proposals, the old- fashioned liberal will damn himself
by an impracticable suggestion. Yet for the intellectuals he will still not be speculative
or adventurous enough, and the changes and improvements in the social structure he
will have to offer will seem limited in comparison with what their less restrained
imagination conceives.
At least in a society in which the main requisites of freedom have already been
won and further improvements must concern points of comparative detail, the liberal
program can have none of the glamour of a new invention. The appreciation of the
improvements it has to offer requires more knowledge of the working of the existing
society than the average intellectual possesses. The discussion of these improvements
must proceed on a more practical level than that of the more revolutionary programs,
thus giving a complexion which has little appeal for the intellectual and tending to bring
in elements to whom he feels directly antagonistic. Those who are most familiar with
the working of the present society are also usually interested in the preservation of
particular features of that society which may not be defensible on general principles.
Unlike the person who looks for an entirely new future order and who naturally turns
for guidance to the theorist, the men who believe in the existing order also usually think
that they understand it much better than any theorist and in consequence are likely to
reject whatever is unfamiliar and theoretical.
The difficulty of finding genuine and disinterested support for a systematic
policy for freedom is not new. In a passage of which the reception of a recent book of
mine has often reminded me, Lord Acton long ago described how "at all times sincere
friends of freedom have been rare, and its triumphs have been due to minorities, that
have prevailed by associating themselves with auxiliaries whose objects differed from
their own; and this association, which is always dangerous, has been sometimes
of its suggestions should welcome it as a contribution which clearly and courageously raises the central
problems of our time.

disastrous, by giving to opponents just grounds of opposition...."4 More recently, one of
the most distinguished living American economists has complained in a similar vein
that the main task of those who believe in the basic principles of the capitalist system
must frequently be to defend this system against the capitalists--indeed the great liberal
economists, from Adam Smith to the present, have always known this.
The most serious obstacle which separates the practical men who have the cause
of freedom genuinely at heart from those forces which in the realm of ideas decide the
course of development is their deep distrust of theoretical speculation and their
tendency to orthodoxy; this, more than anything else, creates an almost impassable
barrier between them and those intellectuals who are devoted to the same cause and
whose assistance is indispensable if the cause is to prevail. Although this tendency is
perhaps natural among men who defend a system because it has justified itself in
practice, and to whom its intellectual justification seems immaterial, it is fatal to its
survival because it deprives it of the support it most needs. Orthodoxy of any kind, any
pretense that a system of ideas is final and must be unquestioningly accepted as a
whole, is the one view which of necessity antagonizes all intellectuals, whatever their
views on particular issues. Any system which judges men by the completeness of their
conformity to a fixed set of opinions, by their "soundness" or the extent to which they
can be relied upon to hold approved views on all points, deprives itself of a support
without which no set of ideas can maintain its influence in modern society. The ability
to criticize accepted views, to explore new vistas and to experience with new
conceptions, provides the atmosphere without which the intellectual cannot breathe. A
cause which offers no scope for these traits can have no support from him and is thereby
doomed in any society which, like ours, rests on his services.
It may be that as a free society as we have known it carries in itself the forces of
its own destruction, that once freedom has been achieved it is taken for granted and
ceases to be valued, and that the free growth of ideas which is the essence of a free
society will bring about the destruction of the foundations on which it depends. There
can be little doubt that in countries like the United States the ideal of freedom today has
less real appeal for the young than it has in countries where they have learned what its
loss means. On the other hand, there is every sign that in Germany and elsewhere, to the
young men who have never known a free society, the task of constructing one can
become as exciting and fascinating as any socialist scheme which has appeared during
the last hundred years. It is an extraordinary fact, though one which many visitors have
experienced, that in speaking to German students about the principles of a liberal
society one finds a more responsive and even enthusiastic audience than one can hope
to find in any of the Western democracies. In Britain also there is already appearing
among the young a new interest in the principles of true liberalism which certainly did
not exist a few years ago.

Does this mean that freedom is valued only when it is lost, that the world must
everywhere go through a dark phase of socialist totalitarianism before the forces of
freedom can gather strength anew? It may be so, but I hope it need not be. Yet, so long
as the people who over longer periods determine public opinion continue to be attracted
by the ideals of socialism, the trend will continue. If we are to avoid such a
development, we must be able to offer a new liberal program which appeals to the
imagination. We must make the building of a free society once more an intellectual
adventure, a deed of courage. What we lack is a liberal Utopia, a program which seems
neither a mere defense of things as they are nor a diluted kind of socialism, but a truly
liberal radicalism which does not spare the susceptibilities of the mighty (including the
trade unions), which is not too severely practical, and which does not confine itself to
what appears today as politically possible. We need intellectual leaders who are willing
to work for an ideal, however small may be the prospects of its early realization. They
must be men who are willing to stick to principles and to fight for their full realization,
however remote. The practical compromises they must leave to the politicians. Free
trade and freedom of opportunity are ideals which still may arouse the imaginations of
large numbers, but a mere "reasonable freedom of trade" or a mere "relaxation of
controls" is neither intellectually respectable nor likely to inspire any enthusiasm.
The main lesson which the true liberal must learn from the success of the
socialists is that it was their courage to be Utopian which gained them the support of the
intellectuals and therefore an influence on public opinion which is daily making
possible what only recently seemed utterly remote. Those who have concerned
themselves exclusively with what seemed practicable in the existing state of opinion
have constantly found that even this had rapidly become politically impossible as the
result of changes in a public opinion which they have done nothing to guide. Unless we
can make the philosophic foundations of a free society once more a living intellectual
issue, and its implementation a task which challenges the ingenuity and imagination of
our liveliest minds. But if we can regain that belief in the power of ideas which was the
mark of liberalism at its best, the battle is not lost. The intellectual revival of liberalism
is already underway in many parts of the world. Will it be in time?
