EDITORIAL FOREWORD

EDITORIAL FOREWORD

I
The Fatal Conceit, here published in paperback, is a new work by Hayek.
It was first published in 1988 as the first volume to appear in The
Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, a new standard edition of his writings.
The reader who is struck by the pace and freshness of the argument
of this new book, its vigorous application to specific cases, and its
occasionally polemical thrust will want to know something of its
background. In 1978, at the age of nearly eighty, and after a lifetime of
doing battle with socialism in its many manifestations, Hayek wanted to
have a showdown. He conceived of a grand formal debate, probably to
be held in Paris, in which the leading theorists of socialism would face
the leading intellectual advocates of the market order. They would
address the question: `Was Socialism a Mistake?'. The advocates of the
market order would argue that socialism was - and always had been thoroughly mistaken on scientific and factual, even logical grounds, and
that its repeated failures, in the many different practical applications of
socialist ideas that this century has witnessed, were, on the whole, the
direct outcome of these scientific errors.
The idea of a grand formal debate had to be set aside for practical
reasons. How, for instance, would the representatives of socialism be
chosen? Would socialists themselves not refuse to agree on who might
represent them? And even in the unlikely event that they did agree,
could they be expected to acknowledge the real outcome of any such
debate? Public confessions of error do not come easily.
Yet those of his colleagues who had met with Hayek to discuss the
idea were reluctant to abandon it, and encouraged him to set down, in a
manifesto, the main arguments in the free-market case. What was
intended as a brief manifesto first grew into a large work in three parts;
then the whole was compressed into the short book - or longer
manifesto - presented here. Some fragments of the larger work have
been preserved, and will be published separately in Volume X.
Adopting an economic and evolutionary approach throughout, Hayek
examines the nature, origin, selection and development of the differing
x

moralities of socialism and the market order; he recounts the
extraordinary powers that `the extended order' of the market, as he calls
it, bestows on mankind, constituting and enabling the development of
civilisation. Hayek also weighs - in a manner occasionally reminiscent
of Freud's Civilisation and Its Discontents, yet reaching very different
conclusions - both the benefits and costs of this civilisation, and also the
consequences that would ensue from the destruction of the market
order. He concludes: `While facts alone can never determine what is
right, ill-considered notions of what is reasonable, right and good may
change the facts and the circumstances in which we live; they may
destroy, perhaps forever, not only developed individuals and buildings
and art and cities (which we have long known to be vulnerable to the
destructive powers of moralities and ideologies of various sorts), but
also traditions, institutions, and interrelations without which such
creations could hardly have come into being or ever be recreated.'

II
The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek attempts to make virtually the
entire Hayek corpus available to the reader for the first time. The chief
organisation is thematic, but within this structure a chronological order
is followed where possible.
The series opens with two closely-related books on the limits of
reason and planning in the social sciences - The Fatal Conceit, a new
work, and The Uses and Abuses of Reason: The Counter-Revolution of Science,
and Other Essays, a work never previously published in Britain. The
series continues with two collections of historical and biographical
essays ( The Trend of Economic Thinking and The Austrian School and the
Fortunes of Liberalism). The essays in these two volumes have never
before been collected; over half of them have previously been available
only in German; and approximately one-third of the first of these
volumes is drawn from important manuscripts never previously
published.
The series continues with four volumes encompassing the bulk of
Hayek's contributions to economics: Nations and Gold; Money and Nations;
Investigations in Economics; and Monetary Theory and Industrial Fluctuations.
These volumes are followed by three volumes of documentation,
historical record and debate: The Battle with Keynes and Cambridge; The
Battle with Socialism; and the remarkable Correspondence Between Karl
Popper and F. A. Hayek, extending over fifty years, in which these close
friends and intellectual collaborators intensely debate the main
problems of philosophy and methodology, and many of the principal
issues of our time.

EDITORIAL FOREWORD

EDITORIAL FOREWORD

These documentary volumes are followed by two new collections of
essays by Hayek, and by a volume of his interviews and informal
conversations about both theoretical issues and practical affairs Conversations with Hayek - a volume intended to make his ideas available
to a wider readership.
These first fourteen volumes will draw on, and be in large part
created from, the resources of the large Hayek Archive at the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, Stanford University, as well
as its closely-related Machlup Archive and Popper Archive. Numerous
other rich archival resources throughout the world will also be used.
The first volume in the series, The Fatal Conceit, which is fresh from
Hayek's hand, is of course unburdened by critical apparatus. The texts
of subsequent volumes will be published in corrected, revised and
annotated form, with introductions by distinguished scholars intended
to place them in their historial and theoretical context.
The series will conclude with eight of Hayek's classic works i ncluding The Road to Serfdom, Individualism and Economic Order, The
Constitution of Liberty, and Law, Legislation and Liberty - books that are at
the moment still readily available in other editions. It is assumed that
the publication of the entire series will take ten to twelve years.
It is the intention of the editors that the series of volumes be complete
i n so far as that is reasonable and responsible. Thus essays which exist
i n slightly variant forms, or in several different languages, will be
published always in English or in English translation, and only in their
most complete and finished form unless some variation, or the timing
thereof, is of theoretical or historical significance. Some items of
ephemeral value, such as short newspaper articles and book notices of a
few lines written when Hayek was editing Economica, will be omitted.
And of course the correspondence to be published will be mainly that
which bears significantly on Hayek's literary and theoretical work in
economics, psychology, biography and history, political theory, and
philosophy. All materials used in the creation of these volumes, as well
as those comparatively few items omitted, will be available to scholars
in the Hoover Institution Archives.

The presiding genius behind the larger project, without whose advice
and support it never could have been organised or launched, is Walter
S. Morris, of the Vera and Walter Morris Foundation. Two other
institutions whose directors watched carefully over the inception of the
project, and whose advice has been ,invaluable, are the Institute for
Humane Studies, George Mason University, and the Institute of
Economic Affairs, in London. The editor is particularly indebted to
Leonard P. Liggio, Walter Grinder, and John Blundell, of the Institute
for Humane Studies; and to Lord Harris of High Cross and John B.
Wood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Equally important has been
the unflagging support and advice of Norman Franklin of Routledge &
Kegan Paul, Ltd., London, who has been Hayek's publisher for many
years. Finally, the project could not have been carried through
successfully without the generous financial support of the supporting
organisations, whose names are listed prominently at the beginning of
this volume, and to which all associated with the volume are deeply
grateful. The support of these sponsors - institutions and foundations
from six continents - not only acknowledges the international appreciation of Hayek's work, but also provides very tangible evidence of the
` extended order of human cooperation' of which Hayek writes. The
Editor also wishes to acknowledge grants in aid of the project from
the Werner Erhard Foundation, Sausalito, California, and from the
Thyssen Foundation, Cologne, West Germany.

The preparation of a standard edition of this type is a large and also
expensive undertaking. First and foremost among those who are to be
thanked for their very great assistance are W. Glenn Campbell, Director
of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, Stanford
University, for the generous decision to provide the principal underlying
support for this project, and also for the editor's biography of Hayek.

PREFACE

For this book I adopted two rules. There were to be no footnotes and all
arguments not essential to its chief conclusions but of interest or even
essential to the specialist were either to be put into smaller print to tell
the general reader that he might pass over them without missing points
on which the conclusions depended, or else were to be assembled in
appendices.
References to works cited or quoted are therefore usually indicated
simply by brief statements in brackets of the name of the author (where
not clear from the context) and the date of the work, followed after a
colon by page numbers where needed. These refer to the list of
authorities quoted at the end of the volume. Where a later edition of a
work has been used, this is indicated by the latter of the dates given in
the form 1786/1973, where the former date refers to the original edition.
It would be impossible to name the obligations one has incurred in
the course of a long life of study even if one were to list all the works
from which one has acquired one's knowledge and opinions, and still
more impossible to list in a bibliography all the works one knows one
ought to have studied in order to claim competence in a field as wide as
that with which the present work deals. Nor can I hope to list all the
personal obligations I have incurred during the many years my efforts
were directed towards what was fundamentally the same goal. I wish,
however, to express my deep gratitude to Miss Charlotte Cubitt, who
has served as my assistant throughout the period that this work was in
preparation and without whose dedicated help it never could have been
completed; and also to Professor W. W. Bartley, III, of the Hoover
Institution, Stanford University, who - when I fell ill for a time, just
prior to the completion of the final draft - took this volume in hand and
prepared it for the publishers.

WAS SOCIALISM A MISTAKE?

INTRODUCTION
WAS SOCIALISM A MISTAKE?

The idea of Socialism is at once grandiose and simple.... We may say,
in fact, that it is one of the most ambitious creations of the human spirit,
. . . so magnificent, so daring, that it has rightly aroused the greatest
admiration. If we wish to save the world from barbarism we have to
refute Socialism, but we cannot thrust it carelessly aside.
Ludwig von Mises
This book argues that our civilisation depends, not only for its origin but
also for its preservation, on what can be precisely described only as the
extended order of human cooperation, an order more commonly, if somewhat misleadingly, known as capitalism. To understand our civilisation,
one must appreciate that the extended order resulted not from human
design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally
conforming to certain traditional and largely moral practices, many of
which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to
understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection - the
comparative increase of population and wealth - of those groups that
happened to follow them. The unwitting, reluctant, even painful adoption
of these practices kept these groups together, increased their access to
valuable information of all sorts, and enabled them to be `fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it' ( Genesis 1:28). This
process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.
Socialists take a different view of these matters. They not only differ
in their conclusions, they see the facts differently. That socialists are
wrong about the facts is crucial to my argument, as it will unfold in the
pages that follow. I am prepared to admit that if socialist analyses of the
operation of the existing economic order, and of possible alternatives,
were factually correct,-. we might be obliged to ensure that the
distribution of incomes conform to certain moral principles, and that
this distribution might be possible only by giving a central authority the
power to direct the use of available resources, and might presuppose the
abolition of individual ownership of means of production. If it were for
instance true that central direction of the means of production could
6

effect a collective product of at least the same magnitude as that which
we now produce, it would indeed prove a grave moral problem how this
could be done justly. This, however, is not the position in which we find
ourselves. For there is no known way, other than by the distribution of
products in a competitive market, to inform individuals in what
direction their several efforts must aim so as to contribute as much as
possible to the total product.
The main point of my argument is, then, that the conflict between, on
one hand, advocates of the spontaneous extended human order created
by a competitive market, and on the other hand those who demand a
deliberate arrangement of human interaction by central authority based
on collective command over available resources is due to a factual error
by the latter about how knowledge of these resources is and can be
generated and utilised. As a question of fact, this conflict must be
settled by scientific study. Such study shows that, by following the
spontaneously generated moral traditions underlying the competitive
market order (traditions which do not satisfy the canons or norms of
rationality embraced by most socialists), we generate and garner greater
knowledge and wealth than could ever be obtained or utilised in a
centrally-directed economy whose adherents claim to proceed strictly in
accordance with `reason'. Thus socialist aims and programmes are
factually impossible to achieve or execute; and they also happen, into
the bargain as it were, to be logically impossible.
This is why, contrary to what is often maintained, these matters are
not merely ones of differing interests or value judgements. Indeed, the
question of how men came to adopt certain values or norms, and what
effect these had on the evolution of their civilisation, is itself above all a
factual one, one that lies at the heart of the present book, and whose
answer is sketched in its first three chapters. The demands of socialism
are not moral conclusions derived from the traditions that formed the
extended order that made civilisation possible. Rather, they endeavour
to overthrow these traditions by a rationally designed moral system
whose appeal depends on the instinctual appeal of its promised
consequences. They assume that, since people had been able to generate
some system of rules coordinating their efforts, they must also be able to
design an even better and more gratifying system. But if humankind
owes its very existence to one particular rule-guided form of conduct of
proven effectiveness, it simply does not have the option of choosing
another merely for the sake of the apparent pleasantness of its
immediately visible effects. The dispute between the market order and
socialism is no less than a matter of survival. To follow socialist
morality would destroy much of present humankind and impoverish
much of the rest.
7

THE FATAL CONCEIT

WAS SOCIALISM A MISTAKE?

All of this raises an important point about which I wish to be explicit
from the outset. Although I attack the presumption of reason on the part
of socialists, my argument is in no way directed against reason properly
used. By `reason properly used' I mean reason that recognises its own
li mitations and, itself taught by reason, faces the implications of the
astonishing fact, revealed by economics and biology, that order
generated without design can far outstrip plans men consciously
contrive. How, after all, could I be attacking reason in a book arguing
that socialism is factually and even logically untenable? Nor do I
dispute that reason may, although with caution and in humility, and in
a piecemeal way, be directed to the examination, criticism and rejection
of traditional institutions and moral principles. This book, like some of
my earlier studies, is directed against the traditional norms of reason
that guide socialism: norms that I believe embody a naive and
uncritical theory of rationality, an obsolete and unscientific methodology that I have elsewhere called 'constructivist rationalism' (1973).
Thus I wish neither to deny reason the power to improve norms and
institutions nor even to insist that it is incapable of recasting the whole
of our moral system in the direction now commonly conceived as `social
justice'. We can do so, however, only by probing every part of a system
of morals. If such a morality pretends to be able to do something that it
cannot possibly do, e.g., to fulfill a knowledge-generating and
organisational function that is impossible under its own rules and
norms, then this impossibility itself provides a decisive rational criticism
of that moral system. It is important to confront these consequences, for
the notion that, in the last resort, the whole debate is a matter of value
judgements and not of facts has prevented professional students of the
market order from stressing forcibly enough that socialism cannot
possibly do what it promises.
Nor should my argument suggest that I do not share some values
widely held by socialists; but I do not believe, as I shall argue later, that
the widely held conception of `social justice' either describes a possible
state of affairs or is even meaningful. Neither do I believe, as some
proponents of hedonistic ethics recommend, that we can make moral
decisions simply by considering the greatest foreseeable gratification.
The starting point for my endeavour might well be David Hume's
insight that `the rules of morality ... are not conclusions of our reason'
( Treatise, 1739/1886:11:235). This insight will play a central role in this
volume since it frames the basic question it tries to answer - which is

question of how we came to acquire such an irreplaceable economic
order - especially in view of my claim that powerful instinctual and
rationalistic impulses rebel against the morals and institutions that
capitalism requires.
The answer to this question, sketched in the first three chapters, is
built upon the old insight, well known to economics, that our values and
institutions are determined not simply by preceding causes but as part
of a process of unconscious self-organisation of a structure or pattern.
This is true not only of economics, but in a wide area, and is well
known today in the biological sciences. This insight was only the first of
a growing family of theories that account for the formation of complex
structures in terms of processes transcending our capacity to observe all
the several circumstances operating in the determination of their
particular manifestations. When I began my work I felt that I was
nearly alone in working on the evolutionary formation of such highly
complex self-maintaining orders. Meanwhile, researches on this kind of
problem - under various names, such as autopoiesis, cybernetics,
homeostasis, spontaneous order, self-organisation, synergetics, systems
theory, and so on - have become so numerous that I have been able to
study closely no more than a few of them. This book thus becomes a
tributary of a growing stream apparently leading to the gradual
development of an evolutionary (but certainly not simply Neo-Darwinian) ethics parallel and supplementary to, yet quite
distinct from, the already well-advanced development of evolutionary
epistemology.
Though the book raises in this way some difficult scientific and
philosophical questions, its chief task remains to demonstrate that one
of the most influential political movements of our time, socialism, is
based on demonstrably false premises, and despite being inspired by
good intentions and led by some of the most intelligent representatives
of our time, endangers the standard of living and the life itself of a large
proportion of our existing population. This is argued in the fourth
through sixth chapters, wherein I examine and refute the socialist
challenge to the account of the development and maintenance of our
civilisation that I offer in the first three chapters. In the seventh
chapter, I turn to our language, to show how it has been debased under
socialist influence and how careful we must be to keep ourselves from
being seduced by it into socialist ways of thinking. In the eighth
chapter, I consider an objection that might be raised not only by
socialists, but by others as well: namely, that the population explosion
undercuts my argument. Finally, in the ninth chapter, I present briefly
a few remarks about the role of religion in the development of our moral
traditions.

how does our morality emerge, and what implications may its mode of coming into
being have for our economic and political life?

The contention that we are constrained to preserve capitalism
because of its superior capacity to utilise dispersed knowledge raises the
8

ONE

THE FATAL CONCEIT

Since evolutionary theory plays so essential a part in this volume, I
should note that one of the promising developments of recent years,
leading to a better understanding of the growth and function of
knowledge (Popper, 1934/1959), and of complex and spontaneous
orders (Hayek, 1964, 1973, 1976, 1979) of various kinds, has been the
development of an evolutionary epistemology (Campbell, 1977, 1987;
Radnitzky & Bartley, 1987), a theory of knowledge that understands
reason and its products as evolutionary developments. In this volume I
turn to a set of related problems that, although of great importance,
remain largely neglected.
That is, I suggest that we need not only an evolutionary epistemology
but also an evolutionary account of moral traditions, and one of a
character rather different than hitherto available. Of course the
traditional rules of human intercourse, after language, law, markets and
money, were the fields in which evolutionary thinking originated. Ethics
is the last fortress in which human pride must now bow in recognition
of its origins. Such an evolutionary theory of morality is indeed
emerging, and its essential insight is that our morals are neither
instinctual nor a creation of reason, but constitute a separate tradition ' between instinct and reason', as the title of the first chapter indicates - a
tradition of staggering importance in enabling us to adapt to problems
and circumstances far exceeding our rational capacities. Our moral
traditions, like many other aspects of our culture, developed concurrently with our reason, not as its product. Surprising and paradoxical as
it may seem to some to say this, these moral traditions outstrip the
capacities of reason.

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

Consuetudo est quasi altera natura.

Les lois de la conscience que nous disons naitre de la nature, naissant de

Zwei Seelen wohnen, ach, in meiner Brust,

J. W. von Goethe
Biological and Cultural Evolution

To early thinkers the existence of an order of human activities
transcending the vision of an ordering mind seemed impossible. Even
Aristotle, who comes fairly late, still believed that order among men
could extend only so far as the voice of a herald could reach ( Ethics, IX,
x), and that a state numbering a hundred thousand people was thus
i mpossible. Yet what Aristotle thought impossible had already happened by the time he wrote these words. Despite his achievements as a
scientist, Aristotle spoke from his instincts, and not from observation or
reflection, when he confined human order to the reach of the herald's
cry.
Such beliefs are understandable, for man's instincts, which were fully
developed long before Aristotle's time, were not made for the kinds of
surroundings, and for the numbers, in which he now lives. They were
adapted to life in the small roving bands or troops in which the human
race and its immediate ancestors evolved during the few million years
while the biological constitution of homo sapiens was being formed. These
genetically inherited instincts served to steer the cooperation of the
members of the troop, a cooperation that was, necessarily, a narrowly
circumscribed interaction of fellows known to and trusted by one
another. These primitive people were guided by concrete, commonly
perceived aims, and by a similar perception of the dangers and
opportunities - chiefly sources of food and shelter - of their
11

THE FATAL CONCEIT

environment. They not only could hear their herald; they usually knew
him personally.
Although longer experience may have lent some older members of
these bands some authority, it was mainly shared aims and perceptions
that coordinated the activities of their members. These modes of
coordination depended decisively on instincts of solidarity and altruism
- instincts applying to the members of one's own group but not to
others. The members of these small groups could thus exist only as
such: an isolated man would soon have been a dead man. The primitive
individualism described by Thomas Hobbes is hence a myth. The
savage is not solitary, and his instinct is collectivist. There was never a
` war of all against all'.
Indeed, if our present order did not already exist we too might hardly
believe any such thing could ever be possible, and dismiss any report
about it as a tale of the miraculous, about what could never come into
being. What are chiefly responsible for having generated this extraordinary order, and the existence of mankind in its present size and
structure, are the rules of human conduct that gradually evolved
(especially those dealing with several property, honesty, contract,
exchange, trade, competition, gain, and privacy). These rules are
handed on by tradition, teaching and imitation, rather than by instinct,
and largely consist of prohibitions ('shalt not's') that designate
adjustable domains for individual decisions. Mankind achieved civilisation by developing and learning to follow rules (first in territorial tribes
and then over broader reaches) that often forbade him to do what his
instincts demanded, and no longer depended on a common perception
of events. These rules, in effect constituting a new and different
morality, and to which I would indeed prefer to confine the term
` morality', suppress or restrain the `natural morality', i.e., those
i nstincts that welded together the small group and secured cooperation
within it at the cost of hindering or blocking its expansion.
I prefer to confine the term `morality' to those non-instinctive rules that
enabled mankind to expand into an extended order since the concept of
morals makes sense only by contrast to impulsive and unreflective conduct
on one hand, and to rational concern with specific results on the other.
Innate reflexes have no moral quality, and 'sociobiologists' who apply terms
like altruism to them (and who should, to be consistent, regard copulation as
the most altruistic) are plainly wrong. Only if we mean to say that we ought
to follow `altruistic' emotions does altruism become a moral concept.
Admittedly, this is hardly the only way to use these terms. Bernard
Mandeville scandalized his contemporaries by arguing that `the grand
principle that makes us social creatures, the solid basis, the life and support
12

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

of all trade and employment without exception' is evil (1715/1924), by which
he meant, precisely, that the rules of the extended order conflicted with
innate instincts that had bound the small group together.
Once we view morals not as innate instincts but as learnt traditions, their
relation to what we ordinarily call feelings, emotions or sentiments raises
various interesting questions. For instance, although learnt, morals do not
necessarily always operate as explicit rules, but may manifest themselves, as
do true instincts, as vague disinclinations to, or distastes for, certain kinds of
action. Often they tell us how to choose among, or to avoid, inborn
instinctual drives.
It may be asked how restraints on instinctual demands serve to
coordinate the activities of larger numbers. As an example, continued
obedience to the command to treat all men as neighbours would have
prevented the growth of an extended order. For those now living within
the extended order gain from not treating one another as neighbours,
and by applying, in their interactions, rules of the extended order - such
as those of several property and contract - instead of the rules of
solidarity and altruism. An order in which everyone treated his
neighbour as himself would be one where comparatively few could be
fruitful and multiply. If we were, say, to respond to all charitable
appeals that bombard us through the media, this would exact a heavy
cost in distracting us from what we are most competent to do, and likely
only make us the tools of particular interest groups or of peculiar views
of the relative importance of particular needs. It would not provide a
proper cure for misfortunes about which we are understandably
concerned. Similarly, instinctual aggressiveness towards outsiders must
be curbed if identical abstract rules are to apply to the relations of all
men, and thus to reach across boundaries - even the boundaries of
states.
Thus, forming superindividual patterns or systems of cooperation
required individuals to change their `natural' or `instinctual' responses
to others, something strongly resisted. That such conflicts with inborn
instincts, `private vices', as Bernard Mandeville described them, might
turn out to be `public benefits', and that men had to restrain some
` good' instincts in order to develop the extended order, are conclusions
that became the source of dissension later too. For example, Rousseau
took the side of the `natural' although his contemporary Hume clearly
saw that `so noble an affection [as generosity] instead of fitting men for
large societies, is almost as contrary to them, as the most narrow
selfishness' (1739/1886:11, 270).
Constraints on the practices of the small group, it must be
emphasised and repeated, are hated. For, as we shall see, the individual
13

THE FATAL CONCEIT

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

following them, even though he depend on them for life, does not and
usually cannot understand how they function or how they benefit him.
He knows so many objects that seem desirable but for which he is not
permitted to grasp, and he cannot see how other beneficial features of
his environment depend on the discipline to which he is forced to
submit - a discipline forbidding him to reach out for these same
appealing objects. Disliking these constraints so much, we hardly can be
said to have selected them; rather, these constraints selected us: they
enabled us to survive.

thousand particulars which will be learnt by nobody but him who has
an interest in knowing them' (Bailey, 1840:3). Information-gathering
institutions such as the market enable us to use such dispersed and
unsurveyable knowledge to form super-individual patterns. After
institutions and traditions based on such patterns evolved, it was no
longer necessary for people to strive for agreement on a unitary purpose
(as in the small band), for widely dispersed knowledge and skills could
now readily be brought into play for diverse ends.
This development is readily apparent in biology as well as in
economics. Even within biology in the strict sense `evolutionary change
in general tends towards a maximum economy in the use of resources'
and `evolution thus "blindly" follows the route of maximum resources
use' ( Howard, 1982:83). Further, a modern biologist has rightly
observed that `ethics is the study of the way to allocate resources'
( Hardin, 1980:3) - all of which points to the close interconnections
among evolution, biology, and ethics.

It is no accident that many abstract rules, such as those treating
individual responsibility and several property, are associated with
economics. Economics has from its origins been concerned with how an
extended order of human interaction comes into existence through a
process of variation, winnowing and sifting far surpassing our vision or
our capacity to design. Adam Smith was the first to perceive that we
have stumbled upon methods of ordering human economic cooperation
that exceed the limits of our knowledge and perception. His `invisible
hand' had perhaps better have been described as an invisible or
unsurveyable pattern. We are led - for example by the pricing system in
market exchange - to do things by circumstances of which we are
largely unaware and which produce results that we do not intend. In
our economic activities we do not know the needs which we satisfy nor
the sources of the things which we get. Almost all of us serve people
whom we do not know, and even of whose existence we are ignorant;
and we in turn constantly live on the services of other people of whom
we know nothing. All this is possible because we stand in a great
framework of institutions and traditions - economic, legal, and moral into which we fit ourselves by obeying certain rules of conduct that we
never made, and which we have never understood in the sense in which
we understand how the things that we manufacture function.
Modern economics explains how such an extended order can come
into being, and how it itself constitutes an information-gathering
process, able to call up, and to put to use, widely dispersed information
that no central planning agency, let alone any individual, could know as
a whole, possess or control. Man's knowledge, as Smith knew, is
dispersed. As he wrote, `What is the species of domestic industry his
capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the
greatest value, every individual, it is evident, in his local situation,
judges much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him'
(1776/1976:11, 487). Or as an acute economic thinker of the nineteenth
century put it, economic enterprise requires `minute knowledge of a
14

The concept of order is difficult - like its near equivalents `system',
`structure' and `pattern'. We need to distinguish two different but related
conceptions of order. As a verb or noun, `order' may be used to describe
either the results of a mental activity of arranging or classifying objects or
events in various aspects according to our sense perception, as the scientific
re-arrangement of the sensory world tells us to do (Hayek, 1 952), or as the
particular physical arrangements that objects or events either are supposed to
possess or which are attributed to them at a certain time. Regularity, derived
from the Latin regula for rule, and order are of course simply the temporal
and the spatial aspects of the same sort of relation between elements.
Bearing this distinction in mind, we may say that humans acquired the
ability to bring about factually ordered arrangements serving their needs
because they learned to order the sensory stimuli from their surroundings
according to several different principles, rearrangements superimposed over the
order or classification effected by their senses and instincts. Ordering in the
sense of classifying objects and events is a way of actively rearranging them
to produce desired results.
We learn to classify objects chiefly through language, with which we not
merely label known kinds of objects but specify what we are to regard as
objects or events of the same or different kinds. We also learn from custom,
morality and law about effects expected from different kinds of action. For
example, the values or prices formed by interaction in markets prove to be
further superimposed means of classifying kinds of actions according to the
significance they have for an order of which the individual is merely one
element in a whole which he never made.
15

THE FATAL CONCEIT

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

The extended order did not of course arise all at once; the process
lasted longer and produced a greater variety of forms than its eventual
development into a world-wide civilisation might suggest (taking
perhaps hundreds of thousands of years rather than five or six
thousand); and the market order is comparatively late. The various
structures, traditions, institutions and other components of this order
arose gradually as variations of habitual modes of conduct were
selected. Such new rules would spread not because men understood that
they were more effective, or could calculate that they would lead to
expansion, but simply because they enabled those groups practising
them to procreate more successfully and to include outsiders.

increasingly distinguished man from other animals, although the
propensity to instinctive mass action remains one of several beastly
haracteristics that man has retained (Trotter, 1916). Even man's
c
animal ancestors had already acquired certain `cultural' traditions
before they became, anatomically, modern man. Such cultural traditions have also helped to shape some animal societies, as among birds
and apes, and probably also among many other mammals (Bonner,
1980). Yet the decisive change from animal to man was due to such
culturally-determined restraints on innate responses.
Whilst learnt rules, which the individual came to obey habitually
and almost as unconsciously as inherited instincts, increasingly replaced
the latter, we cannot precisely distinguish between these two determinants of conduct because they interact in complicated ways. Practices
learnt as infants have become as much part of our personalities as what
governed us already when we began to learn. Even some structural
changes in the human body have occurred because they helped man to
take fuller advantage of opportunities provided by cultural developments. Neither is it important for our present purposes how much of the
abstract structure that we call mind is transmitted genetically and
embodied in the physical structure of our central nervous system, or
how far it serves only as a receptacle enabling us to absorb cultural
tradition. The results of genetic and cultural transmission may both be
called traditions. What is important is that the two often conflict in the
ways mentioned.
Not even the near universality of some cultural attributes proves that
they are genetically determined. There may exist just one way to satisfy
certain requirements for forming an extended order - just as the
development of wings is apparently the only way in which organisms
can become able to fly (the wings of insects, birds and bats have quite
different genetic origins). There may also be fundamentally only one
way to develop a phonetic language, so that the existence of certain
common attributes possessed by all languages also does not by itself
show that they must be due to innate qualities.

This evolution came about, then, through the spreading of new
practices by a process of transmission of acquired habits analogous to,
but also in important respects different from, biological evolution. I
shall consider some of these analogies and differences below, but we
might mention here that biological evolution would have been far too
slow to alter or replace man's innate responses in the course of the ten
or twenty thousand years during which civilisation has developed - not
to speak of being too slow to have influenced the far greater numbers
whose ancestors joined the process only a few hundred years ago. Yet so
far as we know, all currently civilised groups appear to possess a similar
capacity for acquiring civilisation by learning certain traditions. Thus it
hardly seems possible that civilisation and culture are genetically
determined and transmitted. They have to be learnt by all alike through
tradition.
The earliest clear statement of such matters known to me was made by
A. M. Carr-Saunders who wrote that `man and groups are naturally
selected on account of the customs they practice just as they are selected on
account of their mental and physical characters. Those groups practising the
most advantageous customs will have an advantage in the constant struggle
between adjacent groups over those that practise less advantageous customs'
(1922:223, 302). Carr-Saunders, however, stressed the capacity to restrict
rather than to increase population. For more recent studies see Alland
(1967); Farb (1968:13); Simpson, who described culture, as opposed to
biology, as `the more powerful means of adaptation' (in B. Campbell, 1 972);
Popper, who argued that `cultural evolution continues genetic evolution by
other means' (Popper and Eccles, 1977:48); and Durham (in Chagnon and
Irons, 1979:19), who emphasises the effect of particular customs and
attributes in enhancing human reproduction.
This gradual replacement of innate responses by learnt rules
16

Two Moralities in Cooperation and Conflict

Although cultural evolution, and the civilisation that it created, brought
differentiation, individualisation, increasing wealth, and great expansion to mankind, its gradual advent has been far from smooth. We have
not shed our heritage from the face-to-face troop, nor have these
instincts either `adjusted' fully to our relatively new extended order or
been rendered harmless by it.
Yet the lasting benefits of some instincts should not be overlooked,
17

THE FATAL CONCEIT

including the particular endowment that enabled some other instinctual
modes to be at least partly displaced. For example, by the time culture
began to displace some innate modes of behaviour, genetic evolution
had probably also already endowed human individuals with a great
variety of characteristics which were better adjusted to the many
different environmental niches into which men had penetrated than
those of any non-domesticated animal - and this was probably so even
before growing division of labour within groups provided new chances
of survival for special types. Among the most important of these innate
characteristics which helped to displace other instincts was a great
capacity for learning from one's fellows, especially by imitation. The
prolongation of infancy and adolescence, which contributed to this
capacity, was probably the last decisive step determined by biological
evolution.
Moreover, the structures of the extended order are made up not only
of individuals but also of many, often overlapping, sub-orders within
which old instinctual responses, such as solidarity and altruism,
continue to retain some importance by assisting voluntary collaboration, even though they are incapable, by themselves, of creating a basis
for the more extended order. Part of our present difficulty is that we
must constantly adjust our lives, our thoughts and our emotions, in
order to live simultaneously within different kinds of orders according to
different rules. If we were to apply the unmodified, uncurbed, rules of
the micro-cosmos (i.e., of the small band or troop, or of, say, our
families) to the macro-cosmos (our wider civilisation), as our instincts
and sentimental yearnings often make us wish to do, we would destroy it.
Yet if we were always to apply the rules of the extended order to our
more intimate groupings, we would crush them. So we must learn to live in
two sorts of world at once. To apply the name `society' to both, or even
to either, is hardly of any use, and can be most misleading (see chapter
seven).
Yet despite the advantages attending our limited ability to live
simultaneously within two orders of rules, and to distinguish between
them, it is anything but easy to do either. Indeed, our instincts often
threaten to topple the whole edifice. The topic of this book thus
resembles, in a way, that of Civilisation and Its Discontents (1930), except
that my conclusions differ greatly from Freud's. Indeed, the conflict
between what men instinctively like and the learnt rules of conduct that
enabled them to expand - a conflict fired by the discipline of `repressive
or inhibitory moral traditions', as D. T. Campbell calls it - is perhaps
the major theme of the history of civilisation. It seems that Columbus
recognised at once that the life of the `savages' whom he encountered
was more gratifying to innate human instincts. And as I shall argue
18

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

later, I believe that an atavistic longing after the life of the noble savage
is the main source of the collectivist tradition.
Natural Man Unsuited to the Extended Order

One can hardly expect people either to like an extended order that runs
counter to some of their strongest instincts, or readily to understand
that it brings them the material comforts they also want. The order is
even `unnatural' in the common meaning of not conforming to man's
biological endowment. Much of the good that man does in the extended
order is thus not due to his being naturally good; yet it is foolish to
deprecate civilisation as artificial for this reason. It is artificial only in
the sense in which most of our values, our language, our art and our
very reason are artificial: they are not genetically embedded in our
biological structures. In another sense, however, the extended order is
perfectly natural: in the sense that it has itself, like similar biological
phenomena, evolved naturally in the course of natural selection (see
Appendix A).
Nonetheless it is true that the greater part of our daily lives, and the
pursuit of most occupations, give little satisfaction to deep-seated
`altruistic' desires to do visible good. Rather, accepted practices often
require us to leave undone what our instincts impel us to do. It is not so
much, as is often suggested, emotion and reason that conflict, but innate
instincts and learnt rules. Yet, as we shall see, following these learnt
rules generally does have the effect of providing a greater benefit to the
community at large than most direct `altruistic' action that a particular
individual might take.
One revealing mark of how poorly the ordering principle of the
market is understood is the common notion that `cooperation is better
than competition'. Cooperation, like solidarity, presupposes a large
measure of agreement on ends as well as on methods employed in their
pursuit. It makes sense in a small group whose members share
particular habits, knowledge and beliefs about possibilities. It makes
hardly any sense when the problem is to adapt to unknown
circumstances; yet it is this adaptation to the unknown on which the
coordination of efforts in the extended order rests. Competition is a
procedure of discovery, a procedure involved in all evolution, that led
man unwittingly to respond to novel situations; and through further
competition, not through agreement, we gradually increase our
efficiency.
To operate beneficially, competition requires that those involved
observe rules rather than resort to physical force. Rules alone can unite
an extended order. (Common ends can do so only during a temporary
19

THE FATAL CONCEIT

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

emergency that creates a common danger for all. The `moral equivalent
of war' offered to evoke solidarity is but a relapse into cruder principles
of coordination.) Neither all ends pursued, nor all means used, are
known or need to be known to anybody, in order for them to be taken
account of within a spontaneous order. Such an order forms of itself.
That rules become increasingly better adjusted to generate order
happened not because men better understood their function, but
because those groups prospered who happened to change them in a way
that rendered them increasingly adaptive. This evolution was not linear,
but resulted from continued trial and error, constant `experimentation'
in arenas wherein different orders contended. Of course there was no
intention to experiment - yet the changes in rules thrown forth by
historical accident, analogous to genetic mutations, had something of
the same effect.
The evolution of rules was far from unhindered, since the powers
enforcing the rules generally resisted rather than assisted changes
conflicting with traditional views about what was right or just. In turn,
enforcement of newly learnt rules that had fought their way to
acceptance sometimes blocked the next step of evolution, or restricted a
further extension of the coordination of individual efforts. Coercive
authority has rarely initiated such extensions of coordination, though it
has from time to time spread a morality that had already gained
acceptance within a ruling group.
All this confirms that the feelings that press against the restraints of
civilisation are anachronistic, adapted to the size and conditions of
groups in the distant past. Moreover, if civilisation has resulted from
unwanted gradual changes in morality, then, reluctant as we may be to
accept this, no universally valid system of ethics can ever be known to
us.

superiority of market institutions, a historical and evolutionary survey
of the emergence of capitalism (such as that presented in chapters two
and three) helps to explain how such productive, albeit unpopular and
. unintended, traditions happened to emerge, and how deep is their
significance for those immersed in the extended order. First, however, I
want to remove from the path just outlined a major stumbling-block, in
the form of a widely shared misconception of the nature of our capacity
to adopt useful practices.
Mind Is Not a Guide but a Product of Cultural Evolution, and Is Based More on
Imitation than on Insight or Reason

It would however be wrong to conclude, strictly from such evolutionary
premises, that whatever rules have evolved are always or necessarily
conducive to the survival and increase of the populations following
them. We need to show, with the help of economic analysis (see chapter
five), how rules that emerge spontaneously tend to promote human
survival. Recognising that rules generally tend to be selected, via
competition, on the basis of their human survival-value certainly does
not protect those rules from critical scrutiny. This is so, if for no other
reason, because there has so often been coercive interference in the
process of cultural evolution.
Yet an understanding of cultural evolution will indeed tend to shift
the benefit of the doubt to established rules, and to place the burden of
proof on those wishing to reform them. While it cannot prove the

We have mentioned the capacity to learn by imitation as one of the
prime benefits conferred during our long instinctual development.
Indeed, perhaps the most important capacity with which the human
individual is genetically endowed, beyond innate responses, is his ability
to acquire skills by largely imitative learning. In view of this, it is
important to avoid, right from the start, a notion that stems from what I
call the `fatal conceit': the idea that the ability to acquire skills stems
from reason. For it is the other way around: our reason is as much the
result of an evolutionary selection process as is our morality. It stems
however from a somewhat separate development, so that one should
never suppose that our reason is in the higher critical position and that
only those moral rules are valid that reason endorses.
I shall examine these matters in subsequent chapters, but a foretaste
of my conclusions may be in place here. The title of the present chapter,
` Between Instinct and Reason', is meant literally. I want to call
attention to what does indeed lie between instinct and reason, and which
on that account is often overlooked just because it is assumed that there
is nothing between the two. That is, I am chiefly concerned with
cultural and moral evolution, evolution of the extended order, which is,
on the one hand (as we have just seen), beyond instinct and often
opposed to it, and which is, on the other hand (as we shall see later),
incapable of being created or designed by reason.
My views, some of which have been sketched earlier (1952/79, 1973,
1976, 1979), can be summarised simply. Learning how to behave is
more the source than the result of insight, reason, and understanding.
Man is not born wise, rational and good, but has to be taught to
become so. It is not our intellect that created our morals; rather, human
interactions governed by our morals make possible the growth of reason
and those capabilities associated with it. Man became intelligent
because there was tradition - that which lies between instinct and reason
- for him to learn. This tradition, in turn, originated not from a

20

21

THE FATAL CONCEIT

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

capacity rationally to interpret observed facts but from habits of
responding. It told man primarily what he ought or ought not to do
under certain conditions rather than what he must expect to happen.
Thus I confess that I always have to smile when books on evolution,
even ones written by great scientists, end, as they often do, with
exhortations which, while conceding that everything has hitherto
developed by a process of spontaneous order, call on human reason now that things have become so complex - to seize the reins and control
future development. Such wishful thinking is encouraged by what I
have elsewhere called the 'constructivist rationalism' (1973) that affects
much scientific thinking, and which was made quite explicit in the title
of a highly successful book by a well-known socialist anthropologist,
Man Makes Himself (V. Gordon Childe, 1936), a title that was adopted
by many socialists as a sort of watchword (Heilbroner, 1970:106). These
assumptions include the unscientific, even animistic, notion that at
some stage the rational human mind or soul entered the evolving
human body and became a new, active guide of further cultural
development (rather than, as actually happened, that this body
gradually acquired the capacity to absorb exceedingly complex
principles that enabled it to move more successfully in its own
environment). This notion that cultural evolution entirely postdates
biological or genetic evolution passes over the most important part of
the evolutionary process, that in which reason itself was formed. The
idea that reason, itself created in the course of evolution, should now be
in a position to determine its own future evolution (not to mention any
number of other things which it is also incapable of doing) is inherently
contradictory, and can readily be refuted (see chapters five and six). It
is less accurate to suppose that thinking man creates and controls his
cultural evolution than it is to say that culture, and evolution, created
his reason. In any case, the idea that at some point conscious design
stepped in and displaced evolution substitutes a virtually supernatural
postulate for scientific explanation. So far as scientific explanation is
concerned, it was not what we know as mind that developed civilisation,
let alone directed its evolution, but rather mind and civilisation which
developed or evolved concurrently. What we call mind is not something
that the individual is born with, as he is born with his brain, or
something that the brain produces, but something that his genetic
equipment (e.g., a brain of a certain size and structure) helps him to
acquire, as he grows up, from his family and adult fellows by absorbing
the results of a tradition that is not genetically transmitted. Mind in this
sense consists less of testable knowledge about the world, less in
interpretations of man's surroundings, more in the capacity to restrain
instincts - a capacity which cannot be tested by individual reason since

its effects are on the group. Shaped by the environment in which
individuals grow up, mind in turn conditions the preservation,
development, richness, and variety of traditions on which individuals
draw. By being transmitted largely through families, mind preserves a
multiplicity of concurrent streams into which each newcomer to the
community can delve. It may well be asked whether an individual who
did not have the opportunity to tap such a cultural tradition could be
said even to have a mind.
Just as instinct is older than custom and tradition, so then are the
latter older than reason: custom and tradition stand between instinct and
reason - logically, psychologically, temporally. They are due neither to
what is sometimes called the unconscious, nor to intuition, nor to
rational understanding. Though in a sense based on human experience
in that they were shaped in the course of cultural evolution, they were
not formed by drawing reasoned conclusions from certain facts or from
an awareness that things behaved in a particular way. Though
governed in our conduct by what we have learnt, we often do not know
why we do what we do. Learnt moral rules, customs, progressively
displaced innate responses, not because men recognised by reason that
they were better but because they made possible the growth of an
extended order exceeding anyone's vision, in which more effective
collaboration enabled its members, however blindly, to maintain more
people and to displace other groups.

The Mechanism of Cultural Evolution Is Not Darwinian

We are led by our argument to consider more closely the relationship
between the theory of evolution and the development of culture. It is an
issue that raises a number of interesting questions, to many of which
economics provides an access that few other disciplines offer.
There has however been great confusion about the matter, some of
which should be mentioned if only to warn the reader that we do not
intend to repeat it here. Social Darwinism, in particular, proceeded
from the assumption that any investigator into the evolution of human
culture has to go to school with Darwin. This is mistaken. I have the
greatest admiration for Charles Darwin as the first who succeeded in
elaborating a consistent (if still incomplete) theory of evolution in any
field. Yet his painstaking efforts to illustrate how the process of
evolution operated in living organisms convinced the scientific community of what had long been a commonplace in the humanities - at
least since Sir William Jones in 1787 recognised the striking
resemblance of Latin and Greek to Sanskrit, and the descent of all
' Indo-Germanic' languages from the latter. This example reminds us

THE FATAL CONCEIT

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

that the Darwinian or biological theory of evolution was neither the first
nor the only such theory, and actually is wholly distinct, and differs
somewhat from, other evolutionary accounts. The idea of biological
evolution stems from the study of processes of cultural development
which had been recognised earlier: processes that lead to the
formulation of institutions like language (as in the work of Jones), law,
morals, markets, and money.

well known, it is also almost always forgotten.
Of course the theory of cultural evolution (sometimes also described
as psycho-social, super-organic, or exosomatic evolution) and the theory
of biological evolution are, although analogous in some important ways,
hardly identical. Indeed, they often start from quite different assumptions. Cultural evolution is, as Julian Huxley justly stated, `a process
differing radically from biological evolution, with its own laws and
mechanisms and modalities, and not capable of explanation on purely
biological grounds' (Huxley, 1947). Just to mention several important
differences: although biological theory now excludes the inheritance of
acquired characteristics, all cultural development rests on such
inheritance - characteristics in the form of rules guiding the mutual
relations among individuals which are not innate but learnt. To refer to
terms now used in biological discussion, cultural evolution simulates
Lamarckism (Popper, 1972). Moreover, cultural evolution is brought
about through transmission of habits and information not merely from
the individual's physical parents, but from an indefinite number of
` ancestors'. The processes furthering the transmission and spreading of
cultural properties by learning also, as already noted, make cultural
evolution incomparably faster than biological evolution. Finally,
cultural evolution operates largely through group selection; whether
group selection also operates in biological evolution remains an open
question - one on which my argument does not depend (Edelman,
1987; Ghiselin, 1969:57-9, 132-3; Hardy, 1965:153ff, 206; Mayr,
1970:114; Medawar, 1983:134-5; Ruse, 1982:190-5, 203-6, 235-6).

Thus perhaps the chief error of contemporary `sociobiology' is to suppose
that language, morals, law, and such like, are transmitted by the `genetic'
processes that molecular biology is now illuminating, rather than being the
products of selective evolution transmitted by imitative learning. This idea is
as wrong - although at the other end of the spectrum - as the notion that
man consciously invented or designed institutions like morals, law, language
or money, and thus can improve them at will, a notion that is a remnant of
the superstition that evolutionary theory in biology had to combat: namely,
that wherever we find order there must have been a personal orderer. Here
again we find that an accurate account lies between i nstinct and reason.
Not only is the idea of evolution older in the humanities and social
sciences than in the natural sciences, I would even be prepared to argue
that Darwin got the basic ideas of evolution from economics. As we
learn from his notebooks, Darwin was reading Adam Smith just when,
in 1838, he was formulating his own theory (see Appendix A below).'
In any case, Darwin's work was preceded by decades, indeed by a
century, of research concerning the rise of highly complex spontaneous
orders through a process of evolution. Even words like `genetic' and
`genetics', which have today become technical expressions of biology,
were by no means invented by biologists. The first person I know to
have spoken of genetic development was the German philosopher and
cultural historian Herder. We find the idea again in Wieland, and again
in Humboldt. Thus modern biology has borrowed the concept of

Account of the Life and Writings of the Author ( London: Cadell and Davies, 1795, pp. xxvi-xxvii).
Of the latter, Darwin noted that he had read it and that it was `worth reading as giving
abstract of Smith's views'. In 1839 Darwin read Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments; or, An
Essay Towards an Analysis of the Principles by which Men Naturally judge concerning the Conduct and
Character, first of their Neighbours, and afterwards of themselves, to which is added, A Dissertation on the
Origin of Languages, 1 0th ed., 2 vols. (London: Cadell & Davies, 1804). There does not appear

to be any evidence that Darwin read The Wealth of Nations. - Ed.

It is wrong for Bonner (1980:10) to claim that culture is `as biological as any
other function of an organism, for instance respiration or locomotion'. To
label `biological' the formation of the tradition of language, morals, law,
money, even of the mind, abuses language and misunderstands theory. Our
genetic inheritance may determine what we are capable of learning but
certainly not what tradition is there to learn. What is there to learn is not
even the product of the human brain. What is not transmitted by genes is
not a biological phenomenon.
Despite such differences, all evolution, cultural as well as biological,
is a process of continuous adaptation to unforeseeable events, to
contingent circumstances which could not have been forecast. This is
another reason why evolutionary theory can never put us in the position
of rationally predicting and controlling future evolution. All it can do is
to show how complex structures carry within themselves a means of
correction that leads to further evolutionary developments which are,
however, in accordance with their very nature, themselves unavoidably
unpredictable.
25

THE FATAL CONCEIT

Having mentioned several differences between cultural and biological
evolution, I should stress that in one important respect they are at one:
neither biological nor cultural evolution knows anything like `laws of
evolution' or `inevitable laws of historical development' in the sense of
laws governing necessary stages or phases through which the products
of evolution must pass, and enabling the prediction of future
developments. Cultural evolution is determined neither genetically nor
otherwise, and its results are diversity, not uniformity. Those philosophers like Marx and Auguste Comte who have contended that our
studies can lead to laws of evolution enabling the prediction of
inevitable future developments are mistaken. In the past, evolutionary
approaches to ethics have been discredited chiefly because evolution
was wrongly connected with such alleged `laws of evolution', whereas in
fact the theory of evolution must emphatically repudiate such laws as
i mpossible. As I have argued elsewhere (1952), complex phenomena are
confined to what I call pattern prediction or predictions of the principle.
One of the main sources of this particular misunderstanding results
from confusing two wholly different processes which biologists distinguish as ontogenetic and phylogenetic. Ontogenesis has to do with the
predetermined development of individuals, something indeed set by
inherent mechanisms built into the genom of the germ cell. By contrast,
phylogeny - that with which evolution is concerned - deals with the
evolutionary history of the species or type. While biologists have
generally been protected against confusing these two by their training,
students of affairs unfamiliar with biology often fall victim to their
ignorance and are led to 'historicist' beliefs that imply that phylogenesis
operates in the same way as does ontogenesis. These historicist notions
were effectively refuted by Sir Karl Popper (1945, 1957).
Biological and cultural evolution share other features too. For
example, they both rely on the same principle of selection: survival or
reproductive advantage. Variation, adaptation and competition are
essentially the same kind of process, however different their particular
mechanisms, particularly those pertaining to propagation. Not only
does all evolution rest on competition; continuing competition is
necessary even to preserve existing achievements.

BETWEEN INSTINCT AND REASON

Although I wish the theory of evolution to be seen in its broad historical
setting, the differences between biological and cultural evolution to be
understood, and the contribution of the social sciences to our knowledge
of evolution to be recognized, I do not wish to dispute that the working
out of Darwin's theory of biological evolution, in all of its ramifications,
is one of the great intellectual achievements of modern times - one that
gives us a completely new view of our world. Its universality as a means

of explanation is also expressed in the new work of some distinguished
physical scientists, which shows that the idea of evolution is in no way
li mited to organisms, but rather that it begins in a sense already with
atoms, which have developed out of more elementary particles, and that
we can thus explain molecules, the most primitive complex organisms,
and even the complex modern world through various processes of
evolution (see Appendix A).
No one who takes an evolutionary approach to the study of culture
can, however, fail to be aware of the hostility often shown towards such
approaches. Such hostility often stems from reactions to just those
`social scientists' who in the nineteenth century needed Darwin to
recognise what they ought to have learnt from their own predecessors,
and who did a lasting disservice to the advance of the theory of cultural
evolution, which they indeed brought into discredit.
Social Darwinism is wrong in many respects, but the intense dislike of
it shown today is also partly due to its conflicting with the fatal conceit
that man is able to shape the world around him according to his wishes.
Although this too has nothing to do with evolutionary theory properly
understood, constructivist students of human affairs often use the
inappropriateness (and such plain mistakes) of Social Darwinism as a
pretext for rejecting any evolutionary approach at all.
Bertrand Russell provides a good example in his claim that `if
evolutionary ethics were sound, we ought to be entirely indifferent to
what the course of evolution might be, since whatever it is is thereby
proved to be best' (1910/1966:24). This objection, which A.G.N. Flew
(1967:48) regards as `decisive', rests on a simple misunderstanding. I
have no intention to commit what is often called the genetic or
naturalistic fallacy. I do not claim that the results of group selection of
traditions are necessarily `good' - any more than I claim that other
things that have long survived in the course of evolution, such as
cockroaches, have moral value.
I do claim that, whether we like it or not, without the particular
traditions I have mentioned, the extended order of civilisation could not
continue to exist (whereas, were cockroaches to disappear, the resulting
ecological `disaster' would perhaps not wreak permanent havoc on
mankind); and that if we discard these traditions, out of ill-considered
notions (which may indeed genuinely commit the naturalistic fallacy) of
what it is to be reasonable, we shall doom a large part of mankind to
poverty and death. Only when these facts are fully faced do we have
any business - or are we likely to have any competence - to consider
what the right and good thing to do may be.
While facts alone can never determine what is right, ill-considered
notions of what is reasonable, right and good may change the facts and

the circumstances in which we live; they may destroy, perhaps forever,
not only developed individuals and buildings and art and cities (which
we have long known to be vulnerable to the destructive powers of
moralities and ideologies of various sorts), but also traditions,
institutions, and interrelations without which such creations could
hardly have come into being or ever be recreated.

THE ORIGINS OF LIBERTY,
PROPERTY AND JUSTICE

Nobody is at liberty to attack several property and to say that he values
civilisation. The history of the two cannot be disentangled.
Henry Sumner Maine
Property ... is therefore inseparable from human economy in its social
form.
Carl Menger
Men are qualified for civil liberties, in exact proportion to their
disposition to put moral chains upon their appetites: in proportion as
their love of justice is above their rapacity.
Edmund Burke
Freedom and the Extended Order

If morals and tradition, rather than intelligence and calculating reason,
lifted men above the savages, the distinctive foundations of modern
civilisation were laid in antiquity in the region surrounding the
Mediterranean Sea. There, possibilities of long-distance trade gave, to
those communities whose individuals were allowed to make free use of
their individual knowledge, an advantage over those in which common
local knowledge or that of a ruler determined the activities of all. So far
as we know, the Mediterranean region was the first to see the
acceptance of a person's right to dispose over a recognised private
domain, thus allowing individuals to develop a dense network of
commercial relations among different communities. Such a network
worked independently of the views and desires of local chiefs, for the
movements of naval traders could hardly be centrally directed in those
days. If we may accept the account of a highly respected authority (and
one certainly not biased in favour of the market order), `the
Graeco-Roman world was essentially and precisely one of private
ownership, whether of a few acres or of the enormous domains of
Roman senators and emperors, a world of private trade and
manufacture' (Finley, 1973:29).
Such an order serving a multiplicity of private purposes could in fact
28

29

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE ORIGINS OF LIBERTY, PROPERTY AND JUSTICE

have been formed only on the basis of what I prefer to call several
which is H. S. Maine's more precise term for what is usually
described as private property. If several property is the heart of the
morals of any advanced civilisation, the ancient Greeks seem to have
been the first to see that it is also inseparable from individual freedom.
The makers of the constitution of ancient Crete are reported to have
` taken it for granted that liberty is a state's highest good and for this
reason alone make property belong specifically to those who acquire it,
whereas in ' a condition of slavery everything belongs to the rulers'
(Strabo, 10, 4, 16).
An important aspect of this freedom - the freedom on the part of
different individuals or sub-groups to pursue distinct aims, guided by
their differing knowledge and skills - was made possible not only by the
separate control of various means of production, but also by another
practice, virtually inseparable from the first: the recognition of approved
methods of transferring this control. The individual's ability to decide
for himself how to use specific things, being guided by his own
knowledge and expectations as well as by those of whatever group he
might join, depends on general recognition of a respected private
domain of which the individual is free to dispose, and an equally
recognised way in which the right to particular things can be
transferred from one person to another. The prerequisite for the
existence of such property, freedom, and order, from the time of the
Greeks to the present, is the same: law in the sense of abstract rules
enabling any individual to ascertain at any time who is entitled to
dispose over any particular thing.
With respect to some objects, the notion of individual property must
have appeared very early, and the first hand-crafted tools are perhaps
an appropriate example. The attachment of a unique and highly useful
tool or weapon to its maker might, however, be so strong that transfer
became so psychologically difficult that the instrument must accompany
him even into the grave - as in the tholos or beehive tombs of the
Mycenaean period. Here the fusion of inventor with `rightful owner'
appears, and with it numerous elaborations of the basic idea, sometimes
accompanied also by legend, as in the later story of Arthur and his
sword Excalibur - a story in which the transfer of the sword came about
not by human law but by a `higher' law of magic or `the powers'.
The extension and refinement of the concept of property were, as
such examples suggest, necessarily gradual processes that are hardly
completed even today. Such a concept cannot yet have been of much
significance in the roving bands of hunters and gatherers among whom
the discoverer of a source of food or place of shelter was obliged to
reveal his find to his fellows. The first individually crafted durable tools

probably became attached to their makers because they were the only
ones who had the skill to use them - and here again the story of Arthur
and Excalibur is appropriate, for while Arthur did not make Excalibur,
he was the only one able to use it. Separate ownership of perishable
goods, on the other hand, may have appeared only later as the
solidarity of the group weakened and individuals became responsible for
more limited groups such as the family. Probably the need to keep a
workable holding intact gradually led from group ownership to
individual property in land.
There is however little use in speculating about the particular
sequence of these developments, for they probably varied considerably
among the peoples who progressed through nomadic herding and those
who developed agriculture. The crucial point is that the prior
development of several property is indispensable for the development of
trading, and thereby for the formation of larger coherent and
cooperating structures, and for the appearance of those signals we call
prices. Whether individuals, or extended families, or voluntary
groupings of individuals were recognised as owning particular objects is
less important than that all were permitted to choose which individuals
would determine what use was to be made of their property. There will
also have developed, especially with regard to land, such arrangements
as `vertical' division of property rights between superior and inferior
owners, or ultimate owners and lessees, such as are used in modern
estate developments, of which more use could perhaps be made today
than some more primitive conceptions of property allow.
Nor should tribes be thought of as the stock from which cultural
evolution began; they are, rather, its earliest product. These `earliest'
coherent groups were of common descent and community of practice
with other groups and individuals with whom they were not necessarily
familiar (as will be discussed in the next chapter). Hence we can hardly
say when tribes first appeared as preservers of shared traditions, and
cultural evolution began. Yet somehow, however slowly, however
marked by setbacks, orderly cooperation was extended, and common
concrete ends were replaced by general, end-independent abstract rules
of conduct.

property,

The Classical Heritage of European Civilisation

It appears also to have been the Greeks, and especially the Stoic
philosophers, with their cosmopolitan outlook, who first formulated the
moral tradition which the Romans later propagated throughout their
Empire. That this tradition arouses great resistance we already know
and will witness again repeatedly. In Greece it was of course chiefly the

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE ORIGINS OF LIBERTY, PROPERTY AND JUSTICE

Spartans, the people who resisted the commercial revolution most
strongly, who did not recognise individual property but allowed and
even encouraged theft. To our time they have remained the prototype of
savages who rejected civilisation (for representative 18th-century views
on them compare Dr. Samuel Johnson in Boswell's Life or Friedrich
Schiller's essay Uber die Gesetzgebung des Lykurgos and Solon). Yet already
in Plato and Aristotle, however, we find a nostalgic longing for return to
Spartan practice, and this longing persists to the present. It is a craving
for a micro-order determined by the overview of omniscient authority.
It is true that, for a time, the large trading communities that had
grown up in the Mediterranean were precariously protected against
marauders by the still more martial Romans who, as Cicero tells us,
could dominate the region by subduing the most advanced commercial
centres of Corinth and Carthage, which had sacrificed military prowess
to mercandi et navigandi cupiditas (De re publica, 2, 7-10). But during the
last years of the Republic and the first centuries of the Empire,
governed by a senate whose members were deeply involved in
commercial interests, Rome gave the world the prototype of private law
based on the most absolute conception of several property. The decline
and final collapse of this first extended order came only after central
administration in Rome increasingly displaced free endeavour. This
sequence has been repeated again and again: civilisation might spread,
but is not likely to advance much further, under a government that
takes over the direction of daily affairs from its citizens. It would seem
that no advanced civilisation has yet developed without a government
which saw its chief aim in the protection of private property, but that
again and again the further evolution and growth to which this gave rise
was halted by a `strong' government. Governments strong enough to
protect individuals against the violence of their fellows make possible
the evolution of an increasingly complex order of spontaneous and
voluntary cooperation. Sooner or later, however, they tend to abuse that
power and to suppress the freedom they had earlier secured in order to
enforce their own presumedly greater wisdom and not to allow `social
institutions to develop in a haphazard manner' (to take a characteristic
expression that is found under the heading `social engineering' in the

during recurrent `times of trouble' when government control was
temporarily weakened. But these rebellions or aberrances were
regularly smothered by the might of a state preoccupied with the literal
preservation of traditional order (J. Needham, 1954).

Fontana/Harper Dictionary of Modern Thought (1977)).

This is also well illustrated in Egypt, where we have quite good information
about the role that private property played in the initial rise of this great
civilisation. In his study of Egyptian institutions and private law, Jacques
Pirenne describes the essentially individualistic character of the law at the
end of the third dynasty, when property was `individual and inviolable,
depending wholly on the proprietor' (Pirenne, 1934:I1, 338-9), but records
the beginning of its decay already during the fifth dynasty. This led to
the state socialism of the eighteenth dynasty described in another French
work of the same date (Dairaines, 1934), which prevailed for the next two
thousand years and largely explains the stagnant character of Egyptian
civilisation during that period.
Similarly, of the revival of European civilisation during the later
Middle Ages it could be said that the expansion of capitalism - and
European civilisation - owes its origins and raison d'etre to political
anarchy (Baechler, 1975:77). It was not under the more powerful
governments, but in the towns of the Italian Renaissance, of South
Germany and of the Low Countries, and finally in lightly-governed
England, i.e., under the rule of the bourgeoisie rather than of warriors,
that modern industrialism grew. Protection of several property, not the
direction of its use by government, laid the foundations for the growth
of the dense network of exchange of services that shaped the extended
order.
Nothing is more misleading, then, than the conventional formulae of
historians who represent the achievement of a powerful state as the
culmination of cultural evolution: it as often marked its end. In this
respect students of early history were overly impressed and greatly
misled by monuments and documents left by the holders of political
power, whereas the true builders of the extended order, who as often as
not created the wealth that made the monuments possible, left less
tangible and ostentatious testimonies to their achievement.

If the Roman decline did not permanently terminate the processes of
evolution even in Europe, similar beginnings in Asia (and later
independently in Meso-America) were stopped by powerful governments which (similar to but exceeding in power mediaeval feudal
systems in Europe) also effectively suppressed private initiative. In the
most remarkable of these, imperial China, great advances towards
civilisation and towards sophisticated industrial technology took place

Nor did wise observers of the emerging extended order much doubt that
it was rooted in the security, guaranteed by governments, that limited
coercion to the enforcement of abstract rules determining what was to
belong to whom. The `possessive individualism' of John Locke was, for

32

33

` Where There Is No Property There Is No justice'

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE ORIGINS OF LIBERTY, PROPERTY AND JUSTICE

example, not just a political theory but the product of an analysis of the
conditions to which England and Holland owed their prosperity. It was
based in the insight that the justice that political authority must enforce,
if it wants to secure the peaceful cooperation among individuals on
which prosperity rests, cannot exist without the recognition of private
property: ' "Where there is no property there is no justice," is a
proposition as certain as any demonstration in Euclid: for the idea of
property being a right to anything, and the idea to which the name of
injustice is given being the invasion or violation of that right; it is
evident that these ideas being thus established, and these names
annexed to them, I can as certainly know this proposition to be true as
that a triangle has three angles equal to two right ones' (John Locke:
1690/1924:IV, iii, 18). Soon afterwards, Montesquieu made known his
message that it had been commerce that spread civilisation and sweet
manners among the barbarians of Northern Europe.
For David Hume and other Scottish moralists and theorists of the
eighteenth century, it was evident that the adoption of several property
marks the beginning of civilisation; rules regulating property seemed so
central to all morals that Hume devoted most of his Treatise on morals
to them. It was to restrictions on government power to interfere with
property that he later, in his History of England (Vol. V), ascribed that
country's greatness; and in the Treatise itself (III, ii) he clearly
explained that if mankind were to execute a law which, rather than
establishing general rules governing ownership and exchange of
property, instead `assigned the largest possession to the most extensive
virtue, . . . so great is the uncertainty of merit, both from the natural
obscurity, and from the self-conceit of every individual, that no
determinate rule of conduct would ever follow from it, and the total
dissolution of society must be the immediate consequence'. Later, in the
Enquiry, he remarked: `Fanatics may suppose, that domination is founded on
grace, and that saints alone inherit the earth; but the civil magistrate very
justly puts these sublime theorists on the same footing with the common
robbers, and teaches them by severe discipline, that a rule, which, in
speculation, may seem the most advantageous to society, may yet be
found, in practice, totally pernicious and destructive' (1777/1886:IV,
187).
Hume noticed clearly the connection of these doctrines to freedom,
and how the maximum freedom of all requires equal restraints on the
freedom of each through what he called the three `fundamental laws of
nature': `the stability of possession, of its transference by consent, and of
the performance of promises' (1739/1886:11, 288, 293). Though his
views evidently derived in part from those of theorists of the common
law, such as Sir Matthew Hale (1609-76), Hume may have been the

first clearly to perceive that general freedom becomes possible by the
natural moral instincts being `checked and restrained by a subsequent
judgement' according to 'justice, or a regard to the property of others,
fidelity, or the observance of promises [which have] become obligatory,
and acquire[d] an authority over mankind' (1741, 1742/1886:111, 455).
Hume did not make the error, later so common, of confusing two senses
of freedom: that curious sense in which an isolated individual is
supposed to be able to be free, and that in which many persons
collaborating with one another can be free. Seen in the latter context of
such collaboration, only abstract rules of property - i.e., the rules of law
- guarantee freedom.
When Adam Ferguson summed up such teaching by defining the
savage as a man who did not yet know property (1767/73:136), and
when Adam Smith remarked that `nobody ever saw one animal by its
gestures or natural cries signify to another, this is mine, that is yours'
(1776/1976:26), they expressed what, in spite of recurrent revolts by
rapacious or hungry bands, had for practically two millennia been the
view of the educated. As Ferguson put it, `It must appear very evident,
that property is a matter of progress' (ibid.). Such matters were, as we
have noticed, also then investigated in language and the law; they were
well understood in the classical liberalism of the nineteenth century;
and it was probably through Edmund Burke, but perhaps even more
through the influence of German linguists and lawyers like F. C. von
Savigny, that these themes were then taken up again by H. S. Maine.
Savigny's statement (in his protest against the codification of the civil
law) deserves to be reproduced at length: `If in such contacts free agents
are to exist side by side, mutually supporting and not impeding each
other in their development, this can be achieved only by recognising an
invisible boundary within which the existence and operation of each
individual is assured a certain free space. The rules by which these
boundaries and through it the free range of each is determined is the
law' (Savigny, 1840:1, 331-2).

The Various Forms and Objects of Property and the Improvement Thereof

The institutions of property, as they exist at present, are hardly perfect;
indeed, we can hardly yet say in what such perfection might consist.
Cultural and moral evolution do require further steps if the institution
of several property is in fact to be as beneficial as it can be. For
example, we need the general practice of competition to prevent abuse
of property. This in turn requires further restraint on the innate feelings
of the micro-order, the small group discussed earlier (see chapter one
above, and Schoeck, 1966/69), for these instinctual feelings are often

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE ORIGINS OF LIBERTY, PROPERTY AND JUSTICE

threatened not only by several property but sometimes even more so by
competition, and this leads people to long doubly for non-competitive
`solidarity'.
While property is initially a product of custom, and jurisdiction and
legislation have merely developed it in the course of millennia, there is
then no reason to suppose that the particular forms it has assumed in
the contemporary world are final. Traditional concepts of property
rights have in recent times been recognised as a modifiable and very
complex bundle whose most effective combinations have not yet been
discovered in all areas. New investigations of these matters, originating
largely in the stimulating but unfortunately uncompleted work of the
late Sir Arnold Plant, have been taken up in a few brief but most
influential essays by his former student Ronald Coase (1937 and 1960)
which have stimulated the growth of an extensive `property rights
school' (Alchian, Becker, Cheung, Demsetz, Pejovich). The results of
these investigations, which we cannot attempt to summarise here, have
opened new possibilities for future improvements in the legal framework
of the market order.
Just to illustrate how great our ignorance of the optimum forms of
delimitation of various rights remains - despite our confidence in the
i ndispensability of the general institution of several property - a few
remarks about one particular form of property may be made.
The slow selection by trial and error of a system of rules delimiting
individual ranges of control over different resources has created a
curious position. Those very intellectuals who are generally inclined to
question those forms of material property which are indispensable for
the efficient organisation of the material means of production have become
the most enthusiastic supporters of certain immaterial property rights
invented only relatively recently, having to do, for example, with literary
productions and technological inventions (i.e., copyrights and patents).
The difference between these and other kinds of property rights is
this: while ownership of material goods guides the use of scarce means
to their most important uses, in the case of immaterial goods such as
literary productions and technological inventions the ability to produce
them is also limited, yet once they have come into existence, they can be
i ndefinitely multiplied and can be made scarce only by law in order to
create an inducement to produce such ideas. Yet it is not obvious that
such forced scarcity is the most effective way to stimulate the human
creative process. I doubt whether there exists a single great work of
literature which we would not possess had the author been unable to
obtain an exclusive copyright for it; it seems to me that the case for
copyright must rest almost entirely on the circumstance that such
exceedingly useful works as encyclopaedias, dictionaries, textbooks and

other works of reference could not be produced if, once they existed,
they could freely be reproduced.
Similarly, recurrent re-examinations of the problem have not demonstrated that the obtainability of patents of invention actually enhances
the flow of new technical knowledge rather than leading to wasteful
concentration of research on problems whose solution in the near future
can be foreseen and where, in consequence of the law, anyone who hits
upon a solution a moment before the next gains the right to its exclusive
use for a prolonged period (Machlup, 1962).

36

37

Organisations as Elements of Spontaneous Orders

Having written of the pretence of reason and the dangers of `rational'
interference with spontaneous order, I need to add yet another word of
caution. My central aim has made it necessary to stress the spontaneous
evolution of rules of conduct that assist the formation of self-organising
structures. This emphasis on the spontaneous nature of the extended or
macro-order could mislead if it conveyed the impression that, in the
macro-order, deliberate organisation is never important.
The elements of the spontaneous macro-order are the several
economic arrangements of individuals as well as those of deliberate
organisations. Indeed, the evolution of individualist law consists in
great measure in making possible the existence of voluntary associations
without compulsory powers. But as the overall spontaneous order
expands, so the sizes of the units of which it consists grow. Increasingly,
its elements will not be economies of individuals, but of such
organisations as firms and associations, as well as of administrative
bodies. Among the rules of conduct that make it possible for extensive
spontaneous orders to be formed, some will also facilitate deliberate
organisations suited to operate within the larger systems. However,
many of these various types of more comprehensive deliberate
organisation actually have a place only within an even more
comprehensive spontaneous order, and would be inappropriate within
an overall order that was itself deliberately organised.
Another, related, matter could also mislead. Earlier we mentioned the
growing differentiation of various kinds of property rights in a vertical
or hierarchical dimension. If, elsewhere in this book, we occasionally
speak about the rules of several property as if the contents of individual
property were uniform and constant, this should be seen as a
simplification that could mislead if understood without the qualifications already stated. This is in fact a field in which the greatest
advances in the governmental framework of the spontaneous order may
be expected, but which we cannot consider further here.

EVOLUTION OF THE MARKET: TRADE AND CIVILISATION

THREE

Having reviewed some of the circumstances in which the extended order
arose, and how this order both engenders and requires several property,
liberty and justice, we may now trace some further connections by
looking more closely at some other matters already alluded to - in
particular, the development of trade, and the specialisation that is
linked to it. These developments, which also contributed greatly to the
growth of an extended order, were little understood at the time, or
indeed for centuries afterwards, even by the greatest scientists and
philosophers; certainly no one ever deliberately arranged them.
The times, circumstances, and processes of which we write are
cloaked in the mists of time, and details cannot be discerned with any
confidence of accuracy. Some specialisation and exchange may already
have developed in early small communities guided entirely by the
consent of their members. Some nominal trade may have taken place as
primitive men, following the migration of animals, encountered other
men and groups of men. While archaeological evidence for very early
trade is convincing it is not only rare but also tends to be misleading.
The essentials that trade served to procure were mostly consumed
without leaving a trace - whereas rarities brought to tempt their owners
to part with these necessities were often meant to be kept and therefore
more durable. Ornaments, weapons, and tools provide our chief positive
evidence, while we can only infer from the absence in the locality of
essential natural resources used in their manufacture that these must
have been acquired by trade. Nor is archaeology likely to find the salt

that people obtained over long distances; but the remuneration that the
producers of salt received for selling it sometimes does remain. Yet it
was not the desire for luxury but necessity that made trade an
indispensable institution to which ancient communities increasingly
owed their very existence.
However these things may be, trade certainly came very early, and
trade over great distances, and in articles whose source is unlikely to
have been known to those traders engaged in it, is far older than any
other contact among remote groups that can now be traced. Modern
archaeology confirms that trade is older than agriculture or any other
sort of regular production (Leakey, 1981:212). In Europe there is
evidence of trade over very great distances even in the Palaeolithic age,
at least 30,000 years ago (Herskovits, 1948, 1960). Eight thousand years
ago, Catal Huyuk in Anatolia and Jericho in Palestine had become
centres of trade between the Black and the Red Seas, even before trade
in pottery and metals had begun. Both also provide early instances of
those `dramatic increases of population' often described as cultural
revolutions. Later, `a network of shipping and land routes existed by the
late seventh millennium B.C. for carrying obsidian from the island of
Melos to the mainland' of Asia Minor and Greece (see S. Green's
introduction to Childe, 1936/1981; and Renfrew, 1973:29, cf. also
Renfrew, 1972:297-307). There is `evidence for extensive trade networks
linking Baluchistan (in West Pakistan) with regions in western Asia
even before 3200 B.C.' (Childe, 1936/1981:19). We also know that the
economy of predynastic Egypt was firmly based on trade (Pirenne,
1934).
The importance of regular trade in Homeric times is indicated by the
story in the Odyssey (I, 180-184) in which Athena appears to
Telemachos in the guise of the master of a ship carrying a cargo of iron
to be exchanged for copper. The great expansion of trade which made
possible the later rapid growth of classical civilisation appears from
archaeological evidence also to have occurred at a time for which almost
no historical documentation is available, that is, during the two
hundred years from about 750 to 550 B.C. The expansion of trade also
seems to have brought about, at roughly the same time, rapid increases
of population in Greek and Phoenician centres of trade. These centres
so rivalled each other in establishing colonies that by the beginning of
the classical era life at the great centres of culture had become wholly
dependent on a regular market process.
The existence of trade in these early times is incontestable, as is its
role in spreading order. Yet the establishment of such a market process
could hardly have been easy, and must have been accompanied by a
substantial disruption of the early tribes. Even where some recognition

of several property had emerged, further and previously unheard of
practices would have been required before communities would be
inclined to permit members to carry away for use by strangers (and for
purposes only partly understood even by the traders themselves, let
alone the local populace) desirable items held within the community
that might otherwise have been available for local common use. For
example, the shippers of the rising Greek cities who took pottery jugs
filled with oil or wine to the Black Sea, Egypt or Sicily to exchange
them for grain, in the process took away, to people of whom their
neighbours knew virtually nothing, goods which those neighbours
themselves much desired. By allowing this to happen, members of the
small group must have lost their very bearings and begun to reorient to
a new comprehension of the world, one in which the importance of the
small group itself was much reduced. As Piggott explains in Ancient
Europe, ` Prospectors and miners, traders and middlemen, the organisation of shipments and caravans, concessions and treaties, the concept
of alien peoples and customs in distant lands - all these are involved in
the enlargement of social comprehension demanded by the technological step of entering ... a bronze age' (Piggott, 1965:72). As the
same author writes about the middle bronze age of the second
millennium, `The network of routes by sea, river and land gives an
i nternational character to much of the bronze-working of that time, and
we find techniques and styles widely distributed from one end of Europe
to the other' (ibid., 118).
What practices eased these new departures and ushered in not only a
new comprehension of the world but even a kind of `internationalisation'
(the word is of course anachronistic) of style, technique, and attitudes?
They must at least have included hospitality, protection, and safe
passage (see next section). The vaguely defined territories of primitive
tribes were presumably, even at an early date, interlaced by trading
connections among individuals based on such practices. Such personal
connections would provide successive links in chains over which small
yet indispensable amounts of `trace elements', as it were, were
transmitted over great distances. This made sedentary occupations, and
thus specialisation, possible in many new localities - and likewise
eventually increased the density of population. A chain reaction began:
the greater density of population, leading to the discovery of
opportunities for specialisation, or division of labour, led to yet further
increases of population and per capita income that made possible
another increase in the population. And so on.

40

EVOLUTION OF THE MARKET: TRADE AND CIVILISATION
The Density of Occupation of the World Made Possible by Trade

This `chain reaction' sparked by new settlement and trade may be
studied more closely. While some animals are adapted to particular and
rather limited environmental `niches' outside of which they can hardly
exist, men and a few other animals such as rats have been able to adapt
themselves almost everywhere on the surface of the earth. This is hardly
due merely to adaptations by individuals. Only a few and relatively small
localities would have provided small bands of hunters and gatherers all
that even the most primitive tool-using groups need for a settled
existence, and still less all they needed to till the earth. Without support
from fellows elsewhere, most humans would find the places they wish to
occupy either uninhabitable or able to be settled only very thinly.
Those few relatively self-sustaining niches that did exist would likely
be the first in any particular area to be permanently occupied and
defended against intruders. Yet people living there would come to know
of neighbouring places that provided most but not all their needs, and
which would lack some substance they would require only occasionally:
flint, strings for their bows, glues to fix cutting blades into handles,
tanning materials for hides, and such like. Confident that such needs
could be met by infrequent return visits to their present homes, they
would stride out from their groups, and occupy some of these
neighbouring places, or other new territory even further away in other
parts of the thinly populated continents on which they lived. The
i mportance of these early movements of persons and of necessary
goods cannot be gauged by volume alone. Without the availability of
i mports, even if they formed only an insignificant fraction of what was
currently being consumed in any particular place, it would have been
i mpossible for early settlers to maintain themselves, let alone to
multiply.
Return visits to replenish supplies would raise no difficulties so long
as the migrants were still known to those who had remained at home.
Within a few generations, however, descendants of these original groups
would begin to seem strangers to one another; and those inhabiting the
original more self-sustaining localities would often begin to defend
themselves and their supplies in various ways. To gain permission to
enter the original territory for the purpose of obtaining whatever special
substances could be obtained only there, visitors would, to herald their
peaceful intentions and to tempt the desires of its occupants, have had
to bring presents. To be most effective, these gifts had best not satisfy
everyday needs readily met locally, but would need to be enticingly new
and unusual ornaments or delicacies. This is one reason why objects
offered on one side of such transactions were, in fact, so often `luxuries'
41

THE FATAL CONCEIT

EVOLUTION OF THE MARKET: TRADE AND CIVILISATION

which hardly means that the objects exchanged were not necessities
for the other side.
Initially, regular connections involving exchange of presents would
probably have developed between families with mutual obligations of
hospitality connected in complex ways with the rituals of exogamy. The
transition from the practice of giving presents to such family members
and relations, to the appearance of more impersonal institutions of hosts
or `brokers' who routinely sponsored such visitors and gained for them
permission to stay long enough to obtain what they needed, and on to
the practice of exchanging particular things at rates determined by their
relative scarcity, was no doubt slow. But from the recognition of a
minimum still regarded as appropriate, and of a maximum at which the
transaction seemed no longer worthwhile, specific prices for particular
objects will gradually have emerged. Also inevitably, traditional
equivalents will steadily have adapted to changed conditions.
In any case, in early Greek history we do find the important
institution of the xenos, the guest-friend, who assured individual
admission and protection within an alien territory. Indeed, trade must
have developed very much as a matter of personal relations, even if the
warrior aristocracy disguised it as being no more than mutual exchange
of gifts. And it was not only those who were already wealthy who could
afford hospitality to members of particular families in other regions:
such relations also would have made people rich by providing channels
through which important needs of their community could be satisfied.
The xenos at Pylos and Sparta to whom Telemachos goes to get news of
his `much travelled father Odysseus' ( Odyssey: III) was probably such a
trading partner who by his wealth had risen to become king.
Such enlarged opportunities to deal advantageously with outsiders no
doubt also helped to reinforce the break that had by then already
occurred away from the solidarity, common aims, and collectivism of
the original small groups. In any case, some individuals did tear away,
or were released, from the hold and obligations of the small community,
and began not only to settle other communities, but also to lay the
foundations for a network of connections with members of still other
communities - a network that ultimately, in countless relays and
ramifications, has covered the whole earth. Such individuals were
enabled to contribute their shares, albeit unknowingly and unintentionally, towards the building of a more complex and extensive order - an
order far beyond their own or their contemporaries' purview.
To create such an order, such individuals had to be able to use
information for purposes known only to themselves. They could not
have done so without the benefit of certain practices, such as that of the
xenos, shared in common with distant groups. The practices would have

to be common; but the particular knowledge and ends of those
individuals following such practices could differ, and could be based on
privileged information. This, in turn, would have spurred individual
initiative.
For only an individual, not his group, could gain peaceful admission
to an alien territory, and thereby acquire knowledge not possessed by
his fellows. Trade could not be based on collective knowledge, only on
distinctive individual knowledge. Only the growing recognition of
several property could have made such use of individual initiative
possible. The shippers and other traders were guided by personal gain;
yet soon the wealth and livelihood of the growing population of their
home towns, which they made possible through the pursuit of gain
through trade rather than production, could be maintained only by
their continuing initiative in discovering ever new opportunities.

-

Lest what we have just written mislead, it must be remembered that why
men should ever have adopted any particular new custom or innovation is of
secondary importance. What is more important is that in order for a custom
or innovation to be preserved, there were two distinct prerequisites. Firstly,
there must have existed some conditions that made possible the preservation
through generations of certain practices whose benefits were not necessarily
understood or appreciated. Secondly, there must have been the acquisition
of distinct advantages by those groups that kept to such customs, thereby
enabling them to expand more rapidly than others and ultimately to
supersede (or absorb) those not possessing similar customs.
Trade Older than the State

That the human race eventually was able to occupy most of the earth as
densely as it has done, enabling it to maintain large numbers even in
regions where hardly any necessities of life can be produced locally, is
the result of mankind's having learnt, like a single colossal body
stretching itself, to extend to the remotest corners and pluck from each
area different ingredients needed to nourish the whole. Indeed, it will
perhaps not be long before even Antarctica will enable thousands of
miners to earn an ample livelihood. To an observer from space, this
covering of the earth's surface, with the increasingly changing
appearance that it wrought, night seem like an organic growth. But it
was no such thing: it was accomplished by individuals following not
instinctual demands but traditional customs and rules.
These individual traders and hosts rarely know (as their predecessors
rarely knew) all that much about the particular individual needs they
serve. Nor do they need such knowledge. Many of these needs will

THE FATAL CONCEIT

EVOLUTION OF THE MARKET: TRADE AND CIVILISATION

indeed not even arise until a time so far in the future that nobody can
foresee even its general outlines.
The more one learns about economic history, the more misleading
then seems the belief that the achievement of a highly organised state
constituted the culmination of the early development of civilisation. The
role played by governments is greatly exaggerated in historical accounts
because we necessarily know so much more about what organised
government did than about what the spontaneous coordination of
individual efforts accomplished. This deception, which stems from the
nature of those things preserved, such as documents and monuments, is
exemplified by the story (which I hope is apocryphal) about the
archaeologist who concluded from the fact that the earliest reports of
particular prices were inscribed on a stone pillar that prices had always
been set by governments. Yet this is hardly worse than finding, in a
well-known work, the argument that, since no suitable open spaces were
found in the excavation of Babylonian cities, no regular markets could
as yet have existed there - as if in a hot climate such markets would
have been held in the open!
Governments have more often hindered than initiated the development of long-distance trade. Those that gave greater independence and
security to individuals engaged in trading benefited from the increased
i nformation and larger population that resulted. Yet, when governments
became aware how dependent their people had become on the
i mportation of certain essential foodstuffs and materials, they themselves often endeavoured to secure these supplies in one way or another.
Some early governments, for instance, after first learning from
individual trade of the very existence of desirable resources, tried to
obtain these resources by organising military or colonising expeditions.
The Athenians were not the first and certainly not the last to attempt to
do so. But it is absurd to conclude from this, as some modern writers
have done (Polanyi, 1945, 1977), that, at the time of Athens's greatest
prosperity and growth, its trade was `administered', regulated by
government through treaties and conducted at fixed prices.
Rather, it would seem as if, over and over again, powerful
governments so badly damaged spontaneous improvement that the
process of cultural evolution was brought to an early demise. The
Byzantine government of the East Roman Empire may be one instance
of this (Rostovtzeff, 1930, and Einaudi, 1948). And the history of China
provides many instances of government attempts to enforce so perfect
an order that innovation became impossible (Needham, 1954). This
country, technologically and scientifically developed so far ahead of
Europe that, to give only one illustration, it had ten oil wells operating
on one stretch of the river Po already in the twelfth century, certainly

How little the wealth of the leading Greek trading centers, especially at
Athens and later at Corinth, was the result of deliberate governmental
policy, and how little the true source of this prosperity was understood,
is perhaps best illustrated by Aristotle's utter incomprehension of the
advanced market order in which he lived. Although he is sometimes
cited as the first economist, what he discussed as oikonomia was
exclusively the running of a household or at most of an individual
enterprise such as a farm. For the acquisitive efforts of the market, the
study of which he called chrematistika, he had only scorn. Although the
lives of the Athenians of his day depended on grain trade with distant
countries, his ideal order remained one that was autarkos, self-sufficient.
Although also acclaimed as a biologist, Aristotle lacked any perception
of two crucial aspects of the formation of any complex structure,
namely, evolution and the self-formation of order. As Ernst Mayr
(1982:306) puts it: `The idea that the universe could have developed
from an original chaos, or that higher organisms could have evolved
from lower ones, was totally alien to Aristotle's thought. To repeat,
Aristotle was opposed to evolution of any kind.' He seems not to have
noticed the sense of `nature' (or physis) as describing the process of
growth (see Appendix A), and also seems to have been unfamiliar with
several distinctions among self-forming orders that had been known to
the pre-Socratic philosophers, such as that between a spontaneously
grown kosmos and a deliberately arranged order as that of an army,
which earlier thinkers had called a taxis ( Hayek, 1973:37). For Aristotle,
all order of human activities was taxis, the result of deliberate
organisation of individual action by an ordering mind. As we saw
earlier (chapter one), he expressly stated that order could be achieved
only in a place small enough for everyone to hear the herald's cry, a
place which could be easily surveyed (eusynoptos, Politeia: 1326b and
1327a). `An excessively large number', he declared (1326a), `cannot
participate in order'.
To Aristotle, only the known needs of an existing population provided
a natural or legitimate justification for economic effort. Mankind, and
even nature, he treated as if they had always existed in their present

44

owed its later stagnation, but not its early progress, to the manipulatory
power of its governments. What led the greatly advanced civilisation of
China to fall behind Europe was its governments' clamping down so
tightly as to leave no room for new developments, while, as remarked in
the last chapter, Europe probably owes its extraordinary expansion in
the Middle Ages to its political anarchy (Baechler, 1975:77).
The Philosopher's Blindness

THE FATAL CONCEIT

EVOLUTION OF THE MARKET: TRADE AND CIVILISATION

form. This static view left no room for a conception of evolution, and
prevented him from even asking how existing institutions had arisen.
That most existing communities, and certainly the greater number of
his fellow Athenians, could not have come into existence had their
forefathers remained content to satisfy their known present needs,
appears never to have occurred to him. The experimental process of
adaptation to unforeseen change by the observation of abstract rules
which, when successful, could lead to an increase of numbers and the
formation of regular patterns, was alien to him. Thus Aristotle also set
the pattern for a common approach to ethical theory, one under which
clues to the usefulness of rules that are offered by history go
unrecognised, one under which no thought of analysing usefulness from
an economic standpoint ever occurs - since the theorist is oblivious to
the problems whose solutions might be embodied in such rules.
Since only actions aiming at perceived benefit to others were, to Aristotle's
mind, morally approved, actions solely for personal gain must be bad.
That commercial considerations may not have affected the daily
activities of most people does not mean however that over any
prolonged period their very lives did not depend on the functioning of a
trade that enabled them to buy essentials. That production for gain
which Aristotle denounced as unnatural had - long before his time already become the foundation of an extended order far transcending
the known needs of other persons.
As we now know, in the evolution of the structure of human activities,
profitability works as a signal that guides selection towards what makes
man more fruitful; only what is more profitable will, as a rule, nourish
more people, for it sacrifices less than it adds. So much was at least
sensed by some Greeks prior to Aristotle. Indeed, in the fifth century that is, before Aristotle - the first truly great historian began his history
of the Peloponnesian War by reflecting how early people `without
commerce, without freedom of communication either by land or sea,
cultivating no more of their territory than the exigencies of life required,
could never rise above nomadic life' and consequently `neither built
large cities nor attained to any other form of greatness' (Thucydides,
Crawly translation, 1,1,2). But Aristotle ignored this insight.
Had the Athenians followed Aristotle's counsel - counsel blind both
to economics and to evolution - their city would rapidly have shrunk
into a village, for his view of human ordering led him to an ethics
appropriate only to, if anywhere at all, a stationary state. Nonetheless
his doctrines came to dominate philosophical and religious thinking for
the next two thousand years - despite the fact that much of that same
philosophical and religious thinking took place within a highly dynamic,
rapidly extending, order.

The repercussions of Aristotle's systematisation of the morals of the
micro-order were amplified with the adoption of Aristotelian teaching in
the thirteenth century by Thomas Aquinas, which later led to the
proclamation of Aristotelian ethics as virtually the official teaching of
the Roman Catholic Church. The anti-commercial attitude of the
mediaeval and early modern Church, condemnation of interest as
usury, its teaching of the just price, and its contemptuous treatment of
gain is Aristotelian through and through.
By the eighteenth century, of course, Aristotle's influence in such
matters (as in others) was weakening. David Hume saw that the market
made it possible `to do a service to another without bearing him a real
kindness' (1739/1886:11, 289) or even knowing him; or to act to the
` advantage of the public, though it be not intended for that purpose by
another' (1739/1886:11, 296), by an order in which it was in the
`interest, even of bad men to act for the public good'. With such
insights, the conception of a self-organising structure began to dawn
upon mankind, and has since become the basis of our understanding of
all those complex orders which had, until then, appeared as miracles
that could be brought about only by some super-human version of what
man knew as his own mind. Now it gradually became understood how
the market enabled each, within set limits, to use his own individual
knowledge for his own individual purposes while being ignorant of most
of the order into which he had to fit his actions.
Notwithstanding, and indeed wholly neglecting, the existence of this
great advance, a view that is still permeated by Aristotelian thought, a
naive and childlike animistic view of the world (Piaget, 1929:359), has
come to dominate social theory and is the foundation of socialist
thought.

46

FOUR

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON

Although Aristotle was blind to the importance of trade, and lacked any
comprehension of evolution; and though Aristotelian thought, once
embedded in the system of Thomas Aquinas, supported the anticommercial attitudes of the mediaeval and early modern Church, it was
nonetheless only rather later, and chiefly among seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century French thinkers, that several important developments occurred which, taken together, began effectively to challenge the
central values and institutions of the extended order.
The first of these developments was the growing importance,
associated with the rise of modern science, of that particular form of
rationalism that I call 'constructivism' or `scientism' (after the French),
which for the following several centuries virtually captured serious
thought about reason and its role in human affairs. This particular form
of rationalism has been the point of departure of investigations that I
have conducted over the past sixty years, investigations in which I tried
to show that it is particularly ill-considered, embedding a false theory of
science and of rationality in which reason is abused, and which, most
i mportant here, leads invariably to an erroneous interpretation of the
nature and coming into being of human institutions. That interpretation
is one by which, in the name of reason and the highest values of
civilisation, moralists end up flattering the relatively unsuccessful and
inciting people to satisfy their primitive desires.
Descending in the modern period from Rene Descartes, this form of
rationalism not only discards tradition, but claims that pure reason can
directly serve our desires without any such intermediary, and can build

a new world, a new morality, a new law, even a new and purified
language, from itself alone. Although the theory is plainly false (see also
Popper, 1934/1959, and 1945/66), it still dominates the thinking of most
scientists, and also of most literati, artists, and intellectuals.
I should perhaps immediately qualify what I have just written by
adding that there are other strands within what might be called
rationalism which treat these matters differently, as for example that
which views rules of moral conduct as themselves part of reason. Thus
John Locke had explained that 'by reason, however, I do not think is
meant here the faculty of understanding which forms trains of thoughts
and deduces proofs, but definite principles of action from which spring
all virtues and whatever is necessary for the moulding of morals'
(1954:11). Yet views such as Locke's remain much in the minority
among those who call themselves rationalists.
The second, related development which challenged the extended
order arose from the work and influence of Jean Jacques Rousseau.
This peculiar thinker - although often described as irrationalist or
romantic - also latched on to and deeply depended on Cartesian
thought. Rousseau's heady brew of ideas came to dominate `progressive'
thought, and led people to forget that freedom as a political institution
had arisen not by human beings `striving for freedom' in the sense of
release from restraints, but by their striving for the protection of a
known secure individual domain. Rousseau led people to forget that
rules of conduct necessarily constrain and that order is their product;
and that these rules, precisely by limiting the range of means that each
individual may use for his purposes, greatly extend the range of ends
each can successfully pursue.
It was Rousseau who - declaring in the opening statement of The
Social Contract that `man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains',
and wanting to free men from all `artificial' restraints - made what had
been called the savage the virtual hero of progressive intellectuals,
urged people to shake off the very restraints to which they owed their
productivity and numbers, and produced a conception of liberty that
became the greatest obstacle to its attainment. After asserting that
animal instinct was a better guide to orderly cooperation among men
than either tradition or reason, Rousseau invented the fictitious will of
the people, or `general will', through which the people `becomes one
single being, one individual' (Social Contract, I, vii; and see Popper,
1945/1966:11, 54). This is perhaps the chief source of the fatal conceit
of modern intellectual rationalism that promises to lead us back to a
paradise wherein our natural instincts rather than learnt restraints upon
them will enable us `to subdue the world', as we are instructed in the
book of Genesis.

48

49

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON

It is necessary to guard ourselves from thinking that the practice of the
scientific method enlarges the powers of the human mind. Nothing is
more flatly contradicted by experience than the belief that a man
distinguished in one or even more departments of science, is more likely
to think sensibly about ordinary affairs than anyone else.
Wilfred Trotter
The Challenge to Property

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON

The admittedly great seductive appeal of this view hardly owes its
power (whatever it may claim) to reason and evidence. As we have
seen, the savage was far from free; nor could he have subdued the
world. He could indeed do little unless the whole group to which he
belonged agreed. Individual decision presupposed individual spheres of
control, and thus became possible only with the evolution of several
property, whose development, in turn, laid the foundation for the
growth of an extended order transcending the perception of the
headman or chief - or of the collectivity.
Despite these contradictions, there is no doubt that Rousseau's outcry
was effective or that, during the past two centuries, it has shaken our
civilisation. Moreover, irrationalist as it is, it nonetheless did appeal
precisely to progressivists by its Cartesian insinuation that we might use
reason to obtain and justify direct gratification of our natural instincts.
After Rousseau gave intellectual license to throw off cultural restraints,
to confer legitimacy on attempts to gain `freedom' from the restraints
that had made freedom possible, and to call this attack on the
foundation of freedom `liberation', property became increasingly suspect
and was no longer so widely recognised as the key factor that had
brought about the extended order. It was increasingly supposed, rather,
that rules regulating the delimitation and transfer of several property
might be replaced by central decision about its use.
Indeed, by the nineteenth century, serious intellectual appreciation
and discussion of the role of property in the development of civilisation
would seem to have fallen under a kind of ban in many quarters.
During this time property gradually became suspect among many of
those who might have been expected to investigate it, a topic to be
avoided by progressive believers in a rational reshaping of the structure
of human cooperation. (That this ban has persisted into the twentieth
century is evinced by, for example, Brian Barry's declarations (1961:80)
about usage and `analyticity', wherein justice `is now analytically tied to
"desert" and "need", so that one could say quite properly that some of
what Hume called "rules of justice" were unjust', and Gunnar Myrdal's
later mocking remark about the `taboos of property and contract'
(1969:17).) The founders of anthropology, for instance, increasingly
neglected the cultural role of property, so that in E. B. Tylor's two
volumes on Primitive Culture (1871), for instance, neither property nor
ownership appear in the index, while E. Westermarck - who did devote
a long chapter to property - already treats it, under the influence of
Saint-Simon and Marx, as the objectionable source of `unearned
income', and concludes from this that the `law of property will sooner or
later undergo a radical change' (1908:11, 71). The socialist bias of
constructivism has also influenced contemporary archaeology, but it

displays its inability to comprehend economic phenomena most crudely
in sociology (and even worse in the so-called `sociology of knowledge').
Sociology itself might almost be called a socialist science, having been
openly presented as capable of creating a new order of socialism (Ferri,
1895), or more recently able `to predict the future development and to
shape the future, or ... create the future of mankind' (Segerstedt,
1969:441). Like the 'naturology' that once pretended to replace all
specialised investigations of nature, sociology proceeds in sovereign
disregard of knowledge gained by established disciplines that have long
studied such grown structures as law, language, and the market.
I have just written that the study of traditional institutions such as
property `fell under a ban'. This is hardly an exaggeration, for it is
highly curious that so interesting and important a process as the
evolutionary selection of moral traditions has been so little studied, and
the direction these traditions gave to the development of civilisation so
largely ignored. Of course this will not seem so peculiar to a
constructivist. If one suffers under the delusion of `social engineering',
the notion that man can consciously choose where he wants to go, it will
not seem so important to discover how he reached his present situation.

50

51

It may be mentioned in passing, although I cannot explore the matter here,
that challenges to property and traditional values came not only from
followers of Rousseau: they also stemmed, although perhaps less
i mportantly, from religion. For the revolutionary movements of this period
(rationalistic socialism and then communism) helped to revive old heretical
traditions of religious revolt against basic institutions of property and family
- revolts directed in earlier centuries by heretics such as the Gnostics, the
Manichaeans, the Bogomils, and the Cathars. By the nineteenth century,
these particular heretics were gone, but thousands of new religious
revolutionaries appeared who directed much of their zeal against both
property and the family, also appealing to primitive instincts against such
restraints. Rebellion against private property and the family was, in short,
not restricted to socialists. Mystic and supernatural beliefs were invoked not
only to justify customary restraints upon instincts, as for example in the
dominant streams of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, but also, in
more peripheral movements, to support the release of instincts.
Limits of space as well as insufficient competence forbid me to deal in this
book with the second of the traditional objects of atavistic reaction that I
have just mentioned: the family. I ought however at least to mention that I
believe that new factual knowledge has in some measure deprived traditional
rules of sexual morality of some of their foundation, and that it seems likely
that in this area substantial changes are bound to occur.

THE FATAL CONCEIT

Having mentioned Rousseau and his pervasive influence, as well as
these other historical developments, if only to remind readers that the
revolt against property and traditional morality on the part of serious
thinkers is not just comparatively recent, I shall turn now to some
twentieth-century intellectual heirs of Rousseau and Descartes.
First, however, I should emphasise that I am largely neglecting here
the long history of this revolt, as well as the different turns it has taken
in different lands. Long before Auguste Comte introduced the term
` positivism' for the view that represented a `demonstrated ethics'
(demonstrated by reason, that is) as the only possible alternative to a
supernaturally `revealed ethics' (1854:1, 356), Jeremy Bentham had
developed the most consistent foundations of what we now call legal
and moral positivism: that is, the constructivistic interpretation of
systems of law and morals according to which their validity and
meaning are supposed to depend wholly on the will and intention of
their designers. Bentham is himself a late figure in this development.
This constructivism includes not only the Benthamite tradition,
represented and continued by John Stuart Mill and the later English
Liberal Party, but also practically all contemporary Americans who call
themselves `liberals' (as opposed to some other very different thinkers,
more often found in Europe, who are also called liberals, who are better
called `old Whigs', and whose outstanding thinkers were Alexis de
Tocqueville and Lord Acton). This constructivist way of thinking
becomes virtually inevitable if, as an acute contemporary Swiss analyst
suggests, one accepts the prevailing liberal (read `socialist') philosophy
that assumes that man, so far as the distinction between good and bad
has any significance for him at all, must, and can, himself deliberately
draw the line between them (Kirsch, 1981:17).
Our Intellectuals and Their Tradition of Reasonable Socialism

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON

indeed been so profound and pervasive that, in general, the more
intelligent an educated person is, the more likely he or she now is not
only to be a rationalist, but also to hold socialist views (regardless of
whether he or she is sufficiently doctrinal to attach to his or her views
any label, including `socialist'). The higher we climb up the ladder of
intelligence, the more we talk with intellectuals, the more likely we are
to encounter socialist convictions. Rationalists tend to be intelligent and
intellectual; and intelligent intellectuals tend to be socialists.
If I may insert two personal remarks here, I suppose that I can claim to
speak with some experience about this outlook because these rationalist
views that I have been systematically examining and criticising now for so
many years are those on which I, in common with most non-religious
European thinkers of my generation, formed my own outlook in the early
part of this century. At that time they appeared self-evident, and following
them seemed the way to escape pernicious superstitions of all sorts. Having
myself spent some time in struggling free from these notions - indeed,
discovering in the process that they themselves are superstitions - I can
hardly intend personally some of my rather harsh remarks about particular
authors in the pages that follow.
Moreover, it is perhaps appropriate to remind readers in this place of my
essay `On Why I Am Not a Conservative' (1960: Postscript), lest they draw
inaccurate conclusions. Although my argument is directed against socialism,
I am as little a Tory-Conservative as was Edmund Burke. My conservatism,
such as it is, is entirely confined to morals within certain limits. I am entirely
in favour of experimentation - indeed for very much more freedom than
conservative governments tend to allow. What I object to among rationalist
intellectuals such as those I shall be discussing is not that they experiment;
rather, they experiment all too little, and what they fancy to be
experimentation turns out mostly to be banal - after all, the idea of
returning to instinct is really as common as rain and has by now been tried
out so often that it is no longer clear in what sense it can any longer be
called experimental. I object to such rationalists because they declare their
experiments, such as they are, to be the results of reason, dress them up in
pseudo-scientific methodology, and thus, whilst wooing influential recruits
and subjecting invaluable traditional practices (the result of ages of
evolutionary trial-and-error experiment) to unfounded attack, shelter their
own `experiments' from scrutiny.

What I have suggested about morals and tradition, about economics
and the market, and about evolution, obviously conflicts with many
influential ideas, not only with the old Social Darwinism discussed in
the first chapter, which is no longer widely held, but also with many
other viewpoints past and present: with the views of Plato and Aristotle,
of Rousseau and the founders of socialism, with those of Saint-Simon,
Karl Marx, and many others,
Indeed, the basic point of my argument - that morals, including,
especially, our institutions of property, freedom and justice, are not a
creation of man's reason but a distinct second endowment conferred on
him by cultural evolution - runs counter to the main intellectual
outlook of the twentieth century. The influence of rationalism has

One's initial surprise at finding that intelligent people tend to be
socialists diminishes when one realises that, of course, intelligent people
will tend to overvalue intelligence, and to suppose that we must owe all
the advantages and opportunities that our civilisation offers to

52

THE FATAL CONCEIT

deliberate design rather than to following traditional rules, and likewise
to suppose that we can, by exercising our reason, eliminate any
remaining undesired features by still more intelligent reflection, and still
more appropriate design and `rational coordination' of our undertakings.
This leads one to be favourably disposed to the central economic
planning and control that lie at the heart of socialism. Of course
intellectuals will demand explanations for everything they are expected
to do, and will be reluctant to accept practices just because they happen
to govern the communities into which they happen to have been born;
and this will lead them into conflict with, or at least to a low opinion of,
those who quietly accept prevailing rules of conduct. Moreover, they
also understandably will want to align themselves with science and
reason, and with the extraordinary progress made by the physical
sciences during the past several centuries, and since they have been
taught that constructivism and scientism are what science and the use
of reason are all about, they find it hard to believe that there can exist
any useful knowledge that did not originate in deliberate experimentation,
or to accept the validity of any tradition apart from their own tradition
of reason. Thus a distinguished historian has written in this vein:
` Tradition is almost by definition reprehensible, something to be
mocked and deplored' (Seton-Watson, 1983:1270).
By definition: Barry (1961, mentioned above) wanted to make morality and
justice immoral and unjust by `analytic definition'; here Seton-Watson
would try the same manoeuvre with tradition, making it by definition
reprehensible. We shall return to these words, to this 'Newspeak', in chapter
seven. Meanwhile let us look more closely at the facts.

These reactions are all understandable, but they have consequences.
The consequences are particularly dangerous - to reason as well as to
morality - when preference not so much for the real products of reason
as for this conventional tradition of reason leads intellectuals to ignore
the theoretical limits of reason, to disregard a world of historical and
scientific information, to remain ignorant of the biological sciences and
the sciences of man such as economics, and to misrepresent the origin
and functions of our traditional moral rules.
Like other traditions, the tradition of reason is learnt, not innate. It
too lies between instinct and reason; and the question of the real reasonableness
and truth of this tradition of proclaimed reason and truth must now also
scrupulously be examined.

54

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON
Morals and Reason: Some Examples

Lest I be thought to exaggerate, I shall provide, in a moment, a few
examples. But I do not want to be unfair to our great scientists and
philosophers, some of whose ideas I shall discuss. Although they, in
their own opinions, illustrate the significance of the problem - that our
philosophy and natural science are far from understanding the role
played by our chief traditions - they themselves are not usually directly
responsible for the wide dissemination of these ideas, for they have
better things to do. On the other hand, it should also not be supposed
that the remarks I am about to cite are merely momentary or
idiosyncratic aberrations on the part of their distinguished authors:
rather, they are consistent conclusions drawn from a well-established
rationalist tradition. And indeed I do not doubt that some of these great
thinkers have striven to comprehend the extended order of human
cooperation - if only to end as determined, and often unwitting,
opponents of this order.
Those who have really done most to spread these ideas, the real
bearers of constructivist rationalism and socialism, are, however, not
these distinguished scientists. They rather tend to be the so-called
`intellectuals' that I have elsewhere (1949/1967:178-94) unkindly called
professional `second-hand dealers in ideas': teachers, journalists and
` media representatives' who, having absorbed rumours in the corridors
of science, appoint themselves as representatives of modern thought, as
persons superior in knowledge and moral virtue to any who retain a
high regard for traditional values, as persons whose very duty it is to
offer new ideas to the public - and who must, in order to make their
wares seem novel, deride whatever is conventional. For such people,
due to the positions in which they find themselves, `newness', or `news',
and not truth, becomes the main value, although that is hardly their
intention - and although what they offer is often no more new than it is
true. Moreover, one might wonder whether these intellectuals are not
sometimes inspired by resentment that they, knowing better what ought
to be done, are paid so much less than those whose instructions and
activities in fact guide practical affairs. Such literary interpreters of
scientific and technological advance, of which H. G. Wells, because of
the unusually high quality of his work, would be an excellent example,
have done far more to spread the socialist ideal of a centrally directed
economy in which each is assigned his due share than have the real
scientists from whom they have cadged many of their notions. Another
such example is that of the early George Orwell, who once argued that
` anyone who uses his brain knows perfectly well that it is within the
range of possibility [that] the world, potentially at least, is extremely
55

THE FATAL CONCEIT

rich' such that we could `develop it as it might be developed, and we
could all live like princes, supposing that we wanted to'.
I shall concentrate here not on the work of men like Wells and
Orwell, but on views propounded by some of the greatest scientists. We
might begin with Jacques Monod. Monod was a great figure whose
scientific work I much admire, and was, essentially, the creator of
modern molecular biology. His reflections on ethics, however, were of a
different quality. In 1970, in a Nobel Foundation symposium concerning `The Place of Values in a World of Facts', he stated: `Scientific
development has finally destroyed, reduced to absurdity, relegated to
the state of nonsensical wishful thinking, the idea that ethics and values
are not a matter of our free choice but are rather a matter of obligation
for us' (1970:20-21). Later that year, to re-emphasise his views, he
argued the same case in a book now famous, Chance and Necessity
(1970/1977). There he enjoins us, ascetically renouncing all other
spiritual nourishment, to acknowledge science as the new and virtually
exclusive source of truth, and to revise the foundations of ethics
accordingly. The book ends like so many similar pronouncements with
the idea that `ethics, in essence nonobjective, is forever barred from the
sphere of knowledge' (1970/77:162). The new `ethic of knowledge does
not impose itself on man; on the contrary, it is he who imposes it upon himself
(1970/77:164). This new `ethic of knowledge' is, Monod says, `the only
attitude which is both rational and resolutely idealistic, and on which a
real socialism might be built' (1970/77:165-66). Monod's ideas are
characteristic in that they are deeply rooted in a theory of knowledge
that has attempted to develop a science of behaviour - whether called
eudaimonism, utilitarianism, socialism, or whatever - on the grounds
that certain sorts of behaviour better satisfy our wishes. We are advised to
behave in such a way as will permit given situations to satisfy our
desires, and make us happier, and such like. In other words, what is
wanted is an ethics that men can deliberately follow to reach known,
desired, and pre-selected aims.
Monod's conclusions stem from his opinion that the only other
possible way to account for the origin of morals - apart from ascribing
them to human invention - is by animistic or anthropomorphic
accounts such as are given in many religions. And it is indeed true that
` for mankind as a whole all religions have been intertwined with the
anthropomorphic view of the deity as a father, friend or potentate to
whom men must do service, pray, etc.' (M. R. Cohen, 1931:112). This
aspect of religion I can as little accept as can Monod and the majority
of natural scientists. It seems to me to lower something far beyond our
comprehension to the level of a slightly superior manlike mind. But to
reject this aspect of religion does not preclude our recognising that we
56

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON

may owe to these religions the preservation - admittedly for false
reasons - of practices that were more important in enabling man to
survive in large numbers than most of what has been accomplished
through reason (see chapter nine below).
Monod is not the only biologist to argue along such lines. A
statement by another great biologist and very learned scholar illustrates
better than almost any other I have come across the absurdities to
which supreme intelligence can be led by a misinterpretation of the
`laws of evolution' (see chapter one above). Joseph Needham writes that
`the new world order of social justice and comradeship, the rational and
classless state, is no wild idealistic dream, but a logical extrapolation
from the whole course of evolution, having no less authority than that
behind it, and therefore of all faiths the most rational' (J. Needham,
1943:41).
I shall return to Monod, but want first to assemble a few further
examples. A particularly appropriate instance that I have discussed
elsewhere (1978), is John Maynard Keynes, one of the most
representative intellectual leaders of a generation emancipated from
traditional morals. Keynes believed that, by taking account of
foreseeable effects, he could build a better world than by submitting
to traditional abstract rules. Keynes used the phrase `conventional
wisdom' as a favourite expression of scorn, and, in a revealing
autobiographical account (1938/49/72: X, 446), he told how the
Cambridge circle of his younger years, most of whose members later
belonged to the Bloomsbury Group, `entirely repudiated a personal
liability on us to obey general rules', and how they were `in the strict
sense of the term, immoralists'. He modestly added that, at the age of
fifty-five, he was too old to change and would remain an immoralist.
This extraordinary man also characteristically justified some of his
economic views, and his general belief in a management of the market
order, on the ground that `in the long run we are all dead' (i.e., it does
not matter what long-range damage we do; it is the present moment
alone, the short run - consisting of public opinion, demands, votes, and
all the stuff and bribes of demagoguery - which counts). The slogan
that `in the long run we are all dead' is also a characteristic
manifestation of an unwillingness to recognise that morals are
concerned with effects in the long run - effects beyond our possible perception
- and of a tendency to spurn the learnt discipline of the long view.
Keynes also argued against the moral tradition of the `virtue of saving',
refusing, along with thousands of crank economists, to admit that a
reduction of the demand for consumers' goods is generally required to make
an increase of the production of capital goods (i.e., investment) possible.
57

THE FATAL CONCEIT
And this in turn led him to devote his formidable intellectual powers to
develop his `general' theory of economics - to which we owe the unique
world-wide inflation of the third quarter of our century and the inevitable
consequence of severe unemployment that has followed it (Hayek,
1972/1978).
Thus it was not philosophy alone that confused Keynes. It was also
economics. Alfred Marshall, who understood the matter, seems to have
failed to impress adequately upon Keynes one of the important insights that
John Stuart Mill had gained in his youth: namely, that `the demand for
commodities is not a demand for labour'. Sir Leslie Stephen (the father of
Virginia Woolf, another member of the Bloomsbury group) described this
doctrine in 1876 as a `doctrine so rarely understood, that its complete
appreciation is, perhaps, the best test of an economist' - and was ridiculed
for saying so by Keynes. (See Hayek, 1970/78:15-16, 1973:25, and (on Mill
and Stephen) 1941:4331f.)
Although Keynes was, in spite of himself, to contribute greatly to the
weakening of freedom, he shocked his Bloomsbury friends by not
sharing their general socialism; yet most of his students were socialists
of one sort or other. Neither he nor these students recognised how the
extended order must be based on long-run considerations.
The philosophic illusion that lay behind the views of Keynes, that
there exists an indefinable attribute of `goodness' - one to be discovered
by every individual, which imposes on each a duty to pursue it, and
whose recognition justifies contempt for and disregard of much of
traditional morals (a view which through the work of G. E. Moore
(1903) dominated the Bloomsbury group) - produced a characteristic
enmity to the sources on which he fed. This was evident for instance
also in E. M. Forster, who seriously argued that freeing mankind from
the evils of `commercialism' had become as urgent as had been freeing it
from slavery.
Sentiments similar to those of Monod and Keynes come from a less
distinguished yet still influential scientist: the psychoanalyst who
became the first Secretary General of the World Health Organisation,
G. B. Chisholm. Chisholm advocated no less than `the eradication of the
concept of right and wrong' and maintained that it was the task of the
psychiatrist to free the human race from `the crippling burden of good
and evil' - advice which at the time received praise from high American
legal authority. Here again, morality is seen - since it is not
`scientifically' grounded - as irrational, and its status as embodiment of
accumulated cultural knowledge goes unrecognised.
Let us turn, however, to a scientist even greater than Monod or
Keynes, to Albert Einstein, perhaps the greatest genius of our age.

58

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON
Einstein was concerned with a different yet closely related theme. Using
a popular socialist slogan, he wrote that `production for use' ought to
replace the `production for profit' of the capitalist order (1956:129).
` Production for use' means here the kind of work which, in the small group,
is guided by anticipating for whose use the product is intended. But this
sentiment fails to take into account the sorts of considerations advanced in
the foregoing chapters, and to be argued again in the following: only the
differences between expected prices for different commodities and services
and their costs, in the self-generating order of the market, tell the individual
how best to contribute to the pool from which we all draw in proportion to
our contribution. Einstein appears to have been unaware that only
calculation and distribution in terms of market prices make it possible to
utilise our discoverable resources intensively, to guide production to serve
ends lying beyond the range of the producer's perception, and to enable the
individual to participate usefully in productive exchange (first, by serving
people, mostly unknown to him, to the gratification of whose needs he can
nonetheless effectively contribute; and second, by himself being supplied as
well as he is only because people who know nothing about his existence are
induced, also by market signals, to provide for his needs: see the previous
chapter). In following such sentiments Einstein shows his lack of
comprehension of, or real interest in, the actual processes by which human
efforts are coordinated.
Einstein's biographer reports that Einstein regarded it as obvious that
` human reason must be capable of finding a method of distribution
which would work as effectively as that of production' (Clark, 1971:559)
- a description that reminds one of the philosopher Bertrand Russell's
claim that a society could not be regarded as `fully scientific' unless `it
has been created deliberately with a certain structure to fulfil certain
purposes' (1931:203). Such demands, particularly in Einstein's mouth,
seemed so superficially plausible that even a sensible philosopher,
twitting Einstein for talking beyond his competence in some of his
popular writings, stated approvingly that `Einstein is clearly aware that
the present economic crisis is due to our system of production for profit
rather than for use, to the fact that our tremendous increase of
productive power is not actually followed by a corresponding increase in
the purchasing power of the great masses' (M. R. Cohen, 1931:119).
We also find Einstein repeating (in the essay cited) familiar phrases
of socialist agitation about the `economic anarchy of capitalist society'
in which `the payment of the workers is not determined by the value of
the product', while `a planned economy ... would distribute the work
to be done among all those able to work', and such like.

59

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON

A similar but more guarded view appears in an essay by Einstein's
collaborator Max Born (1968: chap.5). While Born evidently realised
that our extended order no longer gratified primitive instincts, he too
failed to examine closely the structures that create and maintain this
order, or to see that our instinctual morals have over the past five
thousand years or more gradually been replaced or restrained. Thus,
although perceiving that `science and technology have destroyed the
ethical basis of civilisation, perhaps irreparably', he imagines that they
have done so by the facts they have uncovered rather than by their
having systematically discredited beliefs that fail to satisfy certain
` standards of acceptability' demanded by constructivist rationalism (see
below). While admitting that `no one has yet devised a means of
keeping society together without traditional ethical principles', Born yet
hopes that these can be replaced `by means of the traditional method
used in science'. He too fails to see that what lies between instinct and
reason cannot be replaced by `the traditional method used in science'.

The ideas raised in these examples have in common a number of closely
interconnected thematic roots, roots that are not just matters of
common historical antecedents. Readers unfamiliar with some of the
background literature may not immediately see some of the interconnections. Hence I should like, before further probing these ideas
themselves, to identify a number of recurring themes - most of which
may appear at first glance' to be unobjectionable and all of which are
familiar - which, taken together, form a sort of argument. This
` argument' could also be described as a litany of errors, or as a recipe
for producing the presumptive rationalism that I call scientism and
constructivism. To start on our way, let us consult that ready `source of
knowledge', the dictionary, a book containing many recipes. I have

gathered from the very useful Fontana/Harper Dictionary of Modern Thought
(1977) a few short definitions of four basic philosophical concepts that
generally guide contemporary thinkers educated along scientistic and
constructivistic lines: rationalism, empiricism, positivism, and utilitarianism - concepts which have, during the past several hundred years,
come to be regarded as representative expressions of the scientific `spirit
of the age'. According to these definitions, which are written by Lord
Quinton, a British philosopher who is President of Trinity College,
Oxford, rationalism denies the acceptability of beliefs founded on
anything but experience and reasoning, deductive or inductive.
Empiricism maintains that all statements claiming to express knowledge
are limited to those depending for their justification on experience.
Positivism is defined as the view that all true knowledge is scientific, in
the sense of describing the coexistence and succession of observable
phenomena. And utilitarianism `takes the pleasure and pain of everyone
affected by it to be the criterion of the action's rightness'.
In such definitions one finds quite explicitly, just as one finds
i mplicitly in the examples cited in the preceding section, the
declarations of faith of modern science and philosophy of science, and
their declarations of war against moral traditions. These declarations,
definitions, postulates, have created the impression that only that which
is rationally justifiable, only that which is provable by observational
experiment, only that which can be experienced, only that which can be
surveyed, deserves belief; that only that which is pleasurable should be
acted upon, and that all else must be repudiated. This in turn leads
directly to the contention that the leading moral traditions that have
created and are creating our culture - which certainly cannot be
justified in such ways, and which are often disliked - are unworthy of
adherence, and that our task must be to construct a new morality on the
basis of scientific knowledge - usually the new morality of socialism.
These definitions, together with our earlier examples, when examined
more closely, prove indeed to contain the following presuppositions:
1) The idea that it is unreasonable to follow what one cannot justify
scientifically or prove observationally (Monod, Born).
2) The idea that it is unreasonable to follow what one does not
understand. This notion is implicit in all our examples, but I must
confess that I too once held it, and have also been able to find it in a
philosopher with whom I generally agree. Thus Sir Karl Popper once
claimed (1948/63:122; emphasis added) that rationalist thinkers `will
not submit blindly to any tradition', which is of course just as impossible
as obeying no tradition. This must, however, have been a slip of the
pen, for elsewhere he has rightly observed that `we never know what we
are talking about' (1974/1976:27, on which see also Bartley, 1985/1987).

My examples are taken from statements of important twentieth-century
figures; I have not included countless other such figures, such as R. A.
Millikan, Arthur Eddington, F. Soddy, W. Ostwald, E. Solvay, J. D.
Bernal, all of whom talked much nonsense on economic matters.
Indeed, one could cite hundreds of similar statements by scientists and
philosophers of comparable renown - both from centuries past and from
the present time. But we can, I believe, learn more by taking a closer
l ook at these particular contemporary examples - and at what lies
behind them - than simply by piling up citations and examples.
Perhaps the first thing to notice is that, although far from identical,
these examples have a certain family resemblance.
A Litany of Errors

(Though the free man will insist on his right to examine and, when
appropriate, to reject any tradition, he could not live among other
people if he refused to accept countless traditions without even thinking
about them, and of whose effects he remains ignorant.)
3) The related idea that it is unreasonable to follow a particular
course unless its purpose is fully specified in advance (Einstein, Russell,
Keynes).
4) The idea, also closely related, that it is unreasonable to do
anything unless its effects are not only fully known in advance but also
fully observable and seen to be beneficial (the utilitarians). (Assumptions 2, 3, and 4, are, despite their different emphases, nearly identical;
but I have distinguished them here to call attention to the fact that the
arguments for them turn, depending on who is defending them, either
on lack of understandability generally, or, more particularly, on lack of
specified purpose or lack of complete and observable knowledge of
effects.)

Some rationalists would want to advance an additional complaint that
we have hardly considered: namely, that the morality and institutions of
capitalism not only fail to meet the logical, methodological, and
epistemological requirements reviewed already, but also impose a
crippling burden on our freedom - as, for example, our freedom to
` express' ourselves unrestrainedly.
This complaint cannot be met by denying the obvious, a truth with

which we opened this book - that moral tradition does seem
burdensome to many - but can only be answered by observing again,
here and in subsequent chapters, what we derive from bearing this
burden, and what the alternative would be. Virtually all the benefits of
civilisation, and indeed our very existence, rest, I believe, on our
continuing willingness to shoulder the burden of tradition. These
benefits in no way 'justify' the burden. But the alternative is poverty
and famine.
Without attempting to recount or review all these benefits, to `count
our blessings', as it were, I may mention again, in a somewhat different
context, perhaps the most ironic benefit of all - for I have in mind our
very freedom. Freedom requires that the individual be allowed to
pursue his own ends: one who is free is in peacetime no longer bound by
the common concrete ends of his community. Such freedom of
individual decision is made possible by delimiting distinct individual
rights (the rights of property, for example) and designating domains
within which each can dispose over means known to him for his own
ends. That is, a recognisable free sphere is determined for each person.
This is all-important. For to have something of one's own, however
little, is also the foundation on which a distinctive personality can be
formed and a distinctive environment created within which particular
individual aims can be pursued.
But confusion has been created by the common supposition that it is
possible to have this kind of freedom without restraints. This
supposition appears in the apercu ascribed to Voltaire that 'quand je
peux faire ce que je veux, voila la liberte', in Bentham's declaration that
` every law is an evil, for every law is an infraction of liberty'
(1789/1887:48), in Bertrand Russell's definition of liberty as the
` absence of obstacles to the realisation of our desires' (1940:251), and in
countless other sources. General freedom in this sense is nevertheless
i mpossible, for the freedom of each would founder on the unlimited
freedom, i.e., the lack of restraint, of all others.
The question then is how to secure the greatest possible freedom for
all. This can be secured by uniformly restricting the freedom of all by
abstract rules that preclude arbitrary or discriminatory coercion by or
of other people, that prevent any from invading the free sphere of any
other (see Hayek 1960 and 1973, and chapter two above). In short,
common concrete ends are replaced by common abstract rules.
Government is needed only to enforce these abstract rules, and thereby
to protect the individual against coercion, or invasion of his free sphere,
by others. Whereas enforced obedience to common concrete ends is
tantamount to slavery, obedience to common abstract rules (however
burdensome they may still feel) provides scope for the most extra-

62

One could name further requirements, but these four - which we shall
examine in the following two chapters - will suffice for our (largely
illustrative) purposes. Two things might be noticed about these
requirements from the very start. First, not one of them shows any
awareness that there might be limits to our knowledge or reason in
certain areas, or considers that, in such circumstances, the most
i mportant task of science might be to discover what these limits are. We
shall learn below that there are such limits and that they can indeed
partially be overcome, as for example through the science of economics
or 'catallactics', but that they cannot be overcome if one holds to the above four
requirements. Second, one finds in the approach underlying the
requirements not only lack of understanding, not only the failure to
consider or deal with such problems, but also a curious lack of curiosity
about how our extended order actually came into being, how it is
maintained, and what the consequences might be of destroying those
traditions that created and maintain it.
Positive and Negative Liberty

THE FATAL CONCEIT

ordinary freedom and diversity. Although it is sometimes supposed that
such diversity brings chaos threatening the relative order that we also
associate with civilisation, it turns out that greater diversity bring s
greater order. Hence the type of liberty made possible by adhering t o
abstract rules, in contrast to freedom from restraint, is, as Proudhon
once put it, `the mother, not the daughter, of order'.
There is in fact no reason to expect that the selection by evolution of
habitual practices should produce happiness. The focus on happiness
was introduced by rationalist philosophers who supposed that a
conscious reason had to be discovered for the choice of men's morals,
and that that reason might prove to be the deliberate pursuit of
happiness. But to ask for the conscious reason why man adopted his
morals is as mistaken as to ask for what conscious reason man adopted
his reason.
Nevertheless, the possibility that the evolved order in which we live
provides us with opportunities for happiness that equal or exceed those
provided by primitive orders to far fewer people should not be dismissed
( which is not to say that such matters can be calculated). Much of the
` alienation' or unhappiness of modern life stems from two sources, one
of which affects primarily intellectuals, the other, all beneficiaries of
material abundance. The first is a self-fulfilling prophecy of unhappiness
for those within any `system' that does not satisfy rationalistic criteria of
conscious control. Thus intellectuals from Rousseau to such recent
figures in French and German thought as Foucault and Habermas
regard alienation as rampant in any system in which an order is
`i mposed' on individuals without their conscious consent; consequently,
their followers tend to find civilisation unbearable - by definition, as it
were. Secondly, the persistence of instinctual feelings of altruism and
solidarity subject those who follow the impersonal rules of the extended
order to what is now fashionably called `bad conscience'; similarly, the
acquisition of material success is supposed to be attended with feelings
of guilt (or `social conscience'). In the midst of plenty, then, there is
unhappiness not only born of peripheral poverty, but also of the
incompatibility, on the part of instinct and of a hubristic reason, with
an order that is of a decidedly non-instinctive and extra-rational
character.

THE REVOLT OF INSTINCT AND REASON

by general rules one's natural reactions of hostility to strangers and
solidarity with those who are like oneself- an ever more severe threat to
political liberty. Thus the notion of `liberation', although allegedly new,
is actually archaic in its demand for release from traditional morals.
Those who champion such liberation would destroy the basis of
freedom, and permit men to do what would irreparably break down
those conditions that make civilisation possible. One example appears
in so-called `liberation theology', especially within the Roman Catholic
church in South America. But this movement is not confined to South
America. Everywhere, in the name of liberation, people disavow
practices that enabled mankind to reach its present size and degree of
cooperation because they do not rationally see, according to their lights,
how certain limitations on individual freedom through legal and moral
rules make possible a greater - and freer! - order than can be attained
through centralised control.
Such demands stem chiefly from the tradition of rationalistic
liberalism that we have already discussed (so different from the political
liberalism deriving from the English Old Whigs), which implies that
freedom is incompatible with any general restriction on individual
action. This tradition voices itself in the passages cited earlier from
Voltaire, Bentham, and Russell. Unfortunately it also pervades even the
work of the English `saint of rationalism', John Stuart Mill.
Under the influence of these writers, and perhaps especially Mill, the
fact that we must purchase the freedom enabling us to form an extended
order at the cost of submitting to certain rules of conduct has been used
as a justification for the demand to return to the state of `liberty'
enjoyed by the savage who - as eighteenth-century thinkers defined him
- `did not yet know property'. Yet the savage state - which includes the
obligation or duty to share in pursuit of the concrete goals of one's
fellows, and to obey the commands of a headman - can hardly be
described as one of freedom (although it might involve liberation from
some particular burdens) or even as one of morals. Only those general
and abstract rules that one must take into account in individual
decisions in accordance with individual aims deserve the name of
morals.

`Liberation' and Order

On a less sophisticated level than the argument against `alienation' are
the demands for `liberation' from the burdens of civilisation - including
the burdens of disciplined work, responsibility, risk-taking, saving,
honesty, the honouring of promises, as well as the difficulties of curbing

THE FATAL CONCEIT

Traditional Morals Fail to Meet Rational Requirements

The four requirements just listed - that whatever is not scientifically
proven, or is not fully understood, or lacks a fully specified purpose, or
has some unknown effects, is unreasonable - are particularly well suited
to constructivist rationalism and to socialist thought. These two
approaches themselves flow from a mechanistic or physicalist interpretation of the extended order of human cooperation, that is, from
conceiving ordering as the sort of arranging and controlling one could
do with a group if one had access to all the facts known to its members.
But the extended order is not, and could not be, such an order.
Hence I wish to concede forthwith that most tenets, institutions, and
practices of traditional morality and of capitalism do not meet the
requirements or criteria stated and are -from the perspective of this theory of
reason and science - ` unreasonable' and `unscientific'. Moreover, since, as
we have also admitted, those who continue to follow traditional
practices do not themselves usually understand how these practices
were formed or how they endure, it is hardly surprising that alternative
justifications', so-called, that traditionalists sometimes offer for their
practices are often rather naive (and hence have provided fair game for
our intellectuals), and have no connection with the real reasons for their
success. Many traditionalists do not even bother with justifications that
could not be provided anyway (thus allowing intellectuals to denounce
them as anti-intellectual or dogmatic), but go on following their
practices out of habit or religious faith. Nor is this in any way `news'.
After all, it was over 250 years ago that Hume observed that `the rules
of morality are not the conclusions of our reason'. Yet Hume's claim has
not sufficed to deter most modern rationalists from continuing to believe
- curiously enough often quoting Hume in their support - that
something not derived from reason must be either nonsense or a matter
for arbitrary preference, and, accordingly, to continue to demand
rational justifications.
Not only the traditional tenets of religion, such as the belief in God,
and much traditional morality concerning sex and the family (matters
66

THE FATAL CONCEIT

with which I am not concerned in this book), fail to meet these
requirements, but also the specific moral traditions that do concern me
here, such as private property, saving, exchange, honesty, truthfulness,
contract.
The situation may look even worse if one considers that the
traditions, institutions and beliefs mentioned not only fail to meet the
logical, methodological, and epistemological requirements stated, but
that they are also often rejected by socialists on other grounds too. For
example, they are seen, as by Chisholm and Keynes, as a `crippling
burden', and also, as by Wells and Forster, as closely associated with
despicable trade and commerce (see chapter six). And they also may be
seen, as is especially fashionable today, as sources of alienation and
oppression, and of `social injustice'.
After such objections, the conclusion is reached that there is an
urgent need to construct a new, rationally revised and justified morality
which does meet these requirements, and which is, for that matter, one
which will not be a crippling burden, be alienating, oppressive, or
` unjust', or be associated with trade. Moreover, this is only part of the
great task that these new lawgivers - socialists such as Einstein, Monod
and Russell, and self-proclaimed 'immoralists' such as Keynes - set for
themselves. A new rational language and law must be constructed too,
for existing language and law also fail to meet these requirements, and
for what turn out to be the same reasons. (For that matter, even the
laws of science do not meet these requirements (Hume, 1739/1951; and
see Popper, 1934/59).) This awesome task may seem the more urgent to
them in that they themselves no longer believe in any supernatural
sanction for morality (let alone for language, law, and science) and yet
remain convinced that some justification is necessary.
So, priding itself on having built its world as if it had designed it, and
blaming itself for not having designed it better, humankind is now to set
out to do just that. The aim of socialism is no less than to effect a
complete redesigning of our traditional morals, law, and language, and
on this basis to stamp out the old order and the supposedly inexorable,
unjustifiable conditions that prevent the institution of reason, fulfilment,
true freedom, and justice.
justification and Revision of Traditional Morals

The rationalist standards on which this whole argument, indeed this
whole programme, rest, are however at best counsels of perfection and
at worst the discredited rules of an ancient methodology which may
have been incorporated into some of what is thought of as science, but
which has nothing to do with real investigation. A highly evolved,
67

THE FATAL CONCEIT

rather sophisticated moral system exists side by side, in our extended
order, with the primitive theory of rationality and of science sponsored
by constructivism, scientism, positivism, hedonism, and socialism. This
does not speak against reason and science but against these theories of
rationality and science, and some of the practice thereof. All this begins
to become evident when it is realised that nothing is justifiable in the way
demanded. Not only is this so of morals, but also of language and law
and even science itself.
That what I have just written applies to science too may be unfamiliar to
some who are not informed of current advances and controversies within the
philosophy of science. But it is indeed true not only that our current
scientific laws are not justified or justifiable in the way that constructivist
methodologists demand, but that we have reason to suppose that we shall
eventually learn that many of our present scientific conjectures are untrue.
Any conception that guides us more successfully than what we hitherto
believed may, moreover, although a great advance, be in substance as
mistaken as its predecessor. As we have learnt from Karl Popper
(1934/1959), our aim must be to make our successive mistakes as quickly as
possible. If we were meanwhile to abandon all present conjectures that we
cannot prove to be true, we would soon be back at the level of the savage
who trusts only his instincts. Yet this is what all versions of scientism have
advised - from Cartesian rationalism to modern positivism.

THE FATAL CONCEIT
appropriate also to the argument of the following section) one popular
way of attempting to justify morality, it should be noticed that there is
no point to assuming, as rationalist and hedonistic theories of ethics do,
that our morality is justified just to the extent, say, that it is directed
towards the production of, or striving after, some specific goal such as
happiness. There is no reason to suppose that the selection by evolution
of such habitual practices as enabled men to nourish larger numbers
had much if anything to do with the production of happiness, let alone
that it was guided by the striving after it. On the contrary, there is
much to indicate that those who aimed simply at happiness would have
been overwhelmed by those who just wanted to preserve their lives.
While our moral traditions cannot be constructed, justified or
demonstrated in the way demanded, their processes of formation can be
partially reconstructed, and in doing so we can to some degree
understand the needs that they serve. To the extent we succeed in this,
we are indeed called upon to improve and revise our moral traditions by
remedying recognisable defects by piecemeal improvement based on
i mmanent criticism (see Popper, 1945/66, and 1983:29-30), that is, by
analysing the compatibility and consistency of their parts, and tinkering
with the system accordingly.

As examples of such piecemeal improvement, we have mentioned new
contemporary studies of copyright and patents. To take another example,
much as we owe to the classical (Roman law) concept of several property as
the exclusive right to use or abuse a physical object in any manner we like, it
oversimplifies the rules required to maintain an efficient market economy,
and a whole new sub-discipline of economics is growing up, devoted to
ascertaining how the traditional institution of property can be improved to
make the market function better.

Moreover, while it is true that traditional morals, etc., are not
rationally justifiable, this is also true of any possible moral code, including
any that socialists might ever be able to come up with. Hence no matter what
rules we follow, we will not be able to justify them as demanded; so no
argument about morals - or science, or law, or language - can
legitimately turn on the issue of justification (see Bartley, 1962/1984;
1964, 1982). If we stopped doing everything for which we do not know
the reason, or for which we cannot provide a justification in the sense
demanded, we would probably very soon be dead.
The issue of justification is indeed a red herring, owing in part to
mistaken, and inconsistent, assumptions arising within our main
epistemological and methodological tradition which in some cases go
back to antiquity. Confusion about justification also stems, particularly
so far as the issues that mainly occupy us are concerned, from Auguste
Comte, who supposed that we were capable of remaking our moral
system as a whole, and replacing it by a completely constructed and
justified (or as Comte himself said, `demonstrated') body of rules.
I shall not state here all the reasons for the irrelevance of traditional
demands for justification. But just to take as an example (one

What is needed as a preliminary for such analyses includes what is
sometimes called a `rational reconstruction' (using the word 'construction' in a sense very different from 'constructivism') of how the system
might have come into being. This is in effect an historical, even naturalhistorical, investigation, not an attempt to construct, justify, or
demonstrate the system itself. It would resemble what followers of
Hume used to call `conjectural history', which tried to make intelligible
why some rules rather than others had prevailed (but never overlooked
Hume's basic contention, which cannot often enough be repeated, that
`the rules of morality are not the conclusions of our reason'). This is the
path taken not only by the Scottish philosophers but by a long chain of
students of cultural evolution, from the classical Roman grammarians
and linguists, to Bernard Mandeville, through Herder, Giambattista

68

69

THE FATAL CONCEIT

Vico (who had the profound insight that homo non intelligendo fit omnia
(' man became all he is without understanding it' (1854: V,183)), and
the German historians of law that we have mentioned, such as von
Savigny, and on to Carl Menger. Menger was the only one of these to
have come after Darwin, yet all attempted to provide a rational
reconstruction, conjectural history, or evolutionary account of the
emergence of cultural institutions.
At this point I find myself in the embarrassing position of wanting to
claim that it must be the members of my own profession, the
economists, specialists who understand the process of formation of
extended orders, who are most likely to be able to provide explanations
of those moral traditions that made the growth of civilisation possible.
Only someone who can account for effects such as those connected with
several property can explain why this type of practice enabled those
groups following it to outstrip others whose morals were better suited to
the achievement of different aims. But my desire to plead for my fellow
economists, while partly in order, would perhaps be more appropriate
were not so many of them themselves infected with constructivism.
How then do morals arise? What is our ` rational reconstruction'? We
have already sketched it in the foregoing chapters. Apart from the
constructivist contention that an adequate morality can be designed and
constructed afresh by reason, there are at least two other possible
sources of morality. There is, first, as we saw, the innate morality, socalled, of our instincts (solidarity, altruism, group decision, and such
like), the practices flowing from which are not sufficient to sustain our
present extended order and its population.
Second, there is the evolved morality (savings, several property,
honesty, and so on) that created and sustains the extended order. As we
have already seen, this morality stands between i nstinct and reason, a
position that has been obscured by the false dichotomy of instinct versus
reason.
The extended order depends on this morality in the sense that it came
i nto being through the fact that those groups following its underlying
rules increased in numbers and in wealth relative to other groups. The
paradox of our extended order, and of the market - and a stumbling
block for socialists and constructivists - is that, through this process, we
are able to sustain more from discoverable resources (and indeed in that
very process discover more resources) than would be possible by a
personally directed process. And although this morality is not justified'
by the fact that it enables us to do these things, and thereby to survive,
it does enable us to survive, and there is something perhaps to be said for that.

70

THE FATAL CONCEIT

The Limits of Guidance by Factual Knowledge; The Impossibility of Observing
the Effects of Our Morality

False assumptions about the possibility of justification, construction or
demonstration are perhaps at the root of scientism. But even if they
were to understand this, proponents of scientism would undoubtedly
want to fall back on the other requirements of their ancient
methodology, which are connected to, but are not strictly dependent on,
the demand for justification. For example (to hark back to our list of
requirements), it would be objected that one cannot fully understand
traditional morals and how they work; following them serves no purpose
that one can specify fully i n advance; following them produces effects that are
not immediately observable and hence cannot be determined to be beneficial - and
which are in any case not fully known or foreseen.
In other words, traditional morals do not conform to the second,
third, and fourth requirements. These requirements are, as noted, so
closely interrelated that one may, after marking their different
emphases, treat them together. Thus, briefly to indicate their interconnections, it would be said that one does not understand what one is
doing, or what one's purpose is, unless one knows and can specify fully
in advance the observable effects of one's action. Action, it is contended,
if it is to be rational, must be deliberate and foresighted.
Unless one were to interpret these requirements in so broad and
trivial a manner that they would lose all specific practical meaning - as
by saying that the understood purpose of the market order, for example,
is to produce the beneficial effect of `generating wealth' - following
traditional practices, such as those that generate the market order,
clearly does not meet these requirements. I do not believe that any
party to our discussion would wish to consider these requirements in so
trivial an interpretation; certainly they are not so intended either by
their proponents or their opponents. Consequently we may get a clearer
view of the situation in which we actually find ourselves by conceding
that, indeed, our traditional institutions are not understood, and do not
have their purposes or their effects, beneficial or otherwise, specified in
advance. And so much the better for them.
In the marketplace (as in other institutions of our extended order),
unintended consequences are paramount: a distribution of resources is
effected by an impersonal process in which individuals, acting for their
own ends (themselves also often rather vague), literally do not and
cannot know what will be the net result of their interactions.
Take the requirements that it is unreasonable to follow or do
anything blindly (i.e., without understanding) and that the purposes
and effects of a proposed action must not only be fully known in advance
71

THE FATAL CONCEIT

but also fully observable and maximally beneficial. Now apply these
requirements to the notion of an extended order. When we consider this
order in the vast evolutionary frame in which it developed, the
absurdity of the demands becomes evident. The decisive effects that led
to the creation of the order itself, and to certain practices predominating
over others, were exceedingly remote results of what earlier individuals
had done, results exerting themselves on groups of which earlier
individuals could hardly have been aware, and which effects, had earlier
individuals been able to know them, may not have appeared at all
beneficial to them, whatever later individuals may think. As for those
later individuals, there is no reason why all (or any) of them should be
endowed with a full knowledge of history, let alone of evolutionary
theory, economics, and everything else they would have to know, so as
to perceive why the group whose practices they follow should have
flourished more than others - although no doubt some persons are
always adept at inventing justifications of current or local practice.
Many of the evolved rules which secured greater cooperation and
prosperity for the extended order may have differed utterly from
anything that could have been anticipated, and might even seem
repugnant to someone or other, earlier or later in the evolution of that
order. In the extended order, the circumstances determining what each
must do to achieve his own ends include, conspicuously, unknown
decisions of many other unknown people about what means to use for
their own purposes. Hence, at no moment in the process could
individuals have designed, according to their purposes, the functions
of the rules that gradually did form the order; and only later,
and imperfectly and retrospectively, have we been able to begin
to explain these formations in principle (see Hayek, 1967, essays 1
and 2).

THE FATAL CONCEIT

There is no ready English or even German word that precisely
characterises an extended order, or how its way of functioning contrasts
with the rationalists' requirements. The only appropriate word,
`transcendent', has been so misused that I hesitate to use it. In its literal
meaning, however, it does concern that which far surpasses the reach of our
understanding, wishes and purposes, and our sense perceptions, and that which
incorporates and generates knowledge which no individual brain, or any
single organisation, could possess or invent. This is conspicuously so in
its religious meaning, as we see for example in the Lord's Prayer, where
it is asked that ' Thy will [i.e., not mine] be done in earth as it is in
heaven'; or in the Gospel, where it is declared: 'Ye have not chosen me
but I have chosen you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that
your fruit should remain' (St. John, 15:26). But a more purely

transcendent ordering, which also happens to be a purely naturalistic
ordering (not derived from any supernatural power), as for example in
evolution, abandons the animism still present in religion: the idea that a
single brain or will (as for example, that of an omniscient God) could
control and order.
The rejection of rationalistic requirements on grounds such as these
thus also has an important consequence for anthropomorphism and
animism of all sorts - and thus for socialism. If market coordination of
individual activities, as well as other moral traditions and institutions,
results from natural, spontaneous, and self-ordering processes of
adaptation to a greater number of particular facts than any one mind
can perceive or even conceive, it is evident that demands that these
processes be just, or possess other moral attributes (see chapter seven),
derive from a naive anthropomorphism. Such demands of course might
be appropriately addressed to the directors of a process guided by
rational control or to a god attentive to prayers, but are wholly
inappropriate to the impersonal self-ordering process actually at work.
In an order so extended as to transcend the comprehension and
possible guidance of any single mind, a unified will can indeed hardly
determine the welfare of its several members in terms of some particular
conception of justice, or according to an agreed scale. Nor is this due
merely to the problems of anthropomorphism. It is also because `welfare
. . . has no principle, neither for him who receives it, nor for him who
distributes it (one places it here, another there); because it depends on
the material content of the will, which is dependent on particular facts
and therefore is incapable of a general rule' (Kant, 1798:11, 6, note 2).
The insight that general rules must prevail for spontaneity to flourish,
as reaped by Hume and Kant, has never been refuted, merely neglected
or forgotten.
Although `welfare has no principle' - and hence cannot generate
spontaneous order - resistance to those rules of justice that made the
extended order possible, and denunciation of them as anti-moral, stem
from the belief that welfare must have a principle, and from refusal (and
here is where anthropomorphism reenters the picture) to accept that the
extended order arises out of a competitive process in which success
decides, not approval of a great mind, a committee, or a god, or
conformity with some understood principle of individual merit. In this
order the advance of some is paid for by the failure of equally sincere
and even meritorious endeavours of others. Reward is not for merit
(e.g., obedience to moral rules, cf. Hayek 1960:94). For instance, we may
fulfil the needs of others, regardless of their merit or the reason for our
ability to fulfil them. As Kant saw, no common standard of merit can
judge between different opportunities open to different individuals with

72

73

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE FATAL CONCEIT

different information, different abilities, and different desires. This latter
situation is indeed the usual one. Discoveries enabling some to prevail
are mostly unintended or unforeseen - by those who prevail as well as
by those who fail. The value of products resulting from necessary
changes of individual activities will rarely seem just since they are made
necessary by unforeseen events. Nor can the steps of a process of
evolution towards what was previously unknown appear just in the
sense of conforming to preconceptions of rightness and wrongness, of
` welfare', or of possibilities open in circumstances previously obtaining.
Understandable aversion to such morally blind results, results
inseparable from any process of trial-and-error, leads men to want to
achieve a contradiction in terms: namely, to wrest control of evolution i.e., of the procedure of trial and error - and to shape it to their present
wishes. But invented moralities resulting from this reaction give rise to
irreconcilable claims that no system can satisfy and which thus remain
the source of unceasing conflict. The fruitless attempt to render a situation
just whose outcome, by its nature, cannot be determined by what
anyone does or can know, only damages the functioning of the process
itself.
Such demands for justice are simply inappropriate to a naturalistic
evolutionary process - inappropriate not just to what has happened in
the past, but to what is going on at present. For of course this
evolutionary process is still at work. Civilisation is not only a product of
evolution - it is a process; by establishing a framework of general rules
and individual freedom it allows itself to continue to evolve. This
evolution cannot be guided by and often will not produce what men
demand. Men may find some previously unfulfilled wishes satisfied, but
only at the price of disappointing many others. Though by moral
conduct an individual may increase his opportunities, the resulting
evolution will not gratify all his moral desires. Evolution cannot be just.
Indeed, to insist that all future change be just would be to demand
that evolution come to a halt. Evolution leads us ahead precisely in
bringing about much that we could not intend or foresee, let alone
prejudge for its moral properties. One only need ask (particularly in
light of the historical account given in chapters two and three) what
would have been the effect if, at some earlier date, some magic force had
been granted the power to enforce, say, some egalitarian or meritocratic
creed. One soon recognises that such an event would have made the
evolution of civilisation impossible. A Rawlsian world (Rawls, 1971)
could thus never have become civilised: by repressing differentiation
due to luck, it would have scotched most discoveries of new possibilities.
In such a world we would be deprived of those signals that alone can
tell each what, as a result of thousands of changes in the conditions in

First, there is the question of how our knowledge really does arise. Most
knowledge - and I confess it took me some time to recognise this - is
obtained not from immediate experience or observation, but in the
continuous process of sifting a learnt tradition, which requires
individual recognition and following of moral traditions that are not
justifiable in terms of the canons of traditional theories of rationality.
The tradition is the product of a process of selection from among
irrational, or, rather, `unjustified' beliefs which, without anyone's
knowing or intending it, assisted the proliferation of those who followed
them (with no necessary relationship to the reasons - as for example
religious reasons - for which they were followed). The process of
selection that shaped customs and morality could take account of more
factual circumstances than individuals could perceive, and in consequence tradition is in some respects superior to, or `wiser' than, human
reason (see chapter one above). This decisive insight is one that only a
very critical rationalist could recognise.

74

75

which we live, we must now do in order to keep the stream of
production flowing and, if possible, increasing.
Intellectuals may of course claim to have invented new and better
`social' morals that will accomplish just this, but these `new' rules
represent a recidivism to the morals of the primitive micro-order, and
can hardly maintain the life and health of the billions supported by the
macro-order.
It is easy to understand anthropomorphism, even though we must reject
it for its mistakes. And this brings us back to the positive and
sympathetic aspect of the standpoint of the intellectuals whose views we
have contested. Man's inventiveness contributed so much to the
formation of super-individual structures within which individuals found
great opportunities that people came to imagine that they could
deliberately design the whole as well as some of its parts, and that the
mere existence of such extended structures shows that they can be
deliberately designed. Although this is an error, it is a noble one, one
that is, in Mises's words, `grandiose ... ambitious ... magnificent
. . . daring'.
Unspecified Purposes: In the Extended Order Most Ends of Action Are Not
Conscious or Deliberate

There are a number of distinct points and questions, mostly
elaborations of what has just been stated, that help make clearer how
these matters work together.

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE FATAL CONCEIT

To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of

deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions
order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively
by decentralising decisions, and that a division of authority will actually
extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralisation actually
leads to more information being taken into account. This is the main
reason for rejecting the requirements of constructivist rationalism. For the
same reason, only the alterable division of the power of disposal over
particular resources among many individuals actually able to decide on
their use - a division obtained through individual freedom and several
property - makes the fullest exploitation of dispersed knowledge possible.
Much of the particular information which any individual possesses
can be used only to the extent to which he himself can use it in his own
decisions. Nobody can communicate to another all that he knows,
because much of the information he can make use of he himself will
elicit only in the process of making plans for action. Such information
will be evoked as he works upon the particular task he has undertaken
in the conditions in which he finds himself, such as the relative scarcity
of various materials to which he has access. Only thus can the
individual find out what to look for, and what helps him to do this in
the market is the responses others make to what they find in their own
environments. The overall problem is not merely to make use of given
knowledge, but to discover as much information as is worth searching
for in prevailing conditions.
It is often objected that the institution of property is selfish in that it
benefits only those who own some, and that it was indeed `invented' by
some persons who, having acquired some individual possessions, wished
for their exclusive benefit to protect these from others. Such notions,
which of course underlie Rousseau's resentment, and his allegation that
our `shackles' have been imposed by selfish and exploitative interests,
fail to take into account that the size of our overall product is so large
only because we can, through market exchange of severally owned
property, use widely dispersed knowledge of particular facts to allocate
severally owned resources. The market is the only known method of
providing information enabling individuals to judge comparative
advantages of different uses of resources of which they have immediate
knowledge and through whose use, whether they so intend or not, they
serve the needs of distant unknown individuals. This dispersed
knowledge is essentially dispersed, and cannot possibly be gathered
together and conveyed to an authority charged with the task of
deliberately creating order.
Thus the institution of several property is not selfish, nor was it, nor
could it have been, `invented' to impose the will of property-owners
upon the rest. Rather, it is generally beneficial in that it transfers the

76

77

Second, and closely related to this, there is the question raised earlier of
what, in the evolutionary selection of rules of conduct, is really decisive.
The immediately perceived effects of actions that humans tend to
concentrate on are fairly unimportant to this selection; rather, selection
is made according to the consequences of the decisions guided by the
rules of conduct in the long run - the same long run sneered at by
Keynes (1971, C.W.:IV, 65). These consequences depend - as argued
above and discussed again below - chiefly on rules of property and
contract securing the personal domain of the individual. Hume had
already noticed this, writing that these rules `are not derived from any
utility or advantage which either the particular person or the public may
reap from his enjoyment of any particular good' (1739/1886:II, 273).
Men did not foresee the benefits of rules before adopting them, though
some people gradually have become aware of what they owe to the
whole system.
Our earlier claim, that acquired traditions serve as `adaptations to
the unknown', must then be taken literally. Adaptation to the unknown
is the key in all evolution, and the totality of events to which the
modern market order constantly adapts itself is indeed unknown to
anybody. The information that individuals or organisations can use to
adapt to the unknown is necessarily partial, and is conveyed by signals
(e.g., prices) through long chains of individuals, each person passing on
in modified form a combination of streams of abstract market signals.
Nonetheless, the whole structure of activities tends to adapt, through these partial
and fragmentary signals, to conditions foreseen by and known to no individual,

even if this adaptation is never perfect. That is why this structure
survives, and why those who use it also survive and prosper.
There can be no deliberately planned substitutes for such a selfordering process of adaptation to the unknown. Neither his reason nor
his innate `natural goodness' leads man this way, only the bitter
necessity of submitting to rules he does not like in order to maintain
himself against competing groups that had already begun to expand
because they stumbled upon such rules earlier.
If we had deliberately built, or were consciously shaping, the
structure of human action, we would merely have to ask individuals
why they had interacted with any particular structure. Whereas, in fact,
specialised students, even after generations of effort, find it exceedingly
difficult to explain such matters, and cannot agree on what are the
causes or what will be the effects of particular events. The curious task
of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about
what they imagine they can design.

THE FATAL CONCEIT

guidance of production from the hands of a few individuals who,
whatever they may pretend, have limited knowledge, to a process, the,
extended order, that makes maximum use of the knowledge of all,
thereby benefiting those who do not own property nearly as much as
those who do.
Nor does freedom of all under the law require that all be able to own
individual property but that many people do so. I myself should
certainly prefer to be without property in a land in which many others
own something, than to have to live where all property is `collectively
owned' and assigned by authority to particular uses.
But this argument too is challenged, even ridiculed, as the selfish
excuse of privileged classes. Intellectuals, thinking in terms of limited
causal processes they had learnt to interpret in areas such as physics,
found it easy to persuade manual workers that selfish decisions of
individual owners of capital - rather than the market process itself made use of widely dispersed opportunities and constantly changing
relevant facts. The whole process of calculating in terms of market
prices was, indeed, sometimes even represented as part of a devious
manoeuvre on the part of owners of capital to conceal how they
exploited workers. But such retorts quite fail to address the arguments
and facts already rehearsed: some hypothetical body of objective facts is no more

THE FATAL CONCEIT

A pre-formation of an order or pattern in a brain or mind is not only not a
superior but an inferior method of securing an order. For it must always be a
small part of the overall system in which some features of that larger system
can reflect themselves. As little as it is possible for the human brain ever
fully to explain itself (Hayek, 1952:8.66-8.86) is it possible for that brain to
account for, or predict, the result of the interaction of a large number of
human brains.
Fourth, there is the important point that an order arising from the separate
decisions of many individuals on the basis of different information cannot be
determined by a common scale of the relative importance of different ends. This

various persons in various ways, for instance by Gilbert Ryle in his
distinction between `knowing how' and `knowing that' (1945-46:1-16;
1949)). The habit of following rules of conduct is an ability utterly
different from the knowledge that one's actions will have certain kinds
of effects. This conduct ought to be seen for what it is, the skill to fit
oneself into, or align oneself with, a pattern of whose very existence one
may barely be aware and of whose ramifications one has scarcely any
knowledge. Most people can, after all, recognise and adapt themselves
to several different patterns of conduct without being able to explain or
describe them. How one responds to perceived events would thus by no
means necessarily be determined by knowledge of the effects of one's
own actions, for we often do not and cannot have such knowledge. If we
cannot have it, there is hardly anything rational about the demand that
we ought to have it; and indeed we should be the poorer if what we did
were guided solely by the limited knowledge that we do have of such
effects.

brings us close to the issue of marginal utility, an important matter that
we shall postpone discussing until chapter six. Here, however, it is
appropriate to discuss in a general way the advantages of the
differentiation that an extended order makes possible. Freedom involves
freedom to be different - to have one's own ends in one's own domain;
yet order everywhere, and not only in human affairs, also presupposes
differentiation of its elements. Such differentiation might be confined
merely to the local or temporal position of its elements, but an order
would hardly be of any interest unless the differences were greater than
this. Order is desirable not for keeping everything in place but for
generating new powers that would otherwise not exist. The degree of
orderliness - the new powers that order creates and confers - depends
more on the variety of the elements than on their temporal or local
position.
Illustrations are everywhere. Consider how genetic evolution
favoured the unique extension of the infancy and childhood of
humankind because that made possible extremely great diversity, and
thereby a great acceleration of cultural evolution and a quickening of
the increase of the species homo. Though biologically determined
differences among individual men are probably smaller than those of
some domesticated animals (especially dogs), this long learning period
after birth allows individuals more time to adapt themselves to
particular environments and to absorb the different streams of tradition
into which they are born. The varieties of skills that make division of
labour possible, and with it the extended order, are largely due to these
different streams of tradition, encouraged by underlying dissimilarities
in natural gifts and preferences. The whole of tradition is, moreover, so
incomparably more complex than what any individual mind can
command that it can be transmitted at all only if there are many
different individuals to absorb different portions of it. The advantage of
individual differentiation is all the greater in that it makes large groups
more efficient.

available to capitalists for manipulating the whole than it is to the managers that
the socialists would like to replace them. Such objective facts simply do not

exist and are unavailable to anyone.
Third, there is

a difference between following rules of conduct, on the one hand,
and knowledge about something, on the other (a difference pointed to by

THE FATAL CONCEIT

instinctual, and cautious; micro-ethic of the small band, wherein jointly
perceived purposes were directed to the visible needs of personally
known comrades (i.e., solidarity and altruism). Earlier I claimed that,
within an extended order, solidarity and altruism are possible only in a
li mited way within some sub-groups, and that to restrict the behaviour
of the group at large to such action would work against coordinating the

of its members. Once most of the productive activities of
members of a cooperating group transcend the range of the individual's
perception, the old impulse to follow inborn altruistic instincts actually
hinders the formation of more extensive orders.
In the sense of inculcating conduct that benefits others, all systems of
morality of course commend altruistic action; but the question is how to
accomplish this. Good intentions will not suffice - we all know what
road they pave. Guidance strictly by perceivable favourable effects on
particular other persons is insufficient for, and even irreconcilable with,
the extended order. The morals of the market do lead us to benefit
others, not by our intending to do so, but by making us act in a manner
which, nonetheless, will have just that effect. The extended order
circumvents individual ignorance (and thus also adapts us to the
unknown, as discussed above) in a way that good intentions alone
cannot do - and thereby does make our efforts altruistic in their effects.
In an order taking advantage of the higher productivity of extensive
division of labour, the individual can no longer know whose needs his
efforts do or ought to serve, or what will be the effects of his actions on
those unknown persons who do consume his products or products to
which he has contributed. Directing his productive efforts altruistically
thus becomes literally impossible for him. In so far as we can still call
his motives altruistic in that they eventually redound to the benefit of
others, they will do this not because he aims at or intends to serve the
concrete needs of others, but because he observes abstract rules. Our
` altruism', in this new sense, is very different from instinctual altruism.
No longer the end pursued but the rules observed make the action good
or bad. Observing these rules, while bending most of our efforts towards
earning a living, enables us to confer benefits beyond the range of our
concrete knowledge (yet at the same time hardly prevents us from using
whatever extra we earn also to gratify our instinctive longing to do
visible good). All this is obscured by the systematic abuse of the term
` altruistic' by sociobiologists.
Another explanation for the demand that one's actions be restricted
to the deliberate pursuit of known beneficial ends may also be
mentioned. The demand arises not only from archaic and uninstructed
instinct but also from a characteristic peculiar to those intellectuals who
champion it - an entirely understandable characteristic which nonetheless remains self-defeating. Intellectuals are especially anxious to know
for what ultimate purpose what they themselves call their `brain
children' will be used, and thus passionately concern themselves with
the fate of their ideas, and hesitate much more to release thoughts from
their control than do manual workers their material products. This
reaction often makes such highly educated people reluctant to integrate

80

Thus, differences among individuals increase the power of the
collaborating group beyond the sum of individual efforts. Synergetic
collaboration brings into play distinctive talents that would have been
left unused had their possessors been forced to strive alone for
sustenance. Specialisation releases and encourages the development of a
few individuals whose distinctive contributions may suffice to provide
them a living or even to exceed the contributions others make to the
total. Civilisation is, in the famous phrase of Wilhelm von Humboldt
which Stuart Mill placed on the title page of his essay On Liberty, based
on `human development in its richest diversity'.
The knowledge that plays probably the chief role in this differentiation far from being the knowledge of any one human being, let alone that of
a directing superbrain - arises in a process of experimental interaction
of widely dispersed, different and even conflicting beliefs of millions of
communicating individuals. The increasing intelligence shown by man
is, accordingly, due not so much to increases in the several knowledge of
individuals but to procedures for combining different and scattered
i nformation which, in turn, generate order and enhance productivity.
Thus the development of variety is an important part of cultural
evolution, and a great part of an individual's value to others is due to
his differences from them. The importance and value of order will grow
with the variety of the elements, while greater order in turn enhances
the value of variety, and thus the order of human cooperation becomes
indefinitely extensible. If things were otherwise, if for example all men
were alike and could not make themselves different from one another,
there would be little point in division of labour (except perhaps among
people in different localities), little advantage from coordinating efforts,
and little prospect of creating order of any power or magnitude.
Thus individuals had to become different before they could be free to
combine into complex structures of cooperation. Moreover, they had to
combine into entities of a distinct character: not merely a sum but a
structure in some manner analogous to, and in some important respects
differing from, an organism.
Fifth, there is the question

whence then, in the presence of all these difficulties
and objections, the demand to restrict one's action to the deliberate pursuit of known
and observable beneficial ends arises. It is in part a remnant of the

efforts

THE FATAL CONCEIT

themselves into the exchange processes, processes that involve working
for unperceivable ends in a situation where the only identifiable result of
their efforts, if any, may indeed be someone else's profit. The manual
worker readily assumes that it is indeed his employer's job to know, if
anyone does, what needs the work of his hands will ultimately satisfy.
But the place of individual intellectual work in the product of many
intellectuals interacting in a chain of services or ideas will be less
identifiable. That better educated people should be more reluctant to
submit to some unintelligible direction - such as the market (despite
their talk of the `marketplace of ideas') - thus has the result (also
unintended) that they tend to resist just what (without their
understanding it) would increase their usefulness to their fellows.
This reluctance helps further to explain the hostility intellectuals bear
towards the market order, and something of their susceptibility to
socialism. Perhaps this hostility and susceptibility would diminish if
such persons understood better the role that abstract and spontaneous
ordering patterns play in all of life, as they no doubt would do if better
informed of evolution, biology, and economics. But when confronted by
information in these fields, they often are reluctant to listen, or even to
consider conceding the existence of complex entities of whose working
our minds can have only abstract knowledge. For mere abstract
knowledge of the general structure of such entities is insufficient to
enable us literally to `build' them (that is, to put them together from
known pieces), or to predict the particular form they will assume. At
best, it can indicate under what general conditions many such orders or
systems will form themselves, conditions that we may sometimes be able
to create. This sort of problem is familiar to the chemist concerned with
similarly complex phenomena but usually unfamiliar to the kind of
scientist accustomed to explaining everything in terms of simple
connections between a few observable events. The result is that such
persons are tempted to interpret more complex structures animistically
as the result of design, and to suspect some secret and dishonest
manipulation - some conspiracy, as of a dominant `class' - behind
` designs' whose designers are nowhere to be found. This in turn helps to
reinforce their initial reluctance to relinquish control of their own
products in a market order. For intellectuals generally, the feeling of
being mere tools of concealed, even if i mpersonal, market forces appears
almost as a personal humiliation.
It evidently has not occurred to them that the capitalists who are
suspected of directing it all are actually also tools of an impersonal
process, just as unaware of the ultimate effects and purpose of their
actions, but merely concerned with a higher level, and therefore a wider
range, of events in the whole structure. Moreover, the idea that the

question whether their own ends are satisfied should depend on the
activities of such men - men concerned solely with means - is itself an
abomination to them.

The Ordering of the Unknown

The English language unfortunately lacks a popular word available in
German: namely, Machbarkeit. I sometimes wonder whether a good
cause might not be served by coining an equivalent English term
`makeability' - 'manufacturability' does not quite do (and my own
`constructivism' could hardly be rendered by 'constructible') - to
describe the view that we have confronted, examined and contested
throughout this chapter and the last: namely, that anything produced
by evolution could have been done better by the use of human
ingenuity.
This view is untenable. For in fact we are able to bring about an
ordering of the unknown only by causing it to order itself In dealing with
our physical surroundings we sometimes can indeed achieve our ends
by relying on the self-ordering forces of nature, but not by deliberately
trying to arrange elements in the order that we wish them to assume.
This is for example what we do when we initiate processes that produce
crystals or new chemical substances (see previous section and also
Appendix C). In chemistry, and even more in biology, we must use selfordering processes in an increasing measure; we can create the
conditions under which they will operate, but we cannot determine
what will happen to any particular element. Most synthetic chemical
compounds are not 'constructible' in the sense that we can create them
by placing the individual elements composing them in the appropriate
places. All we can do is to induce their formation.
A similar procedure must be followed to initiate processes that will
coordinate individual actions transcending our observation. In order to
induce the self-formation of certain abstract structures of inter-personal
relations, we need to secure the assistance of some very general
conditions, and then allow each individual element to find its own place
within the larger order. The most we can do to assist the process is to
admit only such elements as obey the required rules. This limitation of
our powers necessarily grows with the complexity of the structure that
we wish to bring into being.
An individual who finds himself at some point in an extended order
where only his immediate environment is known to him can apply this
advice to his own situation. He may need to start by trying continuously
to probe beyond the limits of what he can see, in order to establish and
maintain the communication that creates and sustains the overall order.

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE FATAL CONCEIT

Indeed, maintaining communication within the order requires that
dispersed information be utilised by many different individuals,
unknown to one another, in a way that allows the different knowledge of
millions to form an exosomatic or material pattern. Every individual
becomes a link in many chains of transmission through which he
receives signals enabling him to adapt his plans to circumstances he
does not know. The overall order thus becomes infinitely expansible,
spontaneously supplying information about an increasing range of
means without exclusively serving particular ends.

intervention to, say, flatten out inequalities in the interest of a random
member of the order risks damaging the working of the whole, the selfordering process will secure for any random member of such a group a
better chance over a wider range of opportunities available to all than
any rival system could offer.
How What Cannot Be Known Cannot Be Planned

Some persons are so troubled by some effects of the market order that
they overlook how unlikely and even wonderful it is to find such an
order prevailing in the greater part of the modern world, a world in
which we find thousands of millions of people working in a constantly
changing environment, providing means of subsistence for others who
are mostly unknown to them, and at the same time finding satisfied
their own expectations that they themselves will receive goods and
services produced by equally unknown people. Even in the worst of
times something like nine out of ten of them will find these expectations
confirmed.
Such an order, although far from perfect and often inefficient, can
extend farther than any order men could create by deliberately putting
countless elements into selected `appropriate' places. Most defects and
i nefficiencies of such spontaneous orders result from attempting to
interfere with or to prevent their mechanisms from operating, or to
i mprove the details of their results. Such attempts to intervene in
spontaneous order rarely result in anything closely corresponding to
men's wishes, since these orders are determined by more particular facts
than any such intervening agency can know. Yet, while deliberate

Where has the discussion of our last two chapters brought us? The
doubts Rousseau cast on the institution of several property became the
foundation of socialism and have continued to influence some of the
greatest thinkers of our century. Even as great a figure as Bertrand
Russell defined liberty as the `absence of obstacles to the realisation of
our desires' (1940:251). At least before the obvious economic failure of
Eastern European socialism, it was widely thought by such rationalists
that a centrally planned economy would deliver not only `social justice'
(see chapter seven below), but also a more efficient use of economic
resources. This notion appears eminently sensible at first glance. But it
proves to overlook the facts just reviewed: that the totality of resources
that one could employ in such a plan is simply not knowable to anybody, and
therefore can hardly be centrally controlled.
Nonetheless, socialists continue to fail to face the obstacles in the way
of fitting separate individual decisions into a common pattern conceived
as a `plan'. The conflict between our instincts, which, since Rousseau,
have become identified with `morality', and the moral traditions that
have survived cultural evolution and serve to restrain these instincts, is
embodied in the separation now often drawn between certain sorts of
ethical and political philosophy on the one hand and economics on the
other. The point is not that whatever economists determine to be
efficient is therefore `right', but that economic analysis can elucidate the
usefulness of practices heretofore thought to be right - usefulness from
the perspective of any philosophy that looks unfavourably on the human
suffering and death that would follow the collapse of our civilisation. It
is a betrayal of concern for others, then, to theorise about the 'just
society' without carefully considering the economic consequences of
implementing such views. Yet, after seventy years of experience with
socialism, it is safe to say that most intellectuals outside the areas Eastern Europe and the Third World - where socialism has been tried
remain content to brush aside what lessons might lie in economics,
unwilling to wonder whether there might not be a reason why socialism,
as often as it is attempted, never seems to work out as its intellectual
leaders intended. The intellectuals' vain search for a truly socialist
community, which results in the idealisation of, and then disillusion-

Earlier, we considered some important aspects of such processes of
communication, including the market with its necessary and continual
variation of prices. Here it need only be added and stressed that,
beyond regulating current production of commodities and supplies of
services, the same traditions and practices also provide for the future;
their effects will manifest themselves not only as an interlocal order, but
also as an intertemporal one. Actions will be adapted not only to others
distant in space but also to events beyond the life expectancies of acting
individuals. Only a confessed immoralist could indeed defend measures
of policy on the grounds that `in the long run we are all dead'. For the
only groups to have spread and developed are those among whom it
became customary to try to provide for children and later descendants
whom one might never see.

THE FATAL CONCEIT

ment with, a seemingly endless string of `utopias' - the Soviet Union,
then Cuba, China, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Tanzania, Nicaragua - should
suggest that there might be something about socialism that does not
conform to certain facts. But such facts, first explained by economists
more than a century ago, remain unexamined by those who pride
themselves on their rationalistic rejection of the notion that there could
be any facts that transcend historical context or present an insurmountable barrier to human desires.
Meanwhile, among those who, in the tradition of Mandeville, Hume,
and Smith, did study economics, there gradually emerged not only an
understanding of market processes, but a powerful critique of the
possibility of substituting socialism for them. The advantages of these
market procedures were so contrary to expectation that they could be
explained only retrospectively, through analysing this spontaneous
formation itself. When this was done, it was found that decentralised
control over resources, control through several property, leads to the
generation and use of more information than is possible under central
direction. Order and control extending beyond the immediate purview
of any central authority could be attained by central direction only if,
contrary to fact, those local managers who could gauge visible and
potential resources were also currently informed of the constantly
changing relative importance of such resources, and could then
communicate full and accurate details about this to some central
planning authority in time for it to tell them what to do in the light of
all the other, different, concrete information it had received from other
regional or local managers - who of course, in turn, found themselves in
similar difficulties in obtaining and delivering any such information.
Once we realise what the task of such a central planning authority
would be, it becomes clear that the commands it would have to issue
could not be derived from the information the local managers had
recognised as important, but could only be determined through direct
dealings among individuals or groups controlling clearly delimited
aggregates of means. The hypothetical assumption, customarily employed in theoretical descriptions of the market process (descriptions
made by people who usually have no intention of supporting socialism),
to the effect that all such facts (or `parameters') can be assumed to be
known to the explaining theorist, obscures all this, and consequently
produces the curious deceptions that help to sustain various forms of
socialist thinking.
The order of the extended economy is, and can be, formed only by a
wholly different process - from an evolved method of communication
that makes it possible to transmit, not an infinite multiplicity of reports
about particular facts, but merely certain abstract properties of several
particular conditions, such as competitive prices, which must be

brought into mutual correspondence to achieve overall order. These
communicate the different rates of substitution or equivalence that the
several parties involved find prevailing between the various goods and
services whose use they command. Certain quantities of any such
objects may prove to be equivalents or possible substitutes for one
another, either for satisfying particular human needs or for producing,
directly or indirectly, means to satisfy them. Surprising as it may be
that such a process exists at all, let alone that it came into being
through evolutionary selection without being deliberately designed, I
know of no efforts to refute this contention or discredit the process itself
- unless one so regards simple declarations that all such facts can,
somehow, be known to some central planning authority. (See also, in
this connection, the discussion of economic calculation, in Babbage
(1832), Gossen (1854/1889/1927), Pierson (1902/1912), Mises
(1922/81), Hayek (1935), Rutland (1985), Roberts (1971).)
Indeed the whole idea of `central control' is confused. There is not,
and never could be, a single directing mind at work; there will always
be some council or committee charged with designing a plan of action
for some enterprise. Though individual members may occasionally, to
convince the others, quote particular pieces of information that have
influenced their views, the conclusions of the body will generally not be
based on common knowledge but on agreement among several views
based on different information. Each bit of knowledge contributed by
one person will tend to lead some other to recall yet other facts of whose
relevance he has become aware only by his being told of yet other
circumstances of which he did not know. Such a process thus remains
one of making use of dispersed knowledge (and thus simulates trading,
although in a highly inefficient way - a way usually lacking competition
and diminished in accountability), rather than unifying the knowledge
of a number of persons. The members of the group will be able to
communicate to one another few of their distinct reasons; they will
communicate chiefly conclusions drawn from their respective individual
knowledge of the problem in hand. Moreover, only rarely will
circumstances really be the same for different persons contemplating the
same situation - at least in so far as this concerns some sector of the
extended order and not merely a more or less self-contained group.
Perhaps the best illustration of the impossibility of deliberate
`rational' allocation of resources in an extended economic order without
the guidance by prices formed in competitive markets is the problem of
allocating the current supply of liquid capital among all the different
uses whereby it could increase the final product. The problem is
essentially how much of the currently accruing productive resources can
be spared to provide for the more distant future as against present
needs. Adam Smith was aware of the representative character of this

86

97

SIX

THE FATAL CONCEIT

issue when, referring to the problem faced by an individual owner of
such capital, he wrote: `What is the species of domestick industry which
his capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the
greatest value, every individual, it is evident, can, in his local situation,
judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him'
(1776/1976).
If we consider the problem of the use of all means available for investment in
an extended economic system under a single directing authority, the first
difficulty is that no such determinate aggregate quantity of capital available
for current use can be known to anyone, although of course this quantity is
li mited in the sense that the effect of investing either more or less than it
must lead to discrepancies between the demand for various kinds of goods
and services. Such discrepancies will not be self-correcting but will manifest
themselves through some of the instructions given by the directing authority
proving to be impossible of execution, either because some of the goods
required will not be there or because some materials or instruments provided
cannot be used due to the lack of required complementary means (tools,
materials, or labour). None of the magnitudes that would have to be taken
into account could be ascertained by inspecting or measuring any `given'
objects, but all will depend on possibilities among which other persons will
have to choose in the light of knowledge that they possess at the time. An
approximate solution of this task will become possible only by the interplay
of those who can ascertain particular circumstances which the conditions of
the moment show, through their effects on market prices, to be relevant. The
` quantity of capital' available then proves, for example, what happens when
the share of current resources used to provide for needs in the more distant
future is greater than what people are prepared to spare from current
consumption in order to increase provision for that future, i.e., their
willingness to save.

THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF TRADE
AND MONEY

Disdain for the Commercial

Comprehending the role played by the transmission of information
(or of factual knowledge) opens the door to understanding the extended
order. Yet these issues are highly abstract, and are particularly hard to
grasp for those schooled in the mechanistic, scientistic, constructivist
canons of rationality that dominate our educational systems - and who
consequently tend to be ignorant of biology, economics, and evolution. I
confess that it took me too a long time from my first breakthrough, in
my essay on `Economics and Knowledge' (1936/48), through the
recognition of `Competition as a Discovery Procedure' (1978:179-190),
and my essay on `The Pretence of Knowledge' (1978:23-34), to state my
theory of the dispersal of information, from which follows my
conclusions about the superiority of spontaneous formations to central
direction.

Not all antipathy to the market order arises from questions of
epistemology, methodology, rationality and science. There is a further,
darker, dislike. To understand it, we must step behind these relatively
rational areas to something more archaic and even arcane: to attitudes
and emotions that arise especially powerfully when commercial activity,
trade and financial institutions are discussed by socialists - or
encountered by primitives.
As we have seen, trade and commerce often depend importantly on
confidentiality, as well as on specialised or individual knowledge; and
this is even more so of financial institutions. In commercial activities,
for example, more is at risk than one's own time and effort, and special
information enables individuals to judge their chances, their competitive
edge, in particular ventures. Knowledge of special circumstances is only
worth striving for if its possession confers some advantage compensating
for the cost of acquiring it. If every trader had to make public how and
where to obtain better or cheaper wares, so that all his competitors
could at once imitate' him, it would hardly be worth his while to engage
in the process at all - and the benefits accruing from trade would never
arise. Moreover, so much knowledge of particular circumstances is
unarticulated, and hardly even articulable (for example, an entrepreneur's hunch that a new product might be successful) that it would prove
i mpossible to make it `public' quite apart from considerations of
motivation.
Of course action in accordance with what is not perceived by all and
fully specified in advance - what Ernst Mach called the `observable and
tangible' - violates the rationalist requirements discussed earlier.
Moreover, what is intangible is also often an object of distrust and even
fear. (It may be mentioned in passing that not only socialists fear (if for
somewhat different reasons) the circumstances and conditions of trade.
Bernard Mandeville `shuddered' when confronted by `the most frightful
prospect [which] is left behind when we reflect on the toil and hazard
that are undergone abroad, the vast seas we are to go over, the different

climates we are to endure, and the several nations we must be obliged
to for their assistance' (1715/1924:1, 356). To become aware that we
depend heavily on human efforts that we cannot know about or control
is indeed unnerving - to those who engage in them as well as those who
would refrain.)
Such distrust and fear have, since antiquity and in many parts of the
world, led ordinary people as well as socialist thinkers to regard trade
not only as distinct from material production, not only as chaotic and
superfluous in itself, not only as a methodological mistake, as it were,
but also as suspicious, inferior, dishonest, and contemptible. Throughout history `merchants were objects of very general disdain and moral
opprobrium ... a man who bought cheap and sold dear was
fundamentally dishonest.... Merchant behaviour violated patterns of
mutuality that prevailed within primary groupings' (McNeill, 1981:35).
As I recall Eric Hoffer once remarking: `The hostility, in particular of
the scribe, towards the merchant is as old as recorded history'.
There are many reasons for such attitudes, and many forms in which
they express themselves. Often, in early days, traders were set apart
from the rest of the community. Nor was this so only of them. Even
some handiworkers, especially blacksmiths, suspected of sorcery by
tillers of the soil and herdsmen, were often kept outside the village.
After all, did not the smiths, with their `mysteries', transform material
substances? But this was so to a far higher degree of traders and
merchants, who partook in a network wholly outside the perception and
understanding of ordinary people. They engaged in something like the
transformation of the non-material in altering the value of goods. How
could the power of things to satisfy human needs change without a
change in their quantity? The trader or merchant, the one who seemed
to effect such changes, standing outside the seen, agreed and understood
order of daily affairs, also was thrust outside the established hierarchy
of status and respect. So it was that traders were held in contempt even
by Plato and Aristotle, citizens of a city which in their day owed her
leading position to trade. Later, under feudal conditions, commercial
pursuits continued to be held in relatively low esteem, for traders and
craftsmen, at least outside a few small towns, then depended for security
of life and limb, as well as of goods, on those who wielded the sword
and, with it, protected the roads. Trade could develop only under the
protection of a class whose profession was arms, whose members
depended on their physical prowess, and who claimed in return high
status and a high standard of life. Such attitudes, even when conditions
began to change, tended to linger wherever feudalism persisted, or was
unopposed by a wealthy bourgeoisie or trading centres in self-governing
towns. Thus, even as late as the end of the last century, we are told of

that `the makers of money were almost a class of untouchables'.
J apan
The ostracism of traders becomes even more understandable when it

is remembered that merchant activity is indeed often cloaked in
mystery. `The mysteries of the trades' meant that some gained from
knowledge that others lacked, a knowledge the more mysterious in that
it often dealt with foreign - and perhaps even disgusting - customs, as
well as unknown lands: lands of legend and rumour. `Ex nihilo nihil fit'
may no longer be part of science (see Popper, 1977/84:14; and Bartley,
1978:675-76), but it still dominates common sense. Activities that
appear to add to available wealth, `out of nothing', without physical
creation and by merely rearranging what already exists, stink of sorcery.
A neglected influence reinforcing such prejudices has to do with
physical effort, muscular activity, and the `sweat of one's brows'.
Physical strength, and the ordinary tools and weapons that often
accompany its employment, are not only observable but tangible. There
is nothing mysterious about them, even for most people who lack them
themselves. The conviction that physical effort, and the capacity for it,
are in themselves meritorious and confer rank hardly had to wait for
feudal times. It was part of the inherited instinct of the small group, and
was preserved among farmers, tillers of the soil, herdsmen, warriors,
and even simple householders and handicraftsmen. People could see
how the physical effort of the farmer or artisan added to the total of
visible useful things - and account for differences of wealth and power
in terms of recognisable causes.
Thus physical competition was introduced and appreciated early, as
primitive man became familiar, both in competition for leadership and
in games of skill (see Appendix E), with ways of testing visible
superiority of strength. But as soon as knowledge - which was not
` open' or visible - was introduced as an element in competition,
knowledge not possessed by other participants, and which must have
seemed to many of them also to be beyond the possibility of possession,
the familiarity and sense of fairness vanished. Such competition
threatened solidarity and the pursuit of agreed purposes. Viewed from
the perspective of the extended order, of course, such a reaction must
appear quite selfish, or perhaps as a curious kind of group egotism in
which the solidarity of the group outweighs the welfare of its
individuals.
Such sentiment was still vigorous in the nineteenth century. Thus,
when Thomas Carlyle, who had great influence among the literati of the
last century, preached that `work alone is noble' (1909:160), he
explicitly meant physical, even muscular, effort. To him, as to Karl
Marx, labour was the real source of wealth. This particular sentiment
may today be waning. Indeed, the connection of productivity with

THE FATAL CONCEIT
human physical prowess, though still valued by our instincts, plays an
ever smaller role in human endeavour, wherein power now less often
means physical might as legal right. Of course we can still not do
without some very strong individuals, but they are becoming merely one
kind of an increasing number of ever smaller groups of specialists. Only
among primitives do the physically strong still dominate.
However this may be, activities such as barter and exchange and
more elaborate forms of trade, the organisation or direction of activities,
and the shifting about of available goods for sale in accordance with
profitability, are still not always even regarded as real work. It remains
hard for many to accept that quantitative increases of available supplies
of physical means of subsistence and enjoyment should depend less on
the visible transformation of physical substances into other physical
substances than on the shifting about of objects which thereby change
their relevant magnitudes and values. That is, the market process deals
with material objects, but its shifting around of them does not seem to
add (whatever might be claimed or really be so) to their perceptible
quantities. The market transmits information about them rather than
producing them, and the crucial function played by the conveying of
i nformation escapes the notice of persons guided by mechanistic or
scientistic habits who take for granted factual information about
physical objects and disregard the role played, in the determination of
value, by the relative scarcity of different kinds of objects.
There is an irony here: that precisely those who do not think of economic
events in literally materialistic terms - that is, in terms of physical quantities
of material substances - but are guided by calculations in terms of value,
i.e., by the appreciation that men have for these objects, and particularly
those differences between costs and price that are called profits, should
habitually be denounced as materialists. Whereas it is precisely the striving
for profit that makes it possible for those engaged in it not to think in terms
of material quantities of particular concrete needs of known individuals, but
of the best way in which they can contribute to an aggregate output that
results from the similar separate efforts of countless unknown others.
There is also an error in economics here - an idea that even Carl
Menger's brother Anton propagated, the notion that the `whole product of
labour' stems mainly from physical effort; and although this is an old
mistake, it is probably John Stuart Mill as much as anyone who is
responsible for spreading it. Mill wrote in his Principles of Political Economy
(1848, ` Of Property', Book II, ch. I, sect. 1; Works, 11:260) that while `the
laws and the conditions of the production of wealth partake of the character
of physical truths', distribution is `a matter of human institutions only. The
things once there, mankind individually or collectively can do with them as
92

THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF TRADE AND MONEY
they like', from which he concluded that `society can subject this distribution
of wealth to whatever rules it can think out'. Mill, who is here considering
the size of the product as a purely technological problem, independent of its
distribution, overlooks the dependence of size on the use made of existing
opportunities, which is an economic and not a technological problem. We
owe it to methods of `distribution', that is, to the determination of prices,
that the product is as large as it is. What there is to share depends on the
principle by which production is organised - that is, in a market economy,
on pricing and distribution. It is simply wrong to conclude that `the things
once there', we are free to do with them as we like, for they will not be there
unless individuals have generated price information by securing for
themselves certain shares of the total.
There is a further error. Like Marx, Mill treated market values exclusively
as effects and not also as causes of human decisions. We shall see later, when
we turn to discuss marginal utility theory explicitly, how inaccurate this is and how wrong was Mill's declaration that `there is nothing in the laws of
value which remains for the present or any future writer to clear up; the
theory of the subject is complete' (1848:111, I, sect. 1, in Works, 11: 199-200).
Trade - regarded as real work or not - brought not only individual
but also collective wealth through effort of brain rather than of muscles.
That a mere change of hands should lead to a gain in value to all
participants, that it need not mean gain to one at the expense of the
others (or what has come to be called exploitation), was and is
nonetheless intuitively difficult to grasp. The example of Henry Ford is
sometimes brought forward to allay suspicions, to illustrate how striving
for profit benefits the masses. The example is indeed illuminating
because in it one does easily see how an entrepreneur could directly aim
at satisfying an observable need of large numbers of people, and how his
efforts did in fact succeed in raising their standard of living. But the
example is also insufficient; for in most cases the effects of increases of
productivity are too indirect to trace them so plainly. An improvement
in, say, the production of metal screws, or string, or window glass, or
paper, would spread its benefits so widely that far less concrete
perception of causes and effects would remain.
As a consequence of all these circumstances, many people continue to
find the mental feats associated with trade easy to discount even when
they do not attribute them to sorcery, or see them as depending on trick
or fraud or cunning deceit. Wealth so obtained appeared even less
related to any visible desert (i.e., desert dependent on physical exertion)
than did the luck of the hunter or fisher.
But if wealth generated by such `rearrangements' bewildered folk, the
information-searching activities of tradesmen evoked truly great dis93

THE FATAL CONCEIT

trust. The transport involved in trade can usually be at least partly
understood by the layman, at least after some patient explanation and
argument, to be productive. For example, the view that trade only shifts
about already existing things can be readily corrected by pointing out
that many things can be made only by assembling substances from
widely distant places. The relative value of these substances will depend
not on the attributes of the individual material components of which
they consist but on relative quantities available together at the locations
required. Thus trade in raw materials and semi-finished products is a
precondition for increase in the physical quantities of many final
products that could only be manufactured at all thanks to the
availability of (perhaps small quantities of) materials fetched from far
away. The quantity of a particular product that can be produced from
resources found at a particular place may depend on the availability of
a very much smaller quantity of another substance (such as mercury or
phosphor, or perhaps even a catalyst) that can be obtained only at the
other end of the earth. Trade thus creates the very possibility of
physical production.
The idea that such productivity, and even such bringing together of
supplies, also depends on a continuous successful search for widely
dispersed and constantly changing information remains harder to grasp,
however obvious it may seem to those who have understood the process
by which trade creates and guides physical production when steered by
i nformation about the relative scarcity of different things at different
places.
Perhaps the main force behind the persistent dislike of commercial
dealings is then no more than plain ignorance and conceptual difficulty.
This is however compounded with preexisting fear of the unfamiliar: a
fear of sorcery and the unnatural, and also a fear of knowledge itself
harking back to our origins and indelibly memorialised in the first few
chapters of the book of Genesis, in the story of man's expulsion from the
Garden of Eden. All superstitions, including socialism, feed on such fear.

THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF TRADE AND MONEY

The fear may be powerful, but it is unfounded. Such activities are of
course not really incomprehensible. Economics and the biological
sciences, as we have seen in the foregoing chapters, now give a good
account of self-organising processes, and we have sketched a partial
rational reconstruction of some of their history and beneficial effects in
the rise and spread of civilisation in chapters two and three above (see
also Hayek, 1973).

Exchange is productive; it does increase the satisfaction of human
needs from available resources. Civilisation is so complex - and trade so
productive - because the subjective worlds of the individuals living in
the civilised world differ so much. Apparently paradoxically, diversity of
individual purposes leads to a greater power to satisfy needs generally
than does homogeneity, unanimity and control - and, also paradoxically, this is so because diversity enables men to master and dispose of
more information. Only a clear analysis of the market process can resolve
these apparent paradoxes.
An increase of value - crucial in exchange and trade - is indeed
different from increases in quantity observable by our senses. Increase
in value is something for which laws governing physical events, at least
as understood within materialist and mechanistic models, do not
account. Value indicates the potential capacities of an object or action
to satisfy human needs, and can be ascertained only by the mutual
adjustment through exchange of the respective (marginal) rates of
substitution (or equivalence) which different goods or services have for
various individuals. Value is not an attribute or physical property
possessed by things themselves, irrespective of their relations to men,
but solely an aspect of these relations that enables men to take account,
in their decisions about the use of such things, of the better
opportunities others might have for their use. Increase in value appears
only with, and is relevant only with regard to, human purposes. As Carl
Menger made clear (1871/1981:121), value `is a judgement economising
men make about the importance of goods at their disposal for the
maintenance of their lives and well-being'. Economic value expresses
changing degrees of the capacity of things to satisfy some of the
multiplicity of separate, individual scales of ends.
Each person has his own peculiar order for ranking the ends that he
pursues. These individual rankings can be known to few, if any, others,
and are hardly known fully even by the person himself. The efforts of
millions of individuals in different situations, with different possessions
and desires, having access to different information about means,
knowing little or nothing about one another's particular needs, and
aiming at different scales of ends, are coordinated by means of exchange
systems. As individuals reciprocally align with one another, an
undesigned system of a higher order of complexity comes into being,
and a continuous flow of goods and services is created that, for a
remarkably high number of the participating individuals, fulfils their
guiding expectations and values.
The multiplicity of different ranks of different ends produces a
common, and uniform, scale of intermediate or reflected values of the
material means for which these ends compete. Since most material

94

95

Marginal Utility versus Macro-economics

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF TRADE AND MONEY

means can be used for many different ends of varying importance, and
diverse means can often be substituted for one another, the ultimate
values of the ends come to be reflected in a single scale of values of
means - i.e., prices - that depends on their relative scarcity and the
possibility of exchange among their owners.
Since changing factual circumstances require constant adaptation of
particular ends to whose service particular kinds of means must be
assigned, the two sets of scales of value are bound to change in different
manners and at different rates. The several orders of ranking of
individual ultimate ends, while different, will show a certain stability,
but the relative values of the means toward whose production those
individuals' efforts are directed will be subject to continuous fortuitous
fluctuations that cannot be anticipated and whose causes will be
unintelligible to most people.
That the hierarchy of ends is relatively stable (reflecting what many
may regard as their constant or `lasting' value), whereas the hierarchy
of means fluctuates so much, leads many idealistic persons to prize the
former and disdain the latter. To serve a constantly changing scale of
values may indeed seem repulsive. This is perhaps the fundamental
reason why those most concerned about ultimate ends nonetheless
often, contrary to their own objectives, attempt to thwart the procedure
by which they can best contribute to their realisation. Most people
must, to achieve their own ends, pursue what are merely means for
themselves as well as for others. That is, they must engage at some
point in a long chain of activities which will eventually lead to the
satisfaction of an unknown need at some remote time and place, after
passing through many intermediate stages directed to different ends.
The label which the market process attaches to the immediate product
is all the individual can know in most instances. No person engaged in
some stage of the process of making metallic screws, for instance, can
possibly rationally determine when, where, or how the particular piece
on which he is working will or ought to contribute to the satisfaction of
human needs. Nor do statistics help him to decide which of many
potential uses to which it (or any other similar item) could be put,
should be satisfied, and which not.
But also contributing to the feeling that the scale of values of means,
i.e., prices, is common or vulgar, is apparently that it is the same for all,
while different scales of ends are distinctive and personal. We prove our
individuality by asserting our particular tastes or by showing our more
discriminating appreciation of quality. Yet only because of information,
through prices, about the relative scarcity of different means are we able
to realise as many of our ends as we do.
The apparent conflict between the two kinds of hierarchies of values

becomes conspicuous in the extended order, in which most people earn
their living by providing means for others unknown to them, and
equally obtain the means they require for their own purposes from still
others also unknown to them. The only common scales of values thus
become those of means, whose importance does not chiefly depend on
effects perceived by those who use a particular item but are readily
substitutable for one another. Owing to demands for a great variety of
ends by a multiplicity of individuals, the concrete uses for which a
particular thing is wanted by others (and therefore the value each will
put on it) will not be known. This abstract character of the merely
instrumental value of means also contributes to the disdain for what is
felt to be the `artificial' or `unnatural' character of their value.

96

Adequate explanations of such puzzling and even alarming phenomena,
first discovered scarcely a hundred years ago, were disseminated as the
work of William Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Leon Walras was
developed, especially by the Austrian school following Menger, into
what became known as the `subjective' or `marginal utility' revolution
in economic theory. If what has been said in the preceding paragraphs
sounds unfamiliar as well as difficult, this suggests that the most
elementary and important discoveries of this revolution have even now
not reached general awareness. It was the discovery that economic
events could not be explained by preceding events acting as determining
causes that enabled these revolutionary thinkers to unify economic
theory into a coherent system. Although classical economics, or what is
often called `classical political economy', had already provided an
analysis of the process of competition, and particularly of the manner in
which international trade integrated national orders of cooperation into
an international one, only marginal utility theory brought real
understanding of how demand and supply were determined, of how
quantities were adapted to needs, and of how measures of scarcity
resulting from mutual adjustment guided individuals. The whole
market process then became understood as a process of transfer of
information enabling men to use, and put to work, much more
information and skill than they would have access to individually.
That the utility of an object or action, usually defined as its capacity
to satisfy human wants, is not of the same magnitude to different
individuals, now seems so obvious that it is difficult to understand how
serious scientists should ever have treated utility as an objective, general
and even measurable attribute of physical objects. That the relative
utilities of different objects to different persons can be distinguished
does not provide the least basis for comparisons of their absolute
magnitude. Nor, although people may agree how much they are
97

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF TRADE AND MONEY

individually prepared to contribute to the costs of different utilities, does
`collective utility' denote a discoverable object: it exists as little as a
collective mind, and is at best a metaphor. Nor does the fact that we all
occasionally decide that some object is more or less important to
another person than to ourselves provide any reason to believe in
objective interpersonal comparison of utility.
Indeed, in a certain sense the activity that economics sets out to
explain is not about physical phenomena but about people. Economic
values are interpretations of physical facts in the light of the degrees of
suitability of kinds of physical objects in particular situations for the
satisfaction of needs. Thus one might describe economics (what I now
prefer to call catallactics (Hayek, 1973)) as a metatheory, a theory about
the theories people have developed to explain how most effectively to
discover and use different means for diverse purposes. Under the
circumstances it is not so surprising that physical scientists, on
encountering such arguments, often find themselves in strange territory,
or that such economists often strike them more like philosophers than
` real' scientists.
Marginal utility theory is, although a basic advance, one that has
been obscured from the start. The most accessible early statement of the
idea in the English-speaking world, by W. S. Jevons, remained after his
early death, and also in consequence of the extra-academic position of
his single eminent follower, Wicksteed, long disregarded due to the
dominant academic authority of Alfred Marshall, who was reluctant to
depart from the position of John Stuart Mill. The Austrian codiscoverer of the theory, Carl Menger, was more fortunate in finding at
once two highly gifted pupils (Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk and Friedrich
von Wieser) to continue his work and to establish a tradition, with the
result that modern economic theory gradually came to be generally
accepted under the name of the `Austrian School'. By its stress on what
it called the `subjective' nature of economic values it produced a new
paradigm for explaining structures arising without design from human
interaction. Yet, during the last forty years, its contributions have been
obscured by the rise of 'macro-economics', which seeks causal
connections between hypothetically measurable entities or statistical
aggregates. These may sometimes, I concede, indicate some vague
probabilities, but they certainly do not explain the processes involved in
generating them.
But because of the delusion that macro-economics is both viable and
useful (a delusion encouraged by its extensive use of mathematics,
which must always impress politicians lacking any mathematical
education, and which is really the nearest thing to the practice of magic
that occurs among professional economists) many opinions ruling

contemporary government and politics are still based on naive
explanations of such economic phenomena as value and prices,
explanations that vainly endeavour to account for them as `objective'
occurrences independent of human knowledge and aims. Such explanations cannot interpret the function or appreciate the indispensability of
trading and markets for coordinating the productive efforts of large
numbers of people.

98

99

Some habits that have crept into mathematical analysis of the market
process often mislead even trained economists. For example, the practice of
referring to `the existing state of knowledge', and to information available to
acting members of a market process either as `data' or as `given' (or even by
the pleonasm of `given data'), often leads economists to assume that this
knowledge exists not merely in dispersed form but that the whole of it might
be available to some single mind. This conceals the character of competition
as a discovery procedure. What in these treatments of the market order is
represented as a `problem' to be solved is not really a problem to anyone in
the market, since the determining factual circumstances on which the market
in such an order depends cannot be known to anyone, and the problem is
not how to use given knowledge available as a whole, but how to make it
possible that knowledge which is not, and cannot be, made available to any
one mind, can yet be used, in its fragmentary and dispersed form, by many
interacting individuals - a problem not for the actors but for the
theoreticians trying to explain those actions.
The creation of wealth is not simply a physical process and cannot be
explained by a chain of cause and effect. It is determined not by
objective physical facts known to any one mind but by the separate,
differing, information of millions, which is precipitated in prices that
serve to guide further decisions. When the market tells an individual
entrepreneur that more profit is to be gained in a particular way, he can
both serve his own advantage and also make a larger contribution to the
aggregate (in terms of the same units of calculation that most others
use) than he could produce in any other available way. For these prices
inform market participants of crucial momentary conditions on which
the whole division of labour depends: the actual rate of convertibility
(or `substitutability') of different resources for one another, whether as
means to produce other goods or to satisfy particular human needs. For
this it is even irrelevant what quantities are available to mankind as a
whole. Such 'macro-economic' knowledge of aggregate quantities
available of different things is neither available nor needed, nor would it
even be useful. Any idea of measuring the aggregate product composed
of a great variety of commodities in varying combinations is mistaken:

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF TRADE AND MONEY

their equivalence for human purposes depends on human knowledge,
and only after we have translated physical quantities into economic
values can we begin to estimate such matters.
What is decisive for the magnitude of the product, and the chief
determinant generating particular quantities, is how those millions of
individuals who have distinctive knowledge of particular resources
combine them at various places and times into assemblies, choosing
among the great varieties of possibilities - none of which possibilities
can by itself be called the most effective without knowing the relative
scarcity of different elements as indicated by their prices.

primitive group may readily concede superior knowledge to a revered
leader, they resent it in the fellow who knows a way to obtain by little
perceptible effort what others can get only by hard work. To conceal
and to use superior information for individual or private gain is still
regarded as somehow improper - or at least unneighbourly. And these
primitive reactions remain active long after specialisation has become
the only way to make use of the acquisition of information in its great
variety.
Such reactions also continue today to influence political opinion and
action, to thwart the development of the most effective organisation of
production, and to encourage the false hopes of socialism. That
mankind - which owes the supplies on which it lives as much to trade
as to production - should despise the first but overly esteem the second
creates a state of affairs that cannot help but have a distorting effect on
political attitudes.
Ignorance of the function of trade, which led initially to fear, and in
the Middle Ages to uninformed regulation, and which only comparatively recently yielded to better understanding, has, then, now been
revived in a new pseudo-scientific form. In this form it lends itself to
attempts at technocratic economic manipulation which, when they
inevitably fail, encourage a modern form of distrust of `capitalism'. Yet
the situation may seem worse still when we turn our attention to certain
further ordering processes, even harder to understand than is trade, i.e.,
those governing money and finance.

The decisive step towards understanding the role of relative prices in
determining the best use of resources was Ricardo's discovery of the
principle of comparative costs, of which Ludwig von Mises rightly said that
it ought to be called the Ricardian Law of Association (1949:159-64). Price
relations alone tell the entrepreneur where return sufficiently exceeds costs to
make it profitable to devote limited capital to a particular undertaking. Such
signs direct him to an invisible goal, the satisfaction of the distant unknown
consumer of the final product.
The Intellectuals' Economic Ignorance

An understanding of trade and of marginal-utility explanations of the
determination of relative values is crucial for comprehending the order
on which the nourishment of the existing multitudes of human beings
depends. Such matters ought to be familiar to every educated person.
Such understanding has been thwarted by the general disdain with
which intellectuals tend to treat the entire subject. For the fact made
clear by marginal utility theory - namely, that it could become every
individual's distinct task, by his several knowledge and skills, to help
satisfy the needs of the community through a contribution of his choice is equally foreign to the primitive mind and to the reigning
constructivism, as well as to explicit socialism.
It is no exaggeration to say that this notion marks the emancipation
of the individual. To the development of the individualist spirit are due
(see chapters two and three above) the division of skills, knowledge and
labour on which advanced civilisation rests. As contemporary economic
historians like Braudel (1981-84) have begun to comprehend, the
disdained middleman, striving for gain, made possible the modern
extended order, modern technology, and the magnitude of our current
population. The ability, no less than the freedom, to be guided by one's
own knowledge and decisions, rather than being carried away by the
spirit of the group, are developments of the intellect which our emotions
have followed only imperfectly. Here again, although members of a

The Distrust of Money and Finance

Prejudice arising from the distrust of the mysterious reaches an even
higher pitch when directed at those most abstract institutions of an
advanced civilisation on which trade depends, which mediate the most
general, indirect, remote and unperceived effects of individual action,
and which, though indispensable for the formation of an extended
order, tend to veil their guiding mechanisms from probing observation:
money and the financial institutions based on it. The moment that
barter is replaced by indirect exchange mediated by money, ready
intelligibility ceases and abstract interpersonal processes begin that far
transcend even the most enlightened individual perception.
Money, the very `coin' of ordinary interaction, is hence of all things
the least understood and - perhaps with sex - the object of greatest
unreasoning fantasy; and like sex it simultaneously fascinates, puzzles
and repels. The literature treating it is probably greater than that
devoted to any other single subject; and browsing through it inclines
one to sympathise with the writer who long ago declared that no other
101

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF TRADE AND MONEY

subject, not even love, has driven more men to madness. `The love of
money', the Bible declares, `is the root of all evil' (I Timothy, 6:10). But
ambivalence about it is perhaps even more common: money appears as at
once the most powerful instrument of freedom and the most sinister tool
of oppression. This most widely-accepted medium of exchange conjures
up all the unease that people feel towards a process they cannot
understand, that they both love and hate, and some of whose effects
they desire passionately while detesting others that are inseparable from
the first.
The operation of the money and credit structure has, however, with
language and morals, been one of the spontaneous orders most resistant
to efforts at adequate theoretical explanation, and it remains the object
of serious disagreement among specialists. Even some professional
students have resigned themselves to the insight that the particulars
necessarily escape perception, and that the complexity of the whole
compels one to be content with accounts of abstract patterns that form
themselves spontaneously, accounts which, however enlightening, give
no power to predict any particular result.
Money and finance trouble not only the student. Like trade and for
many of the same reasons, they remain unremittingly suspect to
moralists. The moralist has several reasons for distrusting this universal
means of obtaining and manipulating power over the greatest variety of
ends in the least visible manner. First, whereas one could readily see
how many other objects of wealth were used, the concrete or particular
effects of the use of money on oneself or on other people often remain
indiscernible. Second, even when some of its effects are discernible, it
may be used for good and bad ends alike - hence the supreme
versatility that makes it so useful to its possessor also makes it the more
suspect to the moralist. Finally, its skilful use, and the large gains and
magnitudes arising from it, appear, as with commerce, divorced from
physical effort or recognisable merit, and need not even be concerned
with any material substrate - as in `purely paper transactions'. If
craftsmen and blacksmiths were feared for transforming material
substance, if traders were feared for transforming such intangible
qualities as value, how much more will the banker be feared for the
transformations he effects with the most abstract and immaterial of all
economic institutions? Thus we reach the climax of the progressive
replacement of the perceivable and concrete by abstract concepts
shaping rules guiding activity: money and its institutions seem to lie
beyond the boundary of laudable and understandable physical efforts of
creation, in a realm where the comprehension of the concrete ceases and
incomprehensible abstractions rule.
Thus the subject at once bewilders specialists and offends moralists:

Under government patronage the monetary system has grown to
great complexity, but so little private experimentation and selection
among alternative means has ever been permitted that we still do not
quite know what good money would be - or how good it could be. Nor
is such interference and monopoly a recent creation: it occurred almost
as soon as coinage was adopted as a generally accepted medium of
exchange. Though an indispensable requirement for the functioning of
an extensive order of cooperation of free people, money has almost from
its first appearance been so shamelessly abused by governments that it
has become the prime source of disturbance of all self-ordering
processes in the extended order of human cooperation. The history of
government management of money has, except for a few short happy
periods, been one of incessant fraud and deception. In this respect,
governments have proved far more immoral than any private agency
supplying distinct kinds of money in competition possibly could have

1 02

both are alarmed to find that the whole has outgrown our capacity to
survey or control the sequence of events on which we depend. It seems
all to have got out of hand, or as the German expression more tellingly
puts it, ist uns uber den Kopf gewachsen. No wonder the expressions that
refer to money are so emphatic, even hyperbolic. Perhaps some still
believe, as Cicero ( De officiis, 11:89) tells us of the elder Cato, that
money-lending is as bad as murder. Although the Roman followers of
the Stoics, such as Cicero himself and Seneca, did show more
understanding of such matters, current views about market-determined
rates of interest on loans are hardly more flattering, even though the
latter are so important in directing capital to its most productive uses.
Thus we still hear of the `cash nexus', `filthy lucre', `the acquisitive
instinct', and the activities of the `huckster' (for an account of all this
see Braudel, 1982b).
Nor do the problems end with the expression of rude epithets. Like
morality, law, language, and biological organisms, monetary institutions result from spontaneous order - and are similarly susceptible to
variation and selection. Yet monetary institutions turn out to be the
least satisfactorily developed of all spontaneously grown formations.
Few will, for example, dare to claim that their functioning has improved
during the last seventy years or so, since what had been an essentially
automatic mechanism based on an international metallic standard was
replaced, under the guidance of experts, by deliberate national
` monetary policies'. Indeed, humankind's experiences with money have
given good reason for distrusting it, but not for the reasons commonly
supposed. Rather, the selective processes are interfered with here more than
anywhere else: selection by evolution is prevented by government monopolies that
make competitive experimentation impossible.

been. I have suggested elsewhere, and will not argue again here, that
the market economy might well be better able to develop its
potentialities if government monopoly of money were abolished (Hayek,
1976/78, and 1986:8-10).
However this may be, our main subject here, the persistent adverse
opinion of `pecuniary considerations', is based on ignorance of the
indispensable role money plays in making possible the extended order of
human cooperation and general calculation in market values. Money is
indispensable for extending reciprocal cooperation beyond the limits of
human awareness - and therefore also beyond the limits of what was
explicable and could be readily recognised as expanding opportunities.
The Condemnation of Profit and the Contempt for Trade

THE MYSTERIOUS WORLD OF TRADE AND MONEY

things are more irresponsible than the derision of concern with costs by
intellectuals who, commonly, do not know how to go about finding out
how particular results are to be achieved at the least sacrifice of other
ends. These intellectuals are blinded by indignation about that essential
chance of very large gains that seem disproportionate to the effort
required in a particular case, but that alone makes this kind of
experimentation practicable.
It is hence hard to believe that anyone accurately informed about the
market can honestly condemn the search for profit. The disdain of profit
is due to ignorance, and to an attitude that we may if we wish admire in
the ascetic who has chosen to be content with a small share of the riches
of this world, but which, when actualised in the form of restrictions on
profits of others, is selfish to the extent that it imposes asceticism, and
indeed deprivations of all sorts, on others.

The objections of the beaux esprits of our own time - those intellectuals
we have just mentioned again, and with whom we were concerned in
earlier chapters - do not differ so very much from the objections of
members of primitive groups; and it is this that has inclined me to call
their demands and longings atavistic. What intellectuals steeped in
constructivist presuppositions find most objectionable in the market
order, in trade, in money and the institutions of finance, is that
producers, traders, and financiers are not concerned with concrete
needs of known people but with abstract calculation of costs and profit.
But they forget, or have not learned, the arguments that we have just
rehearsed. Concern for profit is just what makes possible the more
effective use of resources. It makes the most productive use of the
variety of potential support that can be enlisted from other business
undertakings. The high-minded socialist slogan, `Production for use, not
for profit', which we find in one form or another from Aristotle to
Bertrand Russell, from Albert Einstein to Archbishop Camara of Brazil
,(and often, since Aristotle, with the addition that these profits are made
at the expense of others'), betrays ignorance of how productive capacity
is multiplied by different individuals obtaining access to different
knowledge whose total exceeds what any single one of them could
muster. The entrepreneur must i n his activities probe beyond known
uses and ends if he is to provide means for producing yet other means
which in turn serve still others, and so on - that is, if he is to serve a
multiplicity of ultimate ends. Prices and profit are all that most producers
need to be able to serve more effectively the needs of men they do not
know. They are a tool for searching -just as, for the soldier or hunter,
the seaman or air pilot, the telescope extends the range of vision. The
market process gives most people the material and information
resources that they need in order to obtain what they want. Hence few

Trade, migration, and the increase and mixture of populations must not
only have opened people's eyes, but also loosened their tongues. It was
not simply that tradesmen inevitably encountered, and sometimes
mastered, foreign languages during their travels, but that this must
have forced them also to ponder the different connotations of key words
(if only to avoid either affronting their hosts or misunderstanding the
terms of agreements to exchange), and thereby to come to know new
and different views about the most basic matters. I should like now to
consider some of the problems relating to language that attend the
conflict between the primitive group and the extended order.
All people, whether primitive or civilised, organise what they perceive
partly by means of attributes that language has taught them to attach to
groups of sensory characteristics. Language enables us not only to label
objects given to our senses as distinct entities, but also to classify an
infinite variety of combinations of distinguishing marks according to
what we expect from them and what we may do with them. Such
labelling, classification, and distinction is of course often vague. More
i mportantly, all usage of language is laden with interpretations or
theories about our surroundings. As Goethe recognised, all that we
i magine to be factual is already theory: what we `know' of our
surroundings is our interpretation of them.
As a consequence, various difficulties arise in analysing and
criticising our own views. For example, many widely held beliefs live
only implicitly in words or phrases implying them and may never
become explicit; thus they are never exposed to the possibility of
criticism, with the result that language transmits not only wisdom but
also a type of folly that is difficult to eradicate.
It is also difficult to explain in a particular vocabulary - because of its
own limitations and because of the connotations it bears - something

that differs from what that language had traditionally been used to
explain. Not only is it difficult to explain, or even to describe something
new in received terms, it also may be hard to sort out what language
has previously classified in a particular manner - especially a manner
based on innate distinctions of our senses.
Such difficulties have driven some scientists to invent new languages
for their own disciplines. Reformers, and especially socialists, have been
driven by the same urge, and some of them have proposed deliberate
reformation of language in order the better to convert people to their
own position (see Bloch, 1954-59).
In view of such difficulties, our vocabulary, and the theories
embedded in it, are crucial. So long as we speak in language based in
erroneous theory, we generate and perpetuate error. Yet the traditional
vocabulary that still profoundly shapes our perception of the world and
of human interaction within it - and the theories and interpretations
embedded in that vocabulary - remain in many ways very primitive.
Much of it was formed during long past epochs in which our minds
interpreted very differently what our senses conveyed. Thus, while we
learn much of what we know through language, the meanings of
individual words lead us astray: we continue to use terms bearing
archaic connotations as we try to express our new and better
understanding of the phenomena to which they refer.
A pertinent example is the way transitive verbs ascribe to inanimate
objects some sort of mind-like action. Just as the naive or untutored
mind tends to assume the presence of life wherever it perceives
movement, it also tends to assume the activity of mind or spirit
wherever it imagines that there is purpose. The situation is aggravated
by the fact that, to some degree, the evolution of the human race seems
to repeat itself during the early development of each human mind. In
his account of The Child's Conception of the World (1929:359), Jean Piaget
writes: `The child begins by seeing purpose everywhere.' Only
secondarily is the mind concerned with differentiating between purposes
of the things themselves (animism) and purposes of the makers of the
things (artificialism). Animistic connotations cling to many basic words,
and particularly to those describing occurrences producing order. Not
only `fact' itself but also `to cause', `coerce', `distribute', `prefer', and
` organise', terms indispensable in the description of impersonal
processes, still evoke in many minds the idea of a personal actor.
The word `order' itself is a clear instance of an expression which,
before Darwin, would have been taken almost universally to imply a
personal actor. At the beginning of the last century even a thinker of the
stature of Jeremy Bentham maintained that `order presupposes an end'
(1789/1887, Works:II, 399). Indeed, it could be said that, until the

THE FATAL CONCEIT

OUR POISONED LANGUAGE

`subjective revolution' in economic theory of the 1870's, understanding
of human creation was dominated by animism - a conception from
which even Adam Smith's `invisible hand' provided only a partial
escape until, in the 1870's, the guide-role of competitively-determined
market prices came to be more clearly understood. Yet even now,
outside the scientific examination of law, language and the market,
studies of human affairs continue to be dominated by a vocabulary
chiefly derived from animistic thinking.
One of the most important examples comes from socialist writers.
The more closely one scrutinises their work, the more clearly one sees
that they have contributed far more to the preservation than to the
reformation of animistic thought and language. Take for instance the
personification of `society' in the historicist tradition of Hegel, Comte
and Marx. Socialism, with its `society', is indeed the latest form of those
animistic interpretations of order historically represented by various
religions (with their `gods'). The fact that socialism is often directed
against religion hardly mitigates this point. Imagining that all order is
the result of design, socialists conclude that order must be improvable
by better design of some superior mind. For this socialism deserves a
place in an authoritative inventory of the various forms of animism such as that given, in a preliminary way, by E. E. Evans-Pritchard in
his Theories of Primitive Religion (1965). In view of the continuing
influence of such animism, it seems premature even today to agree with
W. K. Clifford, a profound thinker who, already during Darwin's
lifetime, asserted that `purpose has ceased to suggest design to instructed
people except in cases where the agency of men is independently
probable' (1879:117).
The continuing influence of socialism on the language of intellectuals
and scholars is evident also in descriptive studies of history and
anthropology. As Braudel asks: `Who among us has not spoken about
the class struggle, the modes of production, the labour force, the surplus value,
the relative pauperisation, the practice, the alienation, the infrastructure, the
superstructure, the use value, the exchange value, the primitive accumulation, the
dialectics, the dictatorship of the proletariat ...?' (supposedly all derived
from or popularised by Karl Marx: see Braudel 1982b).
In most instances, underlying this sort of talk are not simple
statements of fact but interpretations or theories about consequences or
causes of alleged facts. To' Marx especially we also owe the substitution
of the term `society' for the state or compulsory organisation about
which he is really talking, a circumlocution that suggests that we can
deliberately regulate the actions of individuals by some gentler and
kinder method of direction than coercion. Of course the extended,
spontaneous order that has been the main subject matter of this volume

would have been as little able to `act' or to `treat' particular persons as
would a people or a population. On the other hand, the `state' or,
better, the `government', which before Hegel used to be the common
(and more honest) English word, evidently connoted for Marx too
openly and clearly the idea of authority while the vague term `society'
allowed him to insinuate that its rule would secure some sort of
freedom.
Thus, while wisdom is often hidden in the meaning of words, so is
error. Naive interpretations that we now know to be false, as well as
profoundly helpful if often unappreciated advice, survive and determine
our decisions through the words we use. Of particular relevance to our
discussion is the unfortunate fact that many words that we apply to
various aspects of the extended order of human cooperation carry
misleading connotations of an earlier kind of community. Indeed, many
words embodied in our language are of such a character that, if one
habitually employs them, one is led to conclusions not implied by any
sober thought about the subject in question, conclusions that also
conflict with scientific evidence. It was for this reason that in writing
this book I imposed upon myself the self-denying ordinance never to use
the words `society' or `social' (though they unavoidably occur
occasionally in titles of books and in quotations I draw from statements
of others; and I have also, on a few occasions, let the expressions `the
social sciences' or `social studies' stand). Yet, while I have not hitherto
used these terms, in this chapter I wish to discuss them - as well as some
other words that function similarly - to expose some of the poison
concealed in our language, particularly in that language which concerns
the orders and structures of human interaction and interrelationship.

The somewhat simplified quotation by Confucius that stands at the head
of this chapter is probably the earliest expression of this concern that has
been preserved. An abbreviated form in which I first encountered it
apparently stems from there being in Chinese no single word (or set of
characters) for liberty. It would also appear, however, that the passage
legitimately renders Confucius's account of the desirable condition of any
ordered group of men , as expressed in his Analects (tr. A. Waley, 1938:XIII,
3, 171-2): `If the language is incorrect ... the people will have nowhere to
put hand and foot'. I am obliged to David Hawkes, of Oxford, for having
traced a truer rendering of a passage I had often quoted in an incorrect
form.
The unsatisfactory character of our contemporary vocabulary of political
terms results from its descent largely from Plato and Aristotle who, lacking
the conception of evolution, considered the order of human affairs as an
arrangement of a fixed and unchanging number of men fully known to the

THE FATAL CONCEIT

governing authority - or, like most religions down to socialism, as the
designed product of some superior mind. (Anyone who wishes to pursue the
influence of words on political thinking will find rich information in
Demandt (1978). In English a helpful discussion of the deceptions brought
on by metaphorical language will be found in Cohen (1931); but the fullest
discussions of the political abuse of language known to me occur in the
German studies of Schoeck (1973), and in H. Schelsky (1975:233-249). I
have myself treated some of these matters earlier in my (1967/78:71-97;

OUR POISONED LANGUAGE

Elsewhere we have tried to disentangle some of the confusions caused
by the ambiguity of terms such as `natural' and `artificial' (see
Appendix A), of `genetic' and `cultural' and the like, and as the reader
will have noticed, I generally prefer the less usual but more precise term
`several property' to the more common expression `private property'.
There are of course many other ambiguities and confusions, some of
them of greater importance.
For instance, there was the deliberate deception practiced by
American socialists in their appropriation of the term `liberalism'. As
Joseph A. Schumpeter rightly put it (1954:394): `As a supreme if
unintended compliment, the enemies of the system of private enterprise
have thought it wise to appropriate its label.' The same applies
increasingly to European political parties of the middle, which either, as
in Britain, carry the name liberal or, as in West Germany, claim to be
liberal but do not hesitate to form coalitions with openly socialist
parties. It has, as I complained over twenty-five years ago (1960,
Postscript), become almost impossible for a Gladstonian liberal to
describe himself as a liberal without giving the impression that he
believes in socialism. Nor is this a new development: as long ago as
1911, L. T. Hobhouse published a book under the title Liberalism that
would more correctly have been called Socialism, promptly followed by a
book entitled The Elements of Social Justice (1922).
Important as is this particular change - one perhaps now beyond
remedying - we must concentrate here, in accordance with the general
theme of this book, on the ambiguities and vagueness caused by the
names generally given to phenomena of human interaction. The
inadequacy of the terms we use to refer to different forms of human
interaction is just one more symptom, one more manifestation, of the
prevailing, highly inadequate intellectual grasp of the processes by
which human efforts are coordinated. These terms are indeed so

inadequate that we can, in using them, not even delimit clearly what we
are talking about.
We may as well begin with the terms generally used to distinguish
between the two opposed principles of the order of human collaboration, capitalism and socialism, both of which are misleading and
politically biased. While intended to throw a certain light on these
systems, they tell us nothing relevant about their character. The word
` capitalism' in particular (still unknown to Karl Marx in 1867 and
never used by him) `burst upon political debate as the natural opposite
of socialism' only with Werner Sombart's explosive book Der moderne
Kapitalismus in 1902 (Braudel, 1982a:227). Since this term suggests a
system serving the special interests of the owners of capital, it naturally
provoked the opposition of those who, as we have seen, were its main
beneficiaries, the members of the proletariat. The proletariat was
enabled by the activity of owners of capital to survive and increase, and
was in a sense actually called into being by them. It is true that owners
of capital made the extended order of human intercourse possible, and
this might have led to some capitalists proudly accepting that name for
the result of their efforts. It was nevertheless an unfortunate
development in suggesting a clash of interests which does not really
exist.
A somewhat more satisfactory name for the extended economic order
of collaboration is the term `market economy', imported from the
German. Yet it too suffers from some serious disadvantages. In the first
instance, the so-called market economy is not really an economy in the
strict sense but a complex of large numbers of interacting individual
economies with which it shares some but by no means all defining
characteristics. If we give to the complex structures resulting from the
interaction of individual economies a name that suggests that they are
deliberate constructions, this yields the personification or animism to
which, as we have seen, so many misconceptions of the processes of
human interaction are due, and which we are at pains to escape. It is
necessary to be constantly reminded that the economy the market
produces is not really like products of deliberate human design but is a
structure which, while in some respects resembling an economy, in
other regards, particularly in not serving a unitary hierarchy of ends,
differs fundamentally from a true economy.
A second disadvantage of the term market economy is that in English
no convenient adjective can be derived from it, and such an expression
indicating the appropriateness of particular actions is indeed needed in
practice. Hence I proposed some time ago (1967/1978b:90) that we
introduce a new technical term, one obtained from a Greek root that
had already been used in a very similar connection. In 1838 Archbishop

Terminological Ambiguity and Distinctions among Systems of Coordination

THE FATAL CONCEIT

OUR POISONED LANGUAGE

Whately suggested 'catallactics' as a name for the theoretical science
explaining the market order, and his suggestion has been revived from
ti me to time, most recently by Ludwig von Mises. The adjective
` catallactic' is readily derived from Whately's coinage, and has already
been used fairly widely. These terms are particularly attractive because
the classical Greek word from which they stem, katalattein or katalassein,
meant not only `to exchange' but also `to receive into the community'
and `to turn from enemy into friend', further evidence of the profound
insight of the ancient Greeks in such matters (Liddell and Scott, 1940,
s.v. katallasso). This led me to suggest that we form the term catallaxy to
describe the object of the science we generally call economics, which
then, following Whately, itself ought to be called catallactics. The
usefulness of such an innovation has been confirmed by the former
term's already having been adopted by some of my younger colleagues
and I am convinced that its more general adoption might really
contribute to the clarity of our discussion.

ancient, and now obsolete, ideal of general human behaviour. Any real
appreciation of the difference between, on the one hand, what actually
characterises individual behaviour in a particular group and, on the
other, wishful thinking about what individual conduct should be (in
accordance with older customs) is increasingly lost. Not only is any
group of persons connected in practically any manner called a `society',
but it is concluded that any such group should behave as a primitive
group of companions did.
Thus the word `society' has become a convenient label denoting
almost any group of people, a group about whose structure or reason for
coherence nothing need be known - a makeshift phrase people resort to
when they do not quite know what they are talking about. Apparently a
people, a nation, a population, a company, an association, a group, a
horde, a band, a tribe, the members of a race, of a religion, sport,
entertainment, and the inhabitants of any particular place, all are, or
constitute, societies.
To call by the same name such completely different formations as the
companionship of individuals in constant personal contact and the
structure formed by millions who are connected only by signals
resulting from long and infinitely ramified chains of trade is not only
factually misleading but also almost always contains a concealed desire
to model this extended order on the intimate fellowship for which our
emotions long. Bertrand de Jouvenel has well described this instinctive
nostalgia for the small group - `the milieu in which man is first found,
which retains for him an infinite attraction: but any attempt to graft the
same features on a large society is utopian and leads to tyranny'
(1957:136).
The crucial difference overlooked in this confusion is that the small
group can be led in its activities by agreed aims or the will of its
members, while the extended order that is also a `society' is formed into
a concordant structure by its members' observance of similar rules of
conduct in the pursuit of different individual purposes. The result of
such diverse efforts under similar rules will indeed show a few
characteristics resembling those of an individual organism possessing a
brain or mind, or what such an organism deliberately arranges, but it is
misleading to treat such a `society' animistically, or to personify it by
ascribing to it a will, an intention, or a design. Hence it is disturbing to
find a serious contemporary scholar confessing that to any utilitarian
` society' must appear not `as a plurality of persons ... [but] as a sort of
single great person' (Chapman, 1964:153).

Our Animistic Vocabulary and the Confused Concept of `Society'

As such examples illustrate all too well, in the study of human affairs
difficulties of communication begin with the definition and naming of
the very objects we wish to analyse. The chief terminological barrier to
understanding, outranking in importance the other terms we have just
discussed, is the expression `society' itself - and not only inasmuch as it
has, since Marx, been used to blur distinctions between governments
and other `institutions'. As a word used to describe a variety of systems
of interconnections of human activities, `society' falsely suggests that all
such systems are of the same kind. It is also one of the oldest terms of
this kind, as for example in the Latin societas, from socius, the personally
known fellow or companion; and it has been used to describe both an
actually existing state of affairs and a relation between individuals. As
usually employed, it presupposes or implies a common pursuit of shared
purposes that usually can be achieved only by conscious collaboration.
As we have seen, it is one of the necessary conditions of the extension
of human cooperation beyond the limits of individual awareness that
the range of such pursuits be increasingly governed not by shared
purposes but by abstract rules of conduct whose observance brings it
about that we more and more serve the needs of people whom we do not
know and find our own needs similarly satisfied by unknown persons.
Thus the more the range of human cooperation extends, the less does
motivation within it correspond to the mental picture people have of
what should happen in a `society', and the more `social' comes to be not
the key word in a statement of the facts but the core of an appeal to an
11 2

OUR POISONED LANGUAGE

THE FATAL CONCEIT

The Weasel Word `Social'
The noun `society', misleading as it is, is relatively innocuous compared
with the adjective `social', which has probably become the most
confusing expression in our entire moral and political vocabulary. This
has happened only during the past hundred years, during which time its
modern usages, and its power and influence, have expanded rapidly
from Bismarckian Germany to cover the whole world. The confusion
that it spreads, within the very area wherein it is most used, is partly
due to its describing not only phenomena produced by various modes of
cooperation among men, such as in a `society', but also the kinds of
actions that promote and serve such orders. From this latter usage it
has increasingly been turned into an exhortation, a sort of guide-word
for rationalist morals intended to displace traditional morals, and now
increasingly supplants the word `good' as a designation of what is
morally right. As a result of this `distinctly dichotomous' character, as
Webster's New Dictionary of Synonyms appropriately puts it, factual and
normative meanings of the word `social' constantly alternate, and what
at first seems a description imperceptibly turns into a prescription.
On this particular matter, German usage influenced the American language
more than English; for by the eighteen-eighties a group of German scholars
known as the historical or ethical school of economic research had
increasingly substituted the term `social policy' for the term `political
economy' to designate the study of human interaction. One of the few not to
be swept away by this new fashion, Leopold von Wiese, later remarked that
only those who were young in the `social age' - in the decades immediately
before the Great War - can appreciate how strong at that time was the
inclination to regard the `social' sphere as a surrogate for religion. One of the
most dramatic manifestations of this was the appearance of the so-called
social pastors. But `to be "social" ', Wiese insists, `is not the same as being
good or righteous or "righteous in the eyes of God" ' (1917). To some of
Wiese's students we owe instructive historical studies on the spreading of the
term `social' (see my references in 1976:180).
The extraordinary variety of uses to which the word `social' has since
been put in English is brought home vividly when in the Fontana
Dictionary of Modern Thought (1977), cited earlier in another context, is
found, appropriately preceded by `Soap Opera', a series of no less than
thirty-five combinations of `social' with some noun or other, from
`Social Action' to `Social Wholes'. In a similar effort, R. Williams's Key
Words (1976), the author, although generally referring the reader, with
the conventional 'q.v.', to corresponding entries, departed from this
114

practice with regard to `social'. Apparently it would have been
i mpractical for him to follow his policy here, and he simply had to
abandon it. These examples led me for a while to note down all

but from which one wishes to eliminate all implications that challenge

On current American usage of the expression see the late Mario Pei's Weasel
Words: The Art of Saying What You Don't Mean (1978), which credits Theodore
Roosevelt with having coined the term in 1 918, thus suggesting that seventy
years ago American statesmen were remarkably well educated. Yet the
reader will not find in that book the prize weasel word `social'.
Though abuse of the word `social' is international, it has taken
perhaps its most extreme forms in West Germany where the
constitution of 1949 employed the expression sozialer Rechtsstaat (social
rule of law) and whence the conception of `social market economy' has
spread - in a sense which its populariser Ludwig Erhard certainly never
intended. (He once assured me in conversation that to him the market
economy did not have to be made social but was so already as a result of
its origin.) But while the rule of law and the market are, at the start,
fairly clear concepts, the attribute `social' empties them of any clear
meaning. From these uses of the word `social', German scholars have
come to the conclusion that their government is constitutionally subject
to the Sozialstaatsprinzip, which means little less than that the rule of law
has been suspended. Likewise, such German scholars see a conflict
between Rechtsstaat and Sozialstaat and entrench the soziale Rechtsstaat i n
their constitution - one, I may perhaps say, that was written by Fabian
muddle-heads inspired by the nineteenth-century inventor of `National
Socialism', Friedrich Naumann (H. Maier, 1972:8).
Similarly, the term `democracy' used to have a fairly clear meaning; yet
`social democracy' not only served as the name for the radical Austro-Marxism of the inter-war period but now has been chosen in Britain as a
label for a political party committed to a sort of Fabian socialism. Yet the
traditional term for what is now called the `social state' was `benevolent
despotism', and the very real problem of achieving such despotism
democratically, i.e., while preserving individual freedom, is simply wished
away by the concoction `social democracy'.

Many of the combinations given here are even more widely used in a
negative, critical form: thus `social adjustment' becomes `social
maladjustment', and the same for `social disorder', `social injustice',
`social insecurity', `social instability', and so on.
It is difficult to conclude from this list alone whether the word `social'
has acquired so many different meanings as to become useless as a tool
of communication. However this may be, its practical effect is quite
clear and at least threefold. First, it tends pervertedly to insinuate a
notion that we have seen from previous chapters to be misconceived namely, that what has been brought about by the impersonal and
spontaneous processes of the extended order is actually the result of
deliberate human creation. Second, following from this, it appeals to
men to redesign what they never could have designed at all. And third,
it also has acquired the power to empty the nouns it qualifies of their
meaning.
In this last effect, it has in fact become the most harmful instance of
what, after Shakespeare's `I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a
weasel suck eggs' ( As You Like It, 11,5), some Americans call a `weasel
word'. As a weasel is alleged to be able to empty an egg without leaving
a visible sign, so can these words deprive of content any term to which
they are prefixed while seemingly leaving them untouched. A weasel
word is used to draw the teeth from a concept one is obliged to employ,

Much the worst use of `social', one that wholly destroys the meaning of
any word it qualifies, is in the almost universally used phrase `social
justice'. Though I have dealt with this particular matter already at
some length, particularly in the second volume on The Mirage of Social
Justice in my Law, Legislation and Liberty, I must at least briefly state the
point again here, since it plays such an important part in arguments for
and against socialism. The phrase `social justice' is, as a distinguished

'Social justice' and `Social Rights'

THE FATAL CONCEIT

OUR POISONED LANGUAGE

man more courageous than I bluntly expressed it long ago, simply ` a
semantic fraud from the same stable as People's Democracy' (Curran,
1958:8). The alarming extent to which the term seems already to have
perverted the thinking of the younger generation is shown by a recent
Oxford doctor's thesis on Social justice ( Miller, 1976), in which the
traditional conception of justice is referred to by the extraordinary
remark that `there appears to be a category of private justice'.
I have seen it suggested that `social' applies to everything that
reduces or removes differences of income. But why call such action
`social'? Perhaps because it is a method of securing majorities, that is,
votes in addition to those one expects to get for other reasons? This does
seem to be so, but it also means of course that every exhortation to us to
be `social' is an appeal for a further step towards the `social justice' of
socialism. Thus use of the term `social' becomes virtually equivalent to
the call for `distributive justice'. This is, however, irreconcilable with a
competitive market order, and with growth or even maintenance of
population and of wealth. Thus people have come, through such errors,
to call `social' what is the main obstacle to the very maintenance of
`society'. `Social' should really be called 'anti-social'.
It is probably true that men would be happier about their economic
conditions if they felt that the relative positions of individuals were just.
Yet the whole idea behind distributive justice - that each individual
ought to receive what he morally deserves - is meaningless in the
extended order of human cooperation (or the catallaxy), because the
available product (its size, and even its existence) depends on what is in
one sense a morally indifferent way of allocating its parts. For reasons
already explored, moral desert cannot be determined objectively, and in
any case the adaptation of the larger whole to facts yet to be discovered
requires that we accept that `success is based on results, not on
motivation' (Alchian, 1950:213). Any extended system of cooperation
must adapt itself constantly to changes in its natural environment
( which include the life, health and strength of its members); the
demand that only changes with just effect should occur is ridiculous. It
is nearly as ridiculous as the belief that deliberate organisation of
response to such changes can be just. Mankind could neither have
reached nor could now maintain its present numbers without an
i nequality that is neither determined by, nor reconcilable with, any
deliberate moral judgements. Effort of course will improve individual
chances, but it alone cannot secure results. The envy of those who have
tried just as hard, although fully understandable, works against the
common interest. Thus, if the common interest is really our interest, we
must not give in to this very human instinctual trait, but instead allow
the market process to determine the reward. Nobody can ascertain, save

through the market, the size of an individual's contribution to the
overall product, nor can it otherwise be determined how much
remuneration must be tendered to someone to enable him to choose the
activity which will add most to the flow of goods and services offered at
large. Of course if the latter should be considered morally good, then
the market turns out to produce a supremely moral result.
Mankind is split into two hostile groups by promises that have no
realisable content. The sources of this conflict cannot be dissipated by
compromise, for every concession to factual error merely creates more
unrealisable expectations. Yet, an anti-capitalist ethic continues to
develop on the basis of 'errors by people who condemn the wealth-genratisuowhcteymslvohirxtenc.
Pretending to be lovers of freedom, they condemn several property,
contract, competition, advertising, profit, and even money itself.
Imagining that their reason can tell them how to arrange human efforts
to serve their innate wishes better, they themselves pose a grave threat
to civilisation.

EIGHT

THE EXTENDED ORDER AND POPULATION GROWTH

I have been attempting to explain how the extended order of human
cooperation has evolved despite opposition from our instincts, despite
fear of all the uncertainties inherent in spontaneous processes, despite
widespread economic ignorance, and despite the distillation of all these
in movements that seek to use allegedly rational means to achieve
genuinely atavistic ends. I have also maintained that the extended order
would collapse, and that much of our population would suffer and die, if
such movements ever did truly succeed in displacing the market. Like it
or not, the current world population already exists. Destroying its
material foundation in order to attain the `ethical' or instinctually
gratifying improvements advocated by socialists would be tantamount
to condoning the death of billions and the impoverishment of the rest.
(See also my 1954/1967:208; and 1983:25-29.)
The close connection between population size and the presence of,
and benefits of, certain evolved practices, institutions, and forms of
human interaction is hardly a new discovery. That `as it is the power of
exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of
this division must always be limited by the extent of this power, or, in
other words, by the extent of the market' was one of Adam Smith's
profoundest insights (1776/1976:31); cf. also the two `Fragments on the
Division of Labour' in Lectures on jurisprudence (1978:582-586). That
those following competitive market practices would, as they grew in
numbers, displace others who followed different customs, was also seen
early. Following John Locke's similar claim in the Second Treatise
(1690/1887), the American historian James Sullivan remarked, as early
as 1795, how the native Americans had been displaced by European
colonists, and that now five hundred thinking beings could prosper in
the same area where previously only a single savage could `drag out a

hungry existence' as a hunter (1795:139). (The native American tribes
that continued to engage primarily in hunting were displaced also from
another direction: by tribes that had learnt to practise agriculture.)
Although the displacement of one group by another, and of one set of
practices by another, has often been bloody, it does not need always to
be so. No doubt the course of events differed from place to place, and
we can hardly go into the details here, but one can imagine many
different sequences of events. In some places invaded, as it were, by the
extended order, those following new practices, who could extract more
from the given land, would often be able to offer other occupants, in
return for access to their land (without the occupants having to do any
work at all, and without the `invaders' having to use force), nearly as
much as, and sometimes even more than, these occupants had obtained
by hard toil. On the other hand, the very density of their own
settlements would have enabled more advanced people to resist
attempts to evict them from extensive territories that they had used, and
needed, during periods when they themselves had practised more
primitive methods of land use. Many of these processes may then have
happened entirely peacefully, although the greater military strength of
commercially organised people will often have accelerated the process.
Even if the extension of the market and the growth of population
could be achieved entirely by peaceful means, well-informed and
thoughtful people are, nevertheless, increasingly reluctant today to
continue to accept the association between population growth and the
rise of civilisation. Quite the contrary, as they contemplate our present
population density and, more especially, the acceleration in the rate of
population increase during the past three hundred years, they have
become highly alarmed, and construe the prospect of increasing growth
of population as a disaster of nightmare quality. Even a sensible
philosopher like A. G. N. Flew (1967:60) praised Julian Huxley for
recognising early, `before this was even as widely admitted as it now is,
that human fertility represents the number one threat to the present and
future welfare of the human race'.
I have been contending that socialism constitutes a threat to the
present and future welfare of the human race, in the sense that neither
socialism nor any other known substitute for the market order could
sustain the current population of the world. But reactions like the one
just quoted, as often as not made by people who do not themselves
advocate socialism, suggest that a market order that produces, and is
produced by, such a large population also poses a serious threat to the
welfare of mankind. Obviously this conflict must now be addressed.
The modern idea that population growth threatens worldwide
pauperisation is simply a mistake. It is largely a consequence of

THE EXTENDED ORDER AND
POPULATION GROWTH

The most decisive of the prosperity of any country is the increase of the
number of its inhabitants.
Adam Smith
The Malthusian Scare: The Fear of Overpopulation

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE EXTENDED ORDER AND POPULATION GROWTH

oversimplifying the Malthusian theory of population; Thomas Malthus's
theory made a reasonable first approach to the problem in his own time,
but modern conditions make it irrelevant. Malthus's assumption that
human labour could be regarded as a more or less homogeneous factor
of production (i.e., wage labour was all of the same kind, employed in
agriculture, with the same tools and the same opportunities) was not far
from the truth in the economic order that then existed (a theoretical
two-factor economy). For Malthus, who was also one of the first
discoverers of the law of decreasing returns, this must have indicated
that every increase in the number of labourers would lead to a reduction
of what is now called marginal productivity, and therefore of worker
income, particularly once the best land had been occupied by plots of
optimum size. (On the relation between Malthus's two theorems see
McCleary, 1953:111.)
This ceases to be true, however, under the changed conditions we
have been discussing, wherein labour is not homogeneous but is
diversified and specialised. With the intensification of exchange, and
i mproving techniques of communication and transportation, an increase
of numbers and density of occupation makes division of labour
advantageous, leads to radical diversification, differentiation and
specialisation, makes it possible to develop new factors of production,
and heightens productivity (see chapters two and three above, and also
below). Different skills, natural or acquired, become distinct scarce
factors, often manifoldly complementary; this makes it worthwhile to
workers to acquire new skills which will then fetch different market
prices. Voluntary specialisation is guided by differences in expected
rewards. Thus labour may yield increasing rather than decreasing
returns. A denser population can also employ techniques and
technology that would have been useless in more thinly occupied
regions; and if such technologies have already been developed elsewhere
they may well be imported and adopted rapidly (provided the required
capital can be obtained). Even the bare fact of living peacefully in
constant contact with larger numbers makes it possible to utilise
available resources more fully.
When, in such a way, labour ceases to be a homogeneous factor of
production, Malthus's conclusions cease to apply. Rather, an increase of
population may now, because of further differentiation, make still further
increases of population possible, and for indefinite periods population
increase may be both self-accelerating and a pre-requisite for any
advance in both material and (because of the individuation made
possible) spiritual civilisation.
It is, then, not simply more men, but more different men, which
brings an increase in productivity. Men have become powerful because

they have become so different: new possibilities of specialisation depending not so much on any increase in individual intelligence but on
growing differentiation of individuals - provide the basis for a more
successful use of the earth's resources. This in turn requires an
extension of the network of indirect reciprocal services which the
signalling mechanism of the market secures. As the market reveals ever
new opportunities of specialisation, the two-factor model, with its
Malthusian conclusions, becomes increasingly inapplicable.
The widely prevailing fear that the growth of population that attends
and fosters all this is apt to lead to general impoverishment and disaster
is thus largely due to the misunderstanding of a statistical calculation.
This is not to deny that an increase of population may lead to a
reduction of average incomes. But this possibility is also misinterpreted
- the misinterpretation here being due to conflating the average income
of a number of existing people in different income classes with the
average income of a later, larger number of people. The proletariat are
an additional population that, without new opportunities of employment,
would never have grown up. The fall in average income occurs simply
because great population growth generally involves a greater increase of
the poorer, rather than the richer, strata of a population. But it is
incorrect to conclude that anybody needs to have become poorer in the
process. No single member of an existing community need to have
become poorer (though some well-to-do people are likely, in the process,
to be displaced by some of the newcomers and to descend to a lower
level). Indeed, everyone who was already there might have grown
somewhat richer; and yet average incomes may have decreased if large
numbers of poor people have been added to those formerly present. It is
trivially true that a reduction of the average is compatible with all
income groups having increased in numbers, but with higher ones
increasing in numbers less than the lower ones. That is, if the base of
the income pyramid grows more than its height, the average income of
the increased total will be smaller.
But it would be more accurate to conclude from this that the process
of growth benefits the larger number of the poor more than the smaller
number of the rich. Capitalism created the possibility of employment. It
created the conditions wherein people who have not been endowed by
their parents with the tools and land needed to maintain themselves and
their offspring could be so equipped by others, to their mutual benefit.
For the process enabled people to live poorly, and to have children, who
otherwise, without the opportunity for productive work, could hardly
even have grown to maturity and multiplied: it brought into being and
kept millions alive who otherwise would not have lived at all and who, if
they had lived for a time, could not have afforded to procreate. In this

1 22

way the poor benefited more from the process. Karl Marx was thus
right to claim that `capitalism' created the proletariat: it gave and gives them

THE EXTENDED ORDER AND POPULATION GROWTH

Another source of misunderstanding is the tendency to think of
population growth in purely global terms. The population problem
must be seen as regional, with different aspects in different areas. The
real problem is whether the numbers of inhabitants of particular regions
tend, for whatever reason, to outgrow the resources of their own areas
(including the resources they can use to trade).
As long as an increase in population has been made possible by the
growing productivity of the populations in the regions concerned, or by
more effective utilisation of their resources, and not by deliberate

artificial support of this growth from outside, there is little cause for
concern. Morally, we have as little right to prevent the growth of
population in other parts of the world as we have a duty to assist it. On
the other hand, a moral conflict may indeed arise if materially advanced
countries continue to assist and indeed even subsidise the growth of
populations in regions, such as perhaps the Sahel zone in Central
Africa, where there appears to exist little prospect that its present
population, let alone an increased one, will in the foreseeable future be
able to maintain itself by its own efforts. With any attempt to maintain
populations beyond the volume at which accumulated capital could still
be currently reproduced, the number that could be maintained would
diminish. Unless we interfere, only such populations will increase
further as can feed themselves. The advanced countries, by assisting
populations such as that in the Sahel to increase, are arousing
expectations, creating conditions involving obligations, and thus
assuming a grave responsibility on which they are very likely sooner or
later to default. Man is not omnipotent; and recognising the limits of his
powers may enable him to approach closer to realising his wishes than
following natural impulses to remedy remote suffering about which he
can, unfortunately, do little if anything.
In any case, there is no danger whatever that, in any foreseeable
future with which we can be concerned, the population of the world as a
whole will outgrow its raw material resources, and every reason to
assume that inherent forces will stop such a process long before that
could happen. (See the studies of Julian L. Simon (1977, 1981a & b),
Esther Boserup (1981), Douglas North (1973, 1981) and Peter Bauer
(1981), as well as my own 1954:15 and 1967:208.)
For there are, in the temperate zones of all continents except Europe,
wide regions which can not merely bear an increase in population, but
whose inhabitants can hope to approach the standards of general
wealth, comfort, and civilisation that the `Western' world has already
reached only by increasing the density of their occupation of their land
and the intensity of exploitation of its resources. In these regions the
population must multiply if its members are to achieve the standards for
which they strive. It is in their own interest to increase their numbers,
and it would be presumptuous, and hardly defensible morally, to advise
them, let alone to coerce them, to hold down their numbers. While
serious problems may arise if we attempt indiscriminately to preserve
all human lives everywhere, others cannot legitimately object to an
increase in numbers on the part of a group that is able to maintain its
own numbers by its own efforts. Inhabitants of countries already
wealthy hardly have any right to call for an `end to growth' (as did the
Club of Rome or the later production Global 2000), or to obstruct the

124

1 25

life.

Thus the whole idea that the rich wrested away from the poor what,
without such acts of violence would, or at least might, belong to them, is
absurd.
The size of the stock of capital of a people, together with its
accumulated traditions and practices for extracting and communicating
information, determine whether that people can maintain large
numbers. People will be employed, and materials and tools produced to
serve future needs of unknown persons, only if those who can invest
capital to bridge the interval between present outlay and future return
will gain an increment from doing this which is at least as great as what
they could have obtained from other uses of that capital.
Thus without the rich - without those who accumulated capital those poor who could exist at all would be very much poorer indeed,
scratching a livelihood from marginal lands on which every drought
would kill most of the children they would be trying to raise. The
creation of capital altered such conditions more than anything else. As
the capitalist became able to employ other people for his own purposes,
his ability to feed them served both him and them. This ability
i ncreased further as some individuals were able to employ others not
just directly to satisfy their own needs but to trade goods and services
with countless others. Thus property, contract, trade, and the use of
capital did not simply benefit a minority.
Envy and ignorance lead people to regard possessing more than one
needs for current consumption as a matter for censure rather than
merit. Yet the idea that such capital must be accumulated `at the
expense of others' is a throwback to economic views that, however
obvious they may seem to some, are actually groundless, and make an
accurate understanding of economic development impossible.
The Regional Character of the Problem

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE EXTENDED ORDER AND POPULATION GROWTH

countries in question, which rightly resent any such policies.
Some notions that attend such recommended policies for restricting
population - for example, that advanced peoples should turn parts of
the territories inhabited by still undeveloped people into a sort of nature
park - are indeed outrageous. The idyllic image of happy primitives
who enjoy their rural poverty and will gladly forego the development
that alone can give many of them access to what they have come to
regard as the benefits of civilisation is based on fantasy. Such benefits
do, as we have seen, demand certain instinctual and other sacrifices.
But less advanced people must decide for themselves, individually,
whether material comfort and advanced culture is worth the sacrifices
involved. They should, of course, not be forced to modernise; nor should
they be prevented, through a policy of isolation, from seeking the
opportunities of modernisation.
With the sole exception of instances where the increase of the
numbers of the poor has led governments to redistribute incomes in
their favour, there is no instance in history wherein an increase of
population reduced the standards of life of those in that population who
had already achieved various levels. As Simon has convincingly argued,
` There are not now, and there never have been, any empirical data
showing that population growth or size or density have a negative effect
on the standard of living' (1981a:18, and see also his major works on
this subject, 1977 and 1981b).

part of humankind can now maintain itself just because its members are
so flexible, just because there are so many different individuals whose
different gifts enable them to differentiate themselves from one another
even further by absorbing a boundless variety of combinations of
differing streams of traditions.
The diversity for which increasing density provided new opportunities was essentially that of labour and skills, of information and
knowledge, of property and incomes. The process is neither simple nor
causal nor predictable, for at each step increasing population density
merely creates unrealised possibilities which may or may not be
discovered and realised rapidly. Only where some earlier population
had already passed through this stage and its example could be
i mitated, could the process be very rapid. Learning proceeds through a
multiplicity of channels and presupposes a great variety of individual
positions and connections among groups and individuals through which
possibilities of collaboration emerge.
Once people learn to take advantage of new opportunities offered by
increased density of population (not only because of the specialisation
brought about by division of labour, knowledge and property, but also
by some individual accumulation of new forms of capital), this becomes
the basis of yet further increases. Thanks to multiplication, differentiation, communication and interaction over increasing distances, and
transmission through time, mankind has become a distinct entity
preserving certain structural features that can produce effects beneficial
to a further increase of numbers.
So far as we know, the extended order is probably the most complex
structure in the universe - a structure in which biological organisms
that are already highly complex have acquired the capacity to learn, to
assimilate, parts of suprapersonal traditions enabling them to adapt
themselves from moment to moment into an ever-changing structure
possessing an order of a still higher level of complexity. Step by step,
momentary impediments to further population increase are penetrated,
increases in population provide a foundation for further ones, and so on,
leading to a progressive and cumulative process that does not end
before all the fertile or richly endowed parts of the earth are similarly
densely occupied.

Diversity and Differentiation

Differentiation is the key to understanding population growth, and we
should pause to expand on this crucial point. The unique achievement
of man, leading to many of his other distinct characteristics, is his
differentiation and diversity. Apart from a few other species in which
selection' artificially imposed by man has produced comparable
diversity, man's diversification is unparalleled. This occurred because,
in the course of natural selection, humans developed a highly efficient
organ for learning from their fellows. This has made the increase of
man's numbers, over much of his history, not, as in other instances, self-limiting, but rather self-stimulating. Human population grew in a sort of
chain reaction in which greater density of occupation of territory tended to
produce new opportunities for specialisation and thus led to an increase
of individual productivity and in turn to a further increase of numbers.
There also developed among such large numbers of people not only a
variety of innate attributes but also an enormous variety of streams of
cultural traditions among which their great intelligence enabled them to
select - particularly during their prolonged adolescence. The greater
126

The Centre and the Periphery

And it may indeed end there: I do not think that the much-dreaded
population explosion - leading to `standing room only' - is going to
occur. The whole story of population growth may now be approaching
its end, or at least approaching a very new level. For the highest
127

THE FATAL CONCEIT

THE EXTENDED ORDER AND POPULATION GROWTH

population growth has never taken place in developed market
economies but always on the peripheries of developed economies,
among those poor who had no fertile land and equipment that would
have enabled them to maintain themselves, but to whom `capitalists'
offered new opportunities for survival.
These peripheries are, however, disappearing. Moreover, there are
hardly any countries left to enter the periphery: the explosive process of
population expansion has, during the last generation or so, very nearly
reached the last corners of the earth.
Consequently there is strong reason to doubt the accuracy of
extrapolating the trend of the last several centuries - of an indefinitely
increasing acceleration of population growth - into the indefinite future.
We may hope and expect that once the remaining reservoir of people
who are now entering the extended order is exhausted, the growth of
their numbers, which distresses people so much, will gradually recede.
After all, no fairly wealthy group shows any such tendency. We do not
know enough to say when the turning point will be reached, but we can
fairly assume that it will be very long indeed before we approach the
horrors which the fancy of the ineluctable indefinite increase of mankind
conjures up.
I suspect that the problem is already diminishing: that the population
growth rate is now approaching, or has already reached, its maximum,
and will not increase much further but will decline. One cannot of
course say for certain, but it appears that - even if this has not already
occurred - some time in the last decade of this century population
growth will reach a maximum and that, afterwards, it will decline
unless there is deliberate intervention to stimulate it.
Already in the mid 1960's, the annual rate of growth of the
developing regions peaked at around 2.4 percent, and began to decline
to the present level of around 2.1 percent. And the population growth
rate in more developed regions was already on the decline by this same
ti me. In the mid 'sixties, then, population seems to have reached, and
then retreated from, an all-time high annual growth rate (United
Nations, 1980, and J. E. Cohen, 1984:50-51). As Cohen writes:
` humankind has begun to practice or to experience the restraint that
governs all its fellow species.'
The processes at work may become more comprehensible if we take a
closer look at the populations at the peripheries of the developing
economies. The best examples are perhaps to be found in those fastgrowing cities of the developing world - Mexico City, Cairo, Calcutta,
Sao Paulo or Jakarta, Caracas, Lagos, Bombay - where the population
has doubled or more over a short span and where old city centers tend
to be surrounded by shanty towns or 'bidonvilles'.

The increase of population taking place in these cities stems from the
fact that people living on peripheries of market economies, while
already profiting from their participation in them (through, for
example, access to more advanced medicine, to better information of all
sorts, and to advanced economic institutions and practices), have
nonetheless not adapted fully to the traditions, morality, and customs of
these economies. For example, they still may practice customs of
procreation stemming from circumstances outside the market economy
where, for instance, the first response of poor people to a slight increase
of wealth had been to produce a number of descendants at least
sufficient to provide for them in their old age. These old customs are
now gradually, and in some places even quickly, disappearing, and
these peripheral groups, particularly those closest to the core, are
absorbing traditions that allow them better to regulate their propagation.
After all, the growing commercial centers become magnets in part just
because they provide models of how to achieve through imitation what
many people desire.
These shanty towns, which are interesting in themselves, also
illustrate several other themes developed earlier. For example, the
population of the countryside around these cities has not been depleted
at the expense of the shanty towns; usually it too has profited from the
growth of the cities. The cities offered sustenance to millions who
otherwise would have died or never been born had they (or their
parents) not migrated to them. Those who did migrate to the cities (or
to their peripheries) were led there neither by the benevolence of the
city folk in offering jobs and equipment nor by the benevolent advice of
their better-off country `neighbours', but rather by following rumours
about other unknown poor folk (perhaps in some remote mountain
valley) who were saved by being drawn into the growing towns by news
of paid work available there. Ambition, even greed, for a better life, not
beneficence, preserved these lives: yet it did better than beneficence
could have done. The people from the countryside learned from market
signals - although they could hardly have understood the matter in
such abstract terms - that income not currently consumed by rich men
in the cities was being used to provide others with tools or livelihood in
payment for work, enabling people to survive who had not inherited
arable land and the tools to cultivate it.
Of course it may be hard for some to accept that those living in these
shanty towns deliberately chose them over the countryside (about
which people have such romantic feelings) as places of sustenance. Yet,
as with the Irish and English peasants Engels found in the Manchester
slums of his own time, that is what happened.
The squalor of these peripheral areas is primarily due to the very

1 28

129

THE FATAL CONCEIT

economic marginality that dictated residence there rather than in the
countryside. Also not to be ignored are the adverse `cyclical' effects of
third-world governments' attempts to manage their economies, and of
the ability of these governments to remove employment opportunities
from peripheral groups as concessions to established labour interests or
misguided social reformers.
Finally - and here one may sometimes witness the selection process at
something like first hand, and in its most naked form - the effects of
commercial morals do not fall most harshly and visibly on those who
have already learnt to practise them in a relatively more advanced
form, but rather on newcomers who have not yet learnt how to cope
with them. Those who live on the peripheries do not yet fully observe
the new practices (and thus are almost always perceived as 'undesirable' and often thought even to border on the criminal). They are also
experiencing personally the first impact that some practices of more
advanced civilisation exert on people who still feel and think according
to the morality of the tribe and village. However painful for them this
process may be, they too, or they especially, benefit from the division of
labour formed by the practices of the business classes; and many of
them gradually change their ways, only then improving the quality of
their lives. At least a minimal change of conduct on their part will be a
condition for their being permitted to enter the larger established group
and gradually to gain an increasing share in its total product.
For the numbers kept alive by differing systems of rules decide which
system will dominate. These systems of rules will not necessarily be
those that the masses (of which the shanty-town dwellers are only a
dramatic example) themselves have already fully adopted, but those
followed by a nucleus around whose periphery increasing numbers
gather to participate in gains from the growing total product. Those
who do at least partially adopt, and benefit from, the practices of the
extended order often do so without being aware of the sacrifices such
changes will also eventually involve. Nor is it only primitive country
folk who have had to learn hard lessons: military conquerors who lorded
over a subject population and even destroyed its elite often later had to
learn, sometimes to their regret, that to enjoy local benefits required
adopting local practices.
Capitalism Gave Life to the Proletariat

We may in our remaining sections perhaps draw together some of our
main arguments and note some of their implications.
If we ask what men most owe to the moral practices of those who are
called capitalists the answer is: their very lives. Socialist accounts which
ascribe the existence of the proletariat to an exploitation of groups
1 2n

THE EXTENDED ORDER AND POPULATION GROWTH

formerly able to maintain themselves are entirely fictional. Most
individuals who now make up the proletariat could not have existed
before others provided them with means to subsist. Although these folk
may feel exploited, and politicians may arouse and play on these feelings
to gain power, most of the Western proletariat, and most of the millions of
the developing world, owe their existence to opportunities that advanced
countries have created for them. All this is not confined to Western
countries or the developing world. Communist countries such as Russia
would be starving today if their populations were not kept alive by the
Western world - although the leaders of these countries would be hard put
to admit publicly that we can support the current population of the world,
including that of the communist countries, only if we maintain successfully
and improve the basis of private property which makes our extended order
possible.
Capitalism also introduced a new form of obtaining income from
production that liberates people in making them, and often their progeny
as well, independent of family groups or tribes. This is so even if
capitalism is sometimes prevented from providing all it might for those
who wish to take advantage of it by monopolies of organised groups of
workers, `unions', which create an artificial scarcity of their kind of
work by preventing those willing to do such work for a lower wage from
doing so.
The general advantage of replacing concrete particular purposes by
abstract rules manifests itself clearly in cases like these. Nobody
anticipated what was going to happen. Neither a conscious desire to
make the human species grow as fast as possible nor concern for
particular known lives produced that result. It was not always even
those who first initiated new practices (saving, private property, and
such like) whose physical offspring thus gained better chances of
surviving. For these practices do not preserve particular lives but rather
increase the chances (or prospects or probabilities) of more rapid
propagation of the group. Such results were no more desired than
foreseen. Some of these practices may indeed have involved a decrease
in esteem for some individual lives, a preparedness to sacrifice by
infanticide, to abandon the old and sick, or to kill the dangerous, in
order to improve the prospects of maintaining and multiplying the rest.
We can hardly claim that to increase mankind is good in some absolute
sense. We submit only that this effect, increase of particular populations
following particular rules, led to the selection of those practices whose
dominance has become the cause of further multiplication. (Nor, as we saw
in chapter one, is it suggested that developed morals that restrain and
suppress certain innate feelings should wholly displace these feelings.
Our inborn instincts are still important in our relations to our
i mmediate neighbours, and in certain other situations as well.)

THE EXTENDED ORDER AND POPULATION GROWTH

Yet if the market economy did indeed prevail over other types of
order because it enabled those groups that adopted its basic rules the
better to multiply, then the calculation in market values is a calculation in terms
of lives: i ndividuals guided by this calculation did what most helped to
increase their numbers, although this could hardly have been their
intention.

be affected, whereas the death of all females under forty-five would
destroy all possibility of preserving the strain.
But if for this reason all unknown lives must count equally in the
extended order - and in our own ideals we have closely approached this
aim so far as government action is concerned - this aim has never
governed behaviour in the small group or in our innate responses. Thus
one is led to raise the question of the morality or goodness of the
principle.
Yet, as with every other organism, the main `purpose' to which man's
physical make-up as well as his traditions are adapted is to produce
other human beings. In this he has succeeded amazingly, and his
conscious striving will have its most lasting effect only so far as, with or
without his knowledge, it contributes to this result. There is no real
point in asking whether those of his actions which do so contribute are
really `good', particularly if thus it is intended to inquire whether we like
the results. For, as we have seen, we have never been able to choose our
morals. Though there is a tendency to interpret goodness in a utilitarian
way, to claim that `good' is what brings about desired results, this claim
is neither true nor useful. Even if we restrict ourselves to common
usage, we find that the word `good' generally refers to what tradition
tells us we ought to do without knowing why - which is not to deny that
justifications are always being invented for particular traditions. We can
however perfectly well ask which among the many and conflicting rules
that tradition treats as good tend, under particular conditions, to
preserve and multiply those groups that follow them.

The Calculus of Costs Is a Calculus of Lives

Though the concept of a `calculus of lives' cannot be taken literally, it is
more than a metaphor. There may be no simple quantitative
relationships governing the preservation of human lives by economic
action, but the importance of the ultimate effects of market conduct can
hardly be overrated. Yet several qualifications have to be added. For
the most part, only unknown lives will count as so many units when it is
a question of sacrificing a few lives in order to serve a larger number
elsewhere.
Even if we do not like to face the fact, we constantly have to make
such decisions. Unknown individual lives, in public or private decisions,
are not absolute values, and the builder of motor roads or of hospitals or
electric equipment will never carry precautions against lethal accidents
to the maximum, because by avoiding costs this would cause elsewhere,
overall risks to human lives can be much reduced. When the army
surgeon after a battle engages in `triage' - when he lets one die who
might be saved, because in the time he would have to devote to saving
him he could save three other lives (see Hardin, 1980:59, who defines
`triage' as `the procedure which saves the maximum of lives') - he is
acting on a calculus of lives. This is another instance of how the
alternative between saving more or fewer lives shapes our views, even if
only as vague feelings about what ought to be done. The requirement of
preserving the maximum number of lives is not that all individual lives
be regarded as equally important. It may be more important to save the
life of the doctor, in our example above, than to save the lives of any
particular one of his patients: otherwise none might survive. Some lives
are evidently more important in that they create or preserve other lives.
The good hunter or defender of the community, the fertile mother and
perhaps even the wise old man may be more important than most
babies and most of the aged. On the preservation of the life of a good
chief large numbers of other lives may depend. And the highly
productive may be more valuable to the community than other adult
individuals. It is not the present number of lives that evolution will tend to
maximise but the prospective stream of future lives. If in a group all men of
fertile age, or all such women, and the required numbers to defend and
feed them, were preserved, the prospects of future growth would hardly
1 32

Life Has No Purpose But Itself

Life exists only so long as it provides for its own continuance. Whatever
men live for, today most live only because of the market order. We have
become civilised by the increase of our numbers just as civilisation
made that increase possible: we can be few and savage, or many and
civilised. If reduced to its population of ten thousand years ago,
mankind could not preserve civilisation. Indeed, even if knowledge
already gained were preserved in libraries, men could make little use of
it without numbers sufficient to fill the jobs demanded for extensive
specialisation and division of labour. All knowledge available in books
would not save ten thousand people spared somewhere after an atomic
holocaust from having to return to a life of hunters and gatherers,
although it would probably shorten the total amount of time that
humankind would have to remain in such a condition.
When people began to build better than they knew because they
began to subordinate concrete common goals to abstract rules that
enabled them to participate in a process of orderly collaboration that
133

NINE

THE FATAL CONCEIT

nobody could survey or arrange, and which no one could have
predicted, they created situations unintended and often undesired. We
may not like the fact that our rules were shaped mainly by their
suitability for increasing our numbers, but we have little choice in the
matter now (if we ever did), for we must deal with a situation that has
already been brought into being. So many people already exist; and
only a market economy can keep the bulk of them alive. Because of the
rapid transfer of information, men everywhere now know what high
standards of living are possible. Most of those who live in some more
thinly settled places can hope to reach such standards only by
multiplying and settling their regions more densely - so increasing even
further the numbers that can be kept alive by a market economy.
Since we can preserve and secure even our present numbers only by
adhering to the same general kinds of principles, it is our duty - unless
we truly wish to condemn millions to starvation - to resist the claims of
creeds that tend to destroy the basic principles of these morals, such as
the institution of several property.
In any case, our desires and wishes are largely irrelevant. Whether
we desire further increases of production and population or not, we must
- merely to maintain existing numbers and wealth, and to protect them
as best we can against calamity - strive after what, under favourable
conditions, will continue to lead, at least for some time, and in many
places, to further increases.

RELIGION AND THE GUARDIANS
OF TRADITION

Natural Selection from Among the Guardians of Tradition

While I have not intended to evaluate the issue whether, if we had
the choice, we would want to choose civilisation, examining issues of
population raises two relevant points. First, the spectre of a population
explosion that would make most lives miserable appears, as we have
seen, to be unfounded. Once this danger is removed, if one considers the
realities of `bourgeois' life - but not utopian demands for a life free of all
conflict, pain, lack of fulfilment, and, indeed, morality - one might think
the pleasures and stimulations of civilisation not a bad bargain for those
who do not yet enjoy them. But the question of whether we are better
off civilised than not is probably unanswerable in any final way through
such speculation. The second point is that the only thing close to an
objective assessment of the issue is to see what people do when they are
given the choice - as we are not. The readiness with which ordinary
people of the Third World - as opposed to Western-educated
intellectuals - appear to embrace the opportunities offered them by the
extended order, even if it means inhabiting for a time shanty towns at
the periphery, complements evidence regarding the reactions of
European peasants to the introduction of urban capitalism, indicating
that people will usually choose civilisation if they have the choice.

In closing this work, I would like to make a few informal remarks - they
are intended as no more than that - about the connection between the
argument of this book and the role of religious belief. These remarks
may be unpalatable to some intellectuals because they suggest that, in
their own long-standing conflict with religion, they were partly mistaken
- and very much lacking in appreciation.
This book has shown mankind as torn between two states of being.
On one hand are the kinds of attitudes and emotions appropriate to
behaviour in the small groups wherein mankind lived for more than a
hundred thousand years, wherein known fellows learnt to serve one
another, and to pursue common aims. Curiously, these archaic, more
primitive attitudes and emotions are now supported by much of
rationalism, and by the empiricism, hedonism, and socialism associated
with it. On the other hand there is the more recent development in
cultural evolution wherein we no longer chiefly serve known fellows or
pursue common ends, but where institutions, moral systems, and
traditions have evolved that have produced and now keep alive many
ti mes more people than existed before the dawn of civilisation, people
who are engaged, largely peacefully though competitively, in pursuing
thousands of different ends of their own choosing in collaboration with
thousands of persons whom they will never know.
How can such a thing have happened? How could traditions which
people do not like or understand, whose effects they usually do not
appreciate and can neither see nor foresee, and which they are still

13 4

135

THE FATAL CONCEIT

RELIGION AND THE GUARDIANS OF TRADITION

ardently combating, continue to have been passed on from generation to
generation?
Part of the answer is of course the one with which we began, the
evolution of moral orders through group selection: groups that behave
in these ways simply survive and increase. But this cannot be the whole
story. If not from an understanding of their beneficial effect in creating
an as-yet unimaginable extended order of cooperation, whence did such
rules of conduct originate? More important, how were they preserved
against the strong opposition of instinct and, more recently, from the
assaults of reason? Here we come to religion.
Custom and tradition, both non-rational adaptations to the environment, are more likely to guide group selection when supported by totem
and taboo, or magical or religious beliefs - beliefs that themselves grew
from the tendency to interpret any order men encountered in an
animistic manner. At first the main function of such restraints on
individual action may have been to serve as signs of recognition among
members of the group. Later the belief in spirits that punished
transgressors led such restraints to be preserved. `The spirits are in
general conceived as guardians of tradition.... Our ancestors live now
as spirits in the other world.... They become angry and make things
bad if we do not obey custom' (Malinowski, 1936:25).
But this is not yet sufficient for any real selection to occur, for such
beliefs and the rites and ceremonies associated with them must also
work on another level. Common practices must have a chance to
produce their beneficial effects on a group on a progressive scale before
selection by evolution can become effective. Meanwhile, how are they
transmitted from generation to generation? Unlike genetic properties,
cultural properties are not transmitted automatically. Transmission and
non-transmission from generation to generation are as much positive or
negative contributions to a stock of traditions as are any contributions
by individuals. Many generations will therefore probably be required to
ensure that any particular such traditions are indeed continued, and
that they do indeed eventually spread. Mythical beliefs of some sort
may be needed to bring this about, especially where rules of conduct
conflicting with instinct are concerned. A merely utilitarian or even
functionalist explanation of the different rites or ceremonies will be
insufficient, and even implausible.
We owe it partly to' mystical and religious beliefs, and, I believe,
particularly to the main monotheistic ones, that beneficial traditions
have been preserved and transmitted at least long enough to enable
those groups following them to grow, and to have the opportunity to
spread by natural or cultural selection. This means that, like it or not,
we owe the persistence of certain practices, and the civilisation that

resulted from them, in part to support from beliefs which are not true or verifiable or testable - in the same sense as are scientific statements,
and which are certainly not the result of rational argumentation. I
sometimes think that it might be appropriate to call at least some of
them, at least as a gesture of appreciation, `symbolic truths', since they
did help their adherents to `be fruitful and multiply and replenish the
earth and subdue it' ( Genesis 1:28). Even those among us, like myself,
who are not prepared to accept the anthropomorphic conception of a
personal divinity ought to admit that the premature loss of what we
regard as nonfactual beliefs would have deprived mankind of a powerful
support in the long development of the extended order that we now
enjoy, and that even now the loss of these beliefs, whether true or false,
creates great difficulties.
In any case, the religious view that morals were determined by
processes incomprehensible to us may at any rate be truer (even if not
exactly in the way intended) than the rationalist delusion that man, by
exercising his intelligence, invented morals that gave him the power to
achieve more than he could ever foresee. If we bear these things in
mind, we can better understand and appreciate those clerics who are
said to have become somewhat sceptical of the validity of some of their
teachings and who yet continued to teach them because they feared that
a loss of faith would lead to a decline of morals. No doubt they were
right; and even an agnostic ought to concede that we owe our morals,
and the tradition that has provided not only our civilisation but our
very lives, to the acceptance of such scientifically unacceptable factual
claims.
The undoubted historical connection between religion and the values
that have shaped and furthered our civilisation, such as the family and
several property, does not of course mean that there is any intrinsic
connection between religion as such and such values. Among the
founders of religions over the last two thousand years, many opposed
property and the family. But the only religions that have survived are those
which support property and the family. Thus the outlook for communism,
which is both anti-property and anti-family (and also anti-religion), is
not promising. For it is, I believe, itself a religion which had its time,
and which is now declining rapidly. In communist and socialist
countries we are watching how the natural selection of religious beliefs
disposes of the maladapted.

1 36

137

The decline of communism of which I speak is, of course, occurring mainly
where it has actually been implemented - and has therefore been allowed to
disappoint utopian hopes. It lives on, however, in the hearts of those who
have not experienced its real effects: in Western intellectuals and among the

THE FATAL CONCEIT

poor on the periphery of the extended order, i.e., in the Third World.
Among the former, there appears to be some growing sense that rationalism
of the type criticised here is a false god; but the need for a god of some sort
persists, and is met partly by such means as returning to a curious version of
Hegelian dialectic which allows the illusion of rationality to coexist with a
system of belief closed to criticism by unquestioned commitment to a
` humanist totality' (which, in fact, is itself supremely rationalistic in just the
constructivist sense I have criticised). As Herbert Marcuse put it, `Real
freedom for individual existence (and not merely in the liberalist sense) is
possible only in a specifically structured polls, a `rationally' organized
society' (quoted in Jay, 1973:119. To see what this `rationality' means, see
ibid., 49, 57 ) 60, 64, 81, 125, et passim). In the latter, `liberation theology'
may fuse with nationalism to produce a powerful new religion with disastrous
consequences for people already in dire economic straits (see O'Brien, 1 986).

How would religion have sustained beneficial customs? Customs
whose beneficial effects were unperceivable by those practising them
were likely to be preserved long enough to increase their selective
advantage only when supported by some other strong beliefs; and some
powerful supernatural or magic faiths were readily available to perform
this role. As an order of human interaction became more extended, and
still more threatening to instinctual claims, it might for a time become
quite dependent on the continuing influence of some such religious
beliefs - false reasons influencing men to do what was required to
maintain the structure enabling them to nourish their enlarging
numbers (see Appendix G).
But just as the very creation of the extended order was never
intended, similarly there is no reason to suppose that the support
derived from religion usually was deliberately cultivated, or that there
was often anything `conspiratorial' about all this. It is naive particularly in light of our argument that we cannot observe the effects of
our morals - to imagine some wise elite coolly calculating the effects of
various morals, selecting among them, and conspiring to persuade the
masses by Platonic `noble lies' to swallow an `opium of the people' and
thus to obey what advanced the interests of their rulers. No doubt
choice among particular. versions of basic religious beliefs was often
decided by expedient decisions of secular rulers. Moreover, religious
support was, from time to time, deliberately, sometimes even cynically,
enlisted by secular rulers; but frequently these would have concerned
momentary disputes that hardly counted for much over long evolutionary periods - periods wherein the question whether the favoured rule
contributed to the increase of the community was more decisive than
1 38

RELIGION AND THE GUARDIANS OF TRADITION

any question about what particular ruling clique may have coddled it
during some particular period.
Some questions of language may also arise in describing and evaluating
such developments. Ordinary language is inadequate to make the
necessary distinctions sufficiently precise, especially where the concept
of knowledge is concerned. For instance, is knowledge involved when a
person has the habit of behaving in a manner that, without his knowing
it, increases the likelihood that not only he and his family but also many
others unknown to him will survive - particularly if he has preserved
this habit for altogether different and indeed quite inaccurate grounds?
Obviously what guided him successfully is not what is generally meant
by rational knowledge. Nor is it helpful to describe such acquired
practices as `emotive' since they clearly are not always guided by what
may legitimately be called emotions either, even though certain factors,
such as fear of disapproval or punishment (whether human or divine),
may often support or preserve particular habits. In many if not most
cases, those who won through were those who stuck to `blind habit' or
learnt through religious teaching such things as that `honesty is the best
policy', thereby beating cleverer fellows who had `reasoned' otherwise.
As strategies for survival, counterparts of both rigidity and flexibility
have played important roles in biological evolution; and morals that
took the form of rigid rules may sometimes have been more effective
than more flexible rules whose adherents attempted to steer their
practice, and alter their course, according to particular facts and
foreseeable consequences - and thus by something that it would be
easier to call knowledge.
So far as I personally am concerned I had better state that I feel as little
entitled to assert as to deny the existence of what others call God, for I
must admit that I just do not know what this word is supposed to mean.
I certainly reject every anthropomorphic, personal, or animistic
interpretation of the term, interpretations through which many people
succeed in giving it a meaning. The conception of a man-like or mindlike acting being appears to me rather the product of an arrogant
overestimation of the capacities of a man-like mind. I cannot attach
meaning to words that in the structure of my own thinking, or in my
picture of the world, have no place that would give them meaning. It
would thus be dishonest of me were I to use such words as if they
expressed any belief that I hold.
I long hesitated whether to insert this personal note here, but
ultimately decided to do so because support by a professed agnostic
may help religious people more unhesitatingly to pursue those
139

THE FATAL CONCEIT

conclusions that we do share. Perhaps what many people mean in
speaking of God is just a personification of that tradition of morals or
values that keeps their community alive. The source of order that
religion ascribes to a human-like divinity - the map or guide that will
show a part successfully how to move within the whole - we now learn
to see to be not outside the physical world but one of its characteristics,
one far too complex for any of its parts possibly to form an `image' or
` picture' of it. Thus religious prohibitions against idolatry, against the
making of such images, are well taken. Yet perhaps most people can
conceive of abstract tradition only as a personal Will. If so, will they not
be inclined to find this will in `society' in an age in which more overt
supernaturalisms are ruled out as superstitions?
On that question may rest the survival of our civilisation.

APPENDICES

APPENDIX A

` NATURAL' VERSUS `ARTIFICIAL'

Current scientific and philosophical usage is so deeply influenced by the
Aristotelian tradition, which knows nothing of evolution, that existing
dichotomies and contrasts not only usually fail to capture correctly the
processes underlying the problems and conflicts discussed in chapter
one, but actually hinder understanding of those problems and conflicts
themselves. In this section I shall review some of these difficulties in
classification, in the hope that some familiarity with the obstacles to
understanding may in fact further understanding.
We may as well begin with the word `natural', the source of much
controversy and many misunderstandings. The original meaning of the
Latin root of `natural', as well as the Greek root of its equivalent
` physical', derive from verbs describing kinds of growth (nascor and phyo
respectively; see Kerferd, 1981:111-150), so that it would be legitimate
to describe as `natural' anything that has grown spontaneously and not
been deliberately designed by a mind. In this sense our traditional,
spontaneously evolved morals are perfectly natural rather than
artificial, and it would seem fitting to call such traditional rules `natural
law'.
But usage does not readily permit the understanding of natural law
that I have just sketched. Rather, it tends to confine the word `natural'
to innate propensities or instincts that (as we saw in chapter one) often
conflict with evolved rules of conduct. If such innate responses alone are
described as `natural', and if - to make matters worse - only what is
necessary to preserve an existing state of affairs, particularly the order
of the small group or immediate community, is described as `good', we
have to designate as both `unnatural' and `bad' even the first steps
taken towards observing rules and thereby adapting to changing
conditions - that is, the first steps towards civilisation.
Now if `natural' must be used to mean innate or instinctual, and
` artificial' to mean the product of design, the results of cultural
evolution (such as traditional rules) are clearly neither one nor the other
- and thus are not only `between instinct and reason', but also of course
between `natural' (i.e., instinctual) and `artificial' (i.e., the product of
reasonable design). The exclusive dichotomy of `natural' and `artificial',
1 43

THE FATAL CONCEIT

APPENDIX A

as well as the similar and related one of `passion' and `reason' - which,
being exclusive, does not permit any area between these terms - has
thus contributed greatly to the neglect and misunderstanding of the
crucial exosomatic process of cultural evolution which produced the
traditions that determined the growth of civilisation. In effect, these
dichotomies define this area, and these processes, out of existence.
Yet if we go beyond these crude dichotomies, we see that the true
opposite to passion is not reason but traditional morals. The evolution
of a tradition of rules of conduct - standing between the processes of the
evolution of instinct and those of reason - is a distinct process which it
is quite mistaken to regard as a product of reason. Such traditional rules
have indeed grown naturally in the course of evolution.
Growth is not an exclusive property of biological organisms. From the
proverbial snowball to the deposits of wind or the formation of crystals
- or waterborne sand, the rising of mountains and the formation of
complex molecules - nature is full of examples of increase of size or
structure. When we consider the emergence of structures of interrelations among organisms, we find that it is also perfectly correct,
etymologically and logically, to use the word `growth' to describe them;
and this is how I mean the word: namely, to designate a process
occurring in a self-maintaining structure.
Thus to continue to contrast cultural with natural evolution leads
back into the trap mentioned - the exclusive dichotomy between
` artificial' development guided by conscious design, and what is
assumed to be `natural' because it exhibits unchanging instinctual
characteristics. Such interpretations of `natural' easily force one in the
direction of constructivist rationalism. Though constructivist interpretations are no doubt superior to organismic `explanations' (now
generally rejected as empty) that merely substitute one unexplained
process for another, we should recognise that there are two distinct
kinds of evolutionary process - both of which are perfectly natural
processes. Cultural evolution, although a distinct process, remains in
i mportant respects more similar to genetic or biological evolution than
to developments guided by reason or foreknowledge of the effects of
decisions.
The similarity of the order of human interaction to that of biological
organisms has of course often been noticed. But so long as we were
unable to explain how the. orderly structures of nature were formed, as
long as we lacked an account of evolutionary selection, the analogies
perceived were of limited help. With evolutionary selection, however,
we are now supplied with a key to a general understanding of the
formation of order in life, mind and interpersonal relations.
Incidentally, some of those orders, like that of the mind, may be

capable of forming orders of a lower degree, yet are themselves not the
products of orders of a higher level. This teaches us to recognise our
li mited power of explaining or designing an order belonging to a lower
stage of the hierarchy of orders, as well as our inability to explain or
design one of a higher order.
Having stated the general problem that interferes with clear usage of
these traditional terms, we may as well indicate briefly, taking David
Hume as an example, how even the thought of one of the most
i mportant thinkers in our tradition has been plagued by misunderstandings arising from such false dichotomies. Hume is a particularly
good example since he unfortunately chose for the moral traditions that
I would really prefer to call natural the term `artificial' (probably
borrowing from the common-law writers' expression `artificial reason').
Ironically, this led to his being regarded as the founder of utilitarianism,
despite his having stressed that `though the rules of justice be artificial
they are not arbitrary', and that therefore it is even not `improper to call
them laws of nature' (1739/1886:11,258). He endeavoured to safeguard
himself against constructivistic misinterpretations by explaining that he
` only suppose[d] those reflections to be formed at once, which in fact
arise insensibly and by degrees' (1739/1886:11,274). (Hume made use
here of the device which Scottish moral philosophers called `conjectural
history' (Stewart, 1829:VII, 90, and Medick, 1973:134-176) - a device
later often called `rational reconstruction' - in a manner that may
mislead and which his younger contemporary Adam Ferguson learnt
systematically to avoid). As these passages suggest, Hume came close to
an evolutionary interpretation, even perceiving that `no form can persist
unless it possesses those powers and organs necessary for its
subsistence: some new order or economy must be tried and so on,
without intermission; till at last some order which can support and
maintain itself, is fallen upon'; and that man cannot `pretend to an
exemption from the lot of all living animals [because the] perpetual war
among all living creatures' must go on (1779/1886:11, 429, 436). As has
been well said, he practically recognised that `there is a third category
between natural and artificial which shares certain characteristics with
both' (Haakonssen, 1981:24).
Yet the temptation to try to explain the function of self-organising
structures by showing how such a structure might have been formed by
a creating mind is great; and it is thus understandable that some of
Hume's followers interpreted his term `artificial' in this way, building
on it a utilitarian theory of ethics according to which man consciously
chooses his morals for their recognised utility. This may seem a curious
view to ascribe to someone who had stressed that `the rules of morality
are not the conclusions of reason' (1739/1886:11, 235), but it was a

1 44

1 45

THE FATAL CONCEIT

APPENDIX A

misinterpretation that came naturally to a Cartesian rationalist such as
C. V. Helvetius, from whom Jeremy Bentham admittedly derived his
own constructions (see Everett, 1931:110).

much affected the development of research that a report of the 1980
meeting of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher and Arzte could say that
`for modern science of nature a world of things and phenomena has
become a world of structures and orders'.
Such recent advances in natural science have shown how right the
American scholar Simon N. Patten was when, nearly ninety years ago,
he wrote that `just as Adam Smith was the last of the moralists and the
first of the economists, so Darwin was the last of the economists and the
first of the biologists' (1899, XXIII). Smith proves to have been even
more than that: the paradigm he provided has since become a tool of
great power in many branches of scientific effort.
Nothing better illustrates the humanistic derivation of the concept of
evolution than that biology had to borrow its vocabulary from the
humanities. The term `genetic' that has now become perhaps the key
technical term for the theory of biological evolution was apparently first
used in its German form (genetisch) (Schulze, 1913:1, 242), in the writings
of J. G. Herder (1767), Friedrich Schiller (1793) and C. M. Wieland
(1800), long before Thomas Carlyle introduced it into English. It was
used particularly in linguistics after Sir William Jones had in 1787
discovered the common descent of the Indo-European languages;
and by the time that this had been elaborated in 1816 by Franz Bopp,
the conception of cultural evolution had become a commonplace. We
find the term used again in 1836 by Wilhelm von Humboldt (1977:111,
389 and 418), who in the same work also argued that `if one conceived
of the formation of language, as is most natural, as successive , it
becomes necessary to ascribe to it, as to all origin in nature, a system of
evolution' (with thanks to Professor R. Keller, Dusseldorf, for this
reference). Was it an accident that Humboldt was also a great advocate
of individual freedom? And after the publication of Charles Darwin's
work we find lawyers and linguists (aware of their kinship already in
ancient Rome (Stein, 1966: chapter 3)), protest that they had been
` Darwinians before Darwin' (Hayek, 1973:153). It was not until after
William Bateson's Problems of Genetics (1913) that `genetics' rapidly
became the distinctive name for biological evolution. Here we shall
adhere to its modern use, established by Bateson, for biological
inheritance through `genes', to distinguish it from cultural inheritance
through learning - which does not mean that the distinction can always
be carried through precisely. The two forms of inheritance frequently
interact, particularly by genetic inheritance determining what can or
cannot be inherited by learning (i.e., culturally).

Though in Hume, and also in the works of Bernard Mandeville, we can
watch the gradual emergence of the twin concepts of the formations of
spontaneous orders and of selective evolution (see Hayek, 1967/78:250,
1963/67:106-121 and 1967/78a:249-266), it was Adam Smith and
Adam Ferguson who first made systematic use of this approach. Smith's
work marks the breakthrough of an evolutionary approach which has
progressively displaced the stationary Aristotelian view. The nineteenth- century enthusiast who claimed that the Wealth of Nations was in
i mportance second only to the Bible has often been ridiculed; but he
may not have exaggerated so much. Even Aristotle's disciple Thomas
Aquinas could not conceal from himself that multae utilitates impedirentur
si omnia peccata districte prohiberentur - that much that is useful would be
prevented if all sins were strictly prohibited (Summa Theologica, II, ii, q.
78 i).
While Smith has been recognised by several writers as the originator
of cybernetics (Emmet, 1958:90, Hardin, 1961:54), recent examinations
of Charles Darwin's notebooks (Vorzimmer, 1977; Gruber, 1974)
suggest that his reading of Adam Smith in the crucial year 1838 led
Darwin to his decisive breakthrough.
Thus from the Scottish moral philosophers of the eighteenth century
stem the chief impulses towards a theory of evolution, the variety of
disciplines now known as cybernetics, general systems theory, synergetics, autopoiesis, etc., as well as the understanding of the superior selfordering power of the market system, and of the evolution also of
language, morals, and law (Ullman-Margalit, 1978, and Keller, 1982).
Adam Smith nevertheless remains the butt of jokes, even among
economists, many of whom have not yet discovered that the analysis of
self-ordering processes must be the chief task of any science of the
market order. Another great economist, Carl Menger, a little more than
a hundred years after Adam Smith, clearly perceived that `this genetic
element is inseparable from the conception of theoretical science'
( Menger, 1883/1933:11,183, and cf, his earlier use of the term `genetic'
in Menger, 1871/1934:1,250). It was largely through such endeavors to
understand the formation of human interaction through evolution and
spontaneous formation of order that these approaches have become the
main tools for dealing with such complex phenomena for the
explanation of which `mechanical laws' of one-directional causation are
no longer adequate (see Appendix B).
In recent years the spreading of this evolutionary approach has so

THE COMPLEXITY OF PROBLEMS OF
HUMAN INTERACTION

Although physical scientists sometimes appear unwilling to recognise
the greater complexity of the problems of human interaction, the fact
itself was seen more than a hundred years ago by no less a figure than
James Clerk Maxwell, who in 1877 wrote that the term `physical
science' is often applied `in a more or less restricted manner to those
branches of science in which the phenomena considered are of the
simplest and most abstract kind, excluding the consideration of the
more complex phenomena such as those observed in living things'. And
more recently a Nobel laureate in physics, Louis W. Alvarez, stressed
that `actually physics is the simplest of all the sciences.... But in the
case of an infinitely more complicated system, such as the population of
a developing country like India, no one can yet decide how best to
change the existing conditions' (Alvarez, 1968).
Mechanical methods and models of simple causal explanation are
increasingly inapplicable as we advance to such complex phenomena.
In particular, the crucial phenomena determining the formation of
many highly complex structures of human interaction, i.e., economic
values or prices, cannot be interpreted by simple causal or 'nomothetic'
theories, but require explanation in terms of the joint effects of a larger
number of distinct elements than we can ever hope individually to
observe or manipulate.
It was only the `marginal revolution' of the 1870s that produced a
satisfactory explanation of the market processes that Adam Smith had
long before described with his metaphor of the `invisible hand', an
account which, despite its still metaphorical and incomplete character,
was the first scientific description of such self-ordering processes. James
and John Stuart Mill, by contrast, were unable to conceive of the
determination of market values in any manner other than causal
determination by a few preceding events, and this inability barred
them, as it does many modern 'physicalists', from understanding selfsteering market processes. An understanding of the truths underlying
marginal utility theory was further delayed by James Mill's guiding
influence on David Ricardo, as well as by Karl Marx's own work.
Attempts to achieve mono-causal explanations in such areas (prolonged
14 8

APPENDIX B
even longer in England through the decisive influence of Alfred
Marshall and his school) persist to the present.
John Stuart Mill perhaps played the most important role in this
connection. He had early put himself under socialist influence, and
through this bias acquired a great appeal to `progressive' intellectuals,
establishing a reputation as the leading liberal and the `Saint of
Rationalism'. Yet he probably led more intellectuals into socialism than
any other single person: fabianism was in its beginnings essentially
formed by a group of his followers.
Mill had barred his way to comprehending the guide function of
prices by his doctrinaire assurance that `there is nothing in the laws of
value which remains for the present or any future writer to clear up'
(1848/1965, Works: III, 456), an assurance that made him believe that
` considerations of value had to do with [the distribution of wealth]
alone' and not with its production (1848/1965, Works, III: 455). Mill
was blinded to the function of prices by his assumption that only a
process of mechanical causation by some few observable preceding
events constituted a legitimate explanation in terms of the standards of
natural science. Due to the influence that Mill's assumption had exerted
for so long, the `marginal revolution' of twenty-five years later, when it
did arrive, had an explosive effect.
It deserves mentioning here, however, that only six years after Mill's
textbook was published, H. H. Gossen, a thinker who is almost wholly
overlooked, had anticipated marginal utility theory in already clearly
recognising the dependence of extended production on guidance by prices
and emphasising that `only with the establishment of private property can
the yardstick be found for the determination of the optimal quantity of each
commodity to be produced under given circumstances.... The greatest
possible protection of private property is definitely the greatest necessity for
the continuation of human society' (1854/1983:254-5).
Despite the great harm done by his work, we must probably forgive
Mill much for his infatuation with the lady who later became his wife upon whose death, in his opinion, `this country lost the greatest mind it
contained' and who, according to his testimony, `in the nobleness of her
public object ... never stopped short of perfect distributive justice as
the final aim, implying therefore a state of society entirely communist in
practice and spirit' (1965, Works: XV, 601; and see Hayek, 1951).
Whatever the influence of Mill may be, Marxian economics is still
today attempting to explain highly complex orders of interaction in
terms of single causal effects like mechanical phenomena rather than as
prototypes of those self-ordering processes which give us access to the
1 49

THE FATAL CONCEIT

explanation of highly complex phenomena. It deserves mention however
that, as Joachim Reig has pointed out (in his Introduction to the
Spanish translation of E. von Bohm-Bawerk's essay on Marx's theory of
exploitation (1976)), it would seem that after learning of the works of
Jevons and Menger, Karl Marx himself completely abandoned further
work on capital. If so, his followers were evidently not so wise as he.

APPENDIX C

TIME AND THE EMERGENCE AND
REPLICATION OF STRUCTURES

The fact that certain structures can form and multiply because other
similar structures that already exist can transmit their properties to
others (subject to occasional variations), and that abstract orders can
thus undergo a process of evolution in the course of which they pass
from one material embodiment into others that will arise only because
the pattern already exists, has given our world a new dimension: time's
arrow (Blum, 1951). In the course of time new features arise which did
not exist before: self-perpetuating and evolving structures which, though
represented at any one moment only by particular material embodiments, become distinct entities that in various manifestations persist
through time.
The possibility of forming structures by a process of replication gives
those elements that have the capacity for doing so better chances of
multiplying. Those elements will be preferably selected for multiplication that are capable of forming into more complex structures, and
the increase of their members will lead to the formation of still more
such structures. Such a model, once it has appeared, becomes as
definite a constituent of the order of the world as any material object. In
the structures of interaction, the patterns of activities of groups are
determined by practices transmitted by individuals of one generation to
those of the next; and these orders preserve their general character only
by constant change (adaptation).

APPENDIX D

ALIENATION, DROPOUTS, AND THE
CLAIMS OF PARASITES

In this section I should like to record a few reflections about the matters
named in the title of this section.
1. As we have seen, conflict between an individual's emotions and
what is expected of him in an extended order is virtually inevitable:
innate responses tend to break through the network of learnt rules that
maintain civilisation. But only Rousseau provided literary and intell ectual credentials for reactions that cultivated people once dismissed
as simply uncouth. Regarding the natural (read `instinctual') as good or
desirable is, in his work, an expression of nostalgia for the simple, the
primitive, or even the barbarian, based on the conviction that one ought
to satisfy his or her desires, rather than to obey shackles allegedly
invented and imposed by selfish interests.
In a milder form, disappointment at the failure of our traditional
morality to produce greater pleasure has recently found expression in
nostalgia for the small that is beautiful, or in complaints about The
joyless Economy (Schumacher, 1973, Scitovsky, 1976, as well as much of
the literature of `alienation').
2. Mere existence cannot confer a right or moral claim on anyone
against any other. Persons or groups may incur duties to particular
individuals; but as part of the system of common rules that assist
humankind to grow and multiply not even all existing lives have a
moral claim to preservation. A practice that seems so harsh to us
wherein some Eskimo tribes leave senile members to die at the
beginning of their seasonal migration may well be necessary for them to
bring their offspring to the next season. And it is at least an open
question whether it is a moral duty to prolong the lives of suffering
incurables as long as modern medicine can. Such questions arise even
before we ask to whom such claims can be validly addressed.
Rights derive from systems of relations of which the claimant has
become a part through helping to maintain them. If he ceases to do so,
or has never done so (or nobody has done so for him) there exists no
ground on which such claims could be founded. Relations between
1 52

APPENDIX D

individuals can exist only as products of their wills, but the mere wish of
a claimant can hardly create a duty for others. Only expectations
produced by long practice can create duties for the members of the
community in which they prevail, which is one reason why prudence
must be exercised in the creation of expectations, lest one incur a duty
that one cannot fulfill.
3. Socialism has taught many people that they possess claims
irrespective of performance, irrespective of participation. In the light of
the morals that produced the extended order of civilisation, socialists in
fact incite people to break the law.
Those who claim to have been `alienated' from what most of them
apparently never learnt, and who prefer to live as parasitic dropouts,
draining the products of a process to which they refuse to contribute,
are true followers of Rousseau's appeal for a return to nature,
representing as the chief evil those institutions that made possible the
formation of an order of human coordination.
I do not question any individual's right voluntarily to withdraw from
civilisation. But what `entitlements' do such persons have? Are we to
subsidise their hermitages? There cannot be any entitlement to be
exempted from the rules on which civilisation rests. We may be able to
assist the weak and disabled, the very young and old, but only if the
sane and adult submit to the impersonal discipline which gives us
means to do so.
It would be quite wrong to regard such errors as originating with the
young. They reflect what they are taught, the pronouncements of their
parents - and of departments of psychology and sociology of education
and the characteristic intellectuals whom they produce - pale
reproductions of Rousseau and Marx, Freud and Keynes, transmitted
through intellects whose desires have outrun their understanding.

PLAY, THE SCHOOL OF RULES

REMARKS ON THE ECONOMICS AND
ANTHROPOLOGY OF POPULATION

The practices that led to the formation of the spontaneous order have
much in common with rules observed in playing a game. To attempt to
trace the origin of competition in play would lead us too far astray, but
we can learn much from the masterly and revealing analysis of the role
of play in the evolution of culture by the historian Johan Huizinga,
whose work has been insufficiently appreciated by students of human
order (1949: esp. 5, 11, 24, 47, 51, 59, and 100, and see Knight,
1923/1936:46, 50, 60-66; and Hayek, 1976:71 and n. 10).
Huizinga writes that `in myth and ritual the great instinctive forces of
civilised life have their origin: law and order, commerce and profit, craft
and art, poetry, wisdom and science. All are rooted in the primaeval soil
of play' (1949:5); play `creates order, is order' (1950:10)	
It proceeds
within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed
rules and in an orderly manner' (1949:15 and 51).
A game is indeed a clear instance of a process wherein obedience to
common rules by elements pursuing different and even conflicting
purposes results in overall order. Modern game theory has, moreover,
shown that while some games lead to the gains of one side being evenly
balanced by the gains of the other, other games may produce overall net
gain. The growth of the extended structure of interaction was made
possible by the individual's entry into the latter sorts of game, ones
leading to overall increase of productivity.

The matters discussed in chapter eight have concerned economics from
its origins. The science of economics may well be said to have begun in
1 681, when Sir William Petty (a slightly older colleague of Sir Isaac
Newton, and among the founders of the Royal Society) became
fascinated by the causes of the rapid growth of London. To everybody's
surprise he found that it had grown bigger than Paris and Rome
together, and in an essay on The Growth, Increase and Multiplication of
Mankind he explained how greater density of population made a greater
division of labour possible:

154

Each manufacture will be divided in as many parts as possible. In the
making of a watch, if one man shall make the wheels, another the spring,
another shall engrave the dial plate, then the watch will be better and
cheaper than if the same work were put on any one man.
And we also see that in towns and in the streets of great towns, where all
the inhabitants are almost of one trade, the commodity peculiar to those
places is made better and cheaper than elsewhere. Moreover, when all sorts
of manufacture are made in one place, there every ship that goes forth can
suddenly have its loading of so many particulars and species as the port
whereunto she is bound can take off (1681/1899:II, 453 and 473).
Petty also recognised that 'fewness of people, is real poverty; and a
Nation wherein are Eight Millions of people are more than twice as rich
as the same scope of land wherein are but four; For the Governors
which are the great charge, may serve near as well for the greater as the
lesser number' (1681/1899:11, 454-55, and 1927:11, 48). Unfortunately,
the special essay he wrote on `The Multiplication of Mankind' appears
to be lost (1681/1899:1, 454-55 and 1927:1, 43), but it is evident that
the general conception was transmitted from him through Bernard
Mandeville (1715/1924:1, 356) to Adam Smith, who noticed, as
remarked in chapter eight, that division of labour is limited by the
extent of the market, and that population increase is crucial to the
prosperity of a country.
If economists have from an early date been preoccupied with such
1 55

THE FATAL CONCEIT

questions, anthropologists in recent times have given insufficient
attention to the evolution of morals (which of course can scarcely ever
be `observed'); and not only the crudities of social Darwinism but also
socialist prejudices have discouraged the pursuit of evolutionary
approaches. Nevertheless we find an eminent socialist anthropologist, in
a study of `Urban Revolution', define `revolution' as `the culmination of
the progressive change in the economic structure and social organisation of communities that caused, or was accompanied by, a dramatic
increase of the population affected' (Childe, 1950:3). Important insights
are also found in the writings of M. J. Herskovits, who states:
The relation of population size to environment and technology on the one
hand, and to per capita production on the other, offers the greatest challenge
in investigating the combinations which make for an economic surplus
among a given people....
On the whole it seems that the problem of survival is most pressing in the
smallest societies. Conversely, it is among the larger groups, where the
specialisation appears which is essential in providing more goods than are
sufficient to support all people, that the enjoyment of social leisure is made
possible (1960:398).
What is often represented by biologists (e.g., Carr-Saunders, 1922,
Wynne-Edwards, 1962, Thorpe, 1976) as primarily a mechanism for
li miting population might equally well be described as a mechanism for
increasing, or better for adapting, numbers to a long-run equilibrium to
the supporting power of the territory, taking as much advantage of new
possibilities to maintain larger numbers as of any damage which a
temporary excess might cause. Nature is as inventive in the one respect
as in the other, and the human brain was probably the most successful
structure enabling one species to outgrow all others in power and
extent.

APPENDIX G

SUPERSTITION AND THE PRESERVATION
OF TRADITION

This volume was nearly ready for the printers when a friendly comment
by Dr. D. A. Rees on a lecture I had given drew my attention to a
remarkable little study by Sir James Frazer (1909) - Psyche's Task bearing the subtitle given above. In it, as Frazer explained, he
endeavoured to `sort out the seeds of good from the seeds of evil'. It
deals with my central subject in a manner in many respects similar, but,
coming as it does from a distinguished anthropologist, it is able to give,
particularly on the early development of property and the family, so
much more empirical evidence that I wish I could reprint the whole of
its 84 pages as an illustrative appendix to this volume. Among those of
his conclusions which are pertinent to this volume, he explains how
superstition, by strengthening respect for marriage, contributed to
stricter observance of rules of sexual morality among both married and
unmarried. In his chapter on private property (17), Frazer points out
that `the effect of tabooing a thing [was] to endow it with a supernatural
or magical energy that rendered it practically unapproachable by any
but the owner. Thus taboo became a powerful instrument for
strengthening the ties, perhaps our socialist friends would say riveting
the chains, of private property'. And later (19), he quotes a much
earlier author who reports that in New Zealand a `form of tapu was a
great preserver of property', and an even earlier report (20) about the
Marquand Islands where `without doubt the first mission of taboo was
to establish property the basis of all society'.
Frazer also concluded (82) that `superstition rendered a great service
to humanity. It supplied multitudes with a motive, a wrong motive it is
true, for right action; and surely it is better for the world that men
should be right from wrong motives than that they would do wrong
with the best intentions. What concerns society is conduct, not opinion:
if only our actions are just and good, it matters not a straw to others
whether our opinions are mistaken'.
