Introduction by Mihnea Moldoveanu, Rotman School of Management, University
of Toronto, CAN
Friedrich Hayek's The Theory of Complex Phenomena (Hayek, 1964) is a precocious and far-sighted
attempt to illuminate a topic that has loomed increasingly important in the 53 years since the printing of
the paper: the epistemology of complexity. It posits a tension between real insight into complex
phenomena and a narrow - but, common-interpretation of a Popperian falsificationism, and suggests
that we make a 'hard choice' - one that subsequent research and philosophical forays into complexity
science can be usefully understood as having implicitly made on numerous occasions.
Popper suggested actual falsifiability of hypotheses derived from a theory as a criterion of demarcation
between scientific and 'metaphysical' or 'pseudo-scientific' theories and of choice among alternative
empirical theories (Popper, 1959). Thus, the 'theory' which states that 'the orbit of planet Z has the form
of a circle, i.e, x^sup 2^ y^sup 2^=R2' is to be preferred (before testing) to a theory which states that
'the orbit of planet Z has the form of an ellipse, i.e., a^sup 2^x2 b^sup 2^y^sup 2^=c^sup 2^ because it
takes fewer points - or, measurements (namely, 3) to disconfirm the former theory than it takes (4) to
disconfirm the latter. Popper capitalizes on the example to make the point that the (normative)
emphasis placed by some philosophers of science on simplicity as a criterion for theory choice follows
from (and is therefore not independent of) a commitment to actual falsifiability.
This is precisely the point that Hayek focuses on, in reference to 'complex phenomena'. He sees that the
astute researcher of complexity faces a hard choice between the 'point-wise' testability that Popper
takes for granted on the one hand, and insight or understanding on the other - and advocates that the
constraints which testability places on theory choice be loosened in favor of allowing for more
complicated nomological relationships among independent variables, which, in turn, will orient the
empiricist away from attempting to predict point events and towards predicting 'patterns' or dynamical
regimes. This is a precocious and far sighted insight, and here is a case in point: Apparently
unbeknownst to Hayek (plausibly so: Hayek finished the paper in 1961, two years before the Lorenz
paper that kicked off 'chaos theory' was published), chaos theory got off the ground approximately at
the same time Hayek was writing his paper, starting from (Edward) Lorenz's startling realization that
some dynamical systems (such as that made up by the coupling between the system of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations he was trying to solve numerically and the finite-precision arithmetic
operations that his computer instantiated) exhibit highly sensitive dependence of their long-run
dynamics on their initial conditions, such that two points in the phase space of the system that start out
arbitrarily close together will - in the course of the system's evolution and after an only finite amount of
time - end up very far apart. 'Chaos theory', then, touches reality not by making predictions about point
events, but, rather, by specifying dynamical systems and regimes or regions of their parameter spaces
that exhibit 'transition to chaos' (Ott, 2002) - that is, by making predictions about patterns of behavior
rather than about highly localized space-time hyper-volumes ('points') of behavior.

But, is the development of an empirical chaos theory really a validation of Hayek's claim that strict
falsificationism must be relaxed in order to make progress on a science of complexity? Note, in this
regard, that formal languages used for representing dynamical systems (such as those exhibiting chaotic
behavior) come equipped with highly efficacious state space contraction devices and maneuvers, which
collapse half-planes into lines and lines into points. It is, then, possible - by the application of such
devices - to render predictions about macroscopic patterns and dynamical regimes of behavior into
predictions about the 'rate of transition to chaos and boundaries between ordered and disordered
behavior, which make possible precisely the kind of subsequent 'point- wise testing' that Popper is often
interpreted as having had in mind. Doing so, however, will presuppose a flexibility on the part of the
researcher at a level which most social scientists in general and economists trained in the neoclassical
tradition in particular have to date had little consideration for: the ontological one - a flexibility about
the objects in-terms-of-which discourse proceeds. This is something that Hayek glimpses and points the
way to his paper, without fully calling out: 'statistics' - he argues - cannot be used to teach us much
about a population of computers, unless we also have access to the code that runs on them (Hayek,
1961, ibid.). Knowledge of the code used to design the computers will not only give us a radically
different number and set of hypotheses that 'statistics' can be used to test, but also, perhaps more
importantly, a different conceptualization of the 'computer' in terms of 'intentional' terms ('algorithms')
rather than in terms of causal entities ('electrons and holes'). And this may be a far more penetrating
insight of Hayek's paper than is the exhortation to loosen the epistemological constraints that we place
on 'complexity science' - and one which complexity researchers may do well to heed. Should they
choose to do so, the black box of human decision making (mind [arrow right] brain [arrow right]
behavior) - neatly bracketed in economic analyses by rational choice models and linear demand
functions - could be made to yield much illuminating insight under the gaze of new conceptual toolkits.

The Theory of Complex Phenomena: A Precocious Play on the Epistemology of
Complexity

1. Pattern Precognition and Pattern Prediction
Man has been impelled to scientific inquiry by wonder and by need. Of these wonder has been
incomparably more fertile. There are good reasons for this. Where we wonder we have already a
question to ask. But however urgently we may want to find our way in what appears just chaotic, so
long as we do not know what to look for, even the most attentive and persistent observation of the bare
facts is not likely to make them more intelligible. Intimate acquaintance with the facts is certainly
important ; but systematic observation can start only after problems have arisen. Until we have definite
questions to ask we cannot employ our intellect; and questions presuppose that we have formed some
provisional hypothesis or theory about the events.1
Questions will arise at first only after our senses have discerned some recurring pattern or order in the
events. It is a re-cognition of some regularity (or recurring pattern, or order), of some similar feature in
otherwise different circumstances, which makes us wonder and ask 'why?'2 Our minds are so made that
when we notice such regularity in diversity we suspect the presence of the same agent and become
curious to detect it. It is to this trait of our minds that we owe whatever understanding and mastery of
our environment we have achieved.
Many such regularities of nature are recognized 'intuitively' by our senses. We see and hear patterns as
much as individual events without having to resort to intellectual operations. In many instances these
patterns are of course so much part of the environment which we take for granted that they do not cause
questions. But where our senses show us new patterns, this causes surprise and questioning. To such
curiosity we owe the beginning of science.
Marvelous, however, as the intuitive capacity of our senses for pattern recognition is, it is still limited.3
Only certain kinds of regular arrangements (not necessarily the simplest) obtrude themselves on our
senses. Many of the patterns of nature we can discover only after they have been constructed by our
mind. The systematic construction of such new patterns is the business of mathematics.4 The role
which geometry plays in this respect with regard to some visual patterns is merely the most familiar
instance of this. The great strength of mathematics is that it enables us to describe abstract patterns
which cannot be perceived by our senses, and to state the common properties of hierarchies or classes
of patterns of a highly abstract character. Every algebraic equation or set of such equations defines in
this sense a class of patterns, with the individual manifestation of this kind of pattern being
particularized as we substitute definite values for the variables.
It is probably the capacity of our senses spontaneously to recognize certain kinds of patterns that has
led to the erroneous belief that if we look only long enough, or at a sufficient number of instances of
natural events, a pattern will always reveal itself. That this often is so means merely that in those cases
the theorizing has been done already by our senses. Where, however, we have to deal with patterns for
the development of which there has been no biological reason, we shall first have to invent the pattern
before we can discover its presence in the phenomena-or before we shall be able to test its applicability
to what we observe. A theory will always define only a kind (or class) of patterns, and the particular
manifestation of the pattern to be expected will depend on the particular circumstances (the 'initial and
marginal conditions' to which, for the purposes of this article, we shall refer as 'data'). How much in
fact we shall be able to predict will depend on how many of those data we can ascertain.

The description of the pattern which the theory provides is commonly regarded merely as a tool which
will enable us to predict the particular manifestations of the pattern that will appear in specific
circumstances. But the prediction that in certain general conditions a pattern of a certain kind will
appear is also a significant (and falsifiable) prediction. If I tell somebody that if he goes to my study he
will find there a rug with a pattern made up of diamonds and meanders, he will have no difficulty in
deciding 'whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result',5 even though I have said
nothing about the arrangement, size, colour, etc., of the elements from which the pattern of the rug is
formed.
The distinction between a prediction of the appearance of a pattern of a certain class and a prediction of
the appearance of a particular instance of this class is sometimes important even in the physical
sciences. The mineralogist who states that the crystals of a certain mineral are hexagonal, or the
astronomer who assumes that the course of a celestial body in the field of gravity of another will
correspond to one of the conic sections, make significant predictions which can be refuted. But in
general the physical sciences tend to assume that it will in principle always be possible to specify their
predictions to any degree desired.6 The distinction assumes, however, much greater importance when
we turn from the relatively simple phenomena with which the natural sciences deal, to the more
complex phenomena of life, of mind, and of society, where such specifications may not always be
possible.7
2. Degrees of Complexity
The distinction between simplicity and complexity raises considerable philosophical difficulties when
applied to statements. But there seems to exist a fairly easy and adequate way to measure the degree of
complexity of different kinds of abstract patterns. The minimum number of elements of which an
instance of the pattern must consist in order to exhibit all the characteristic attributes of the class of
patterns in question appears to provide an unambiguous criterion.
It has occasionally been questioned whether the phenomena of life, of mind, and of society are really
more complex than those of the physical world.8 This seems to be largely due to a confusion between
the degree of complexity characteristic of a peculiar kind of phenomenon and the degree of complexity
to which, by a combination of elements, any kind of phenomenon can be built up. Of course, in this
manner physical phenomena may achieve any degree of complexity. Yet when we consider the question
from the angle of the minimum number of distinct variables a formula or model must possess in order
to reproduce the characteristic patterns of structures of different fields (or to exhibit the general laws
which these structures obey), the increasing complexity as we proceed from the inanimate to the ('more
highly organized') animate and social phenomena becomes fairly obvious.
It is, indeed, surprising how simple in these terms, i.e., in terms of the number of distinct variables,
appear all the laws of physics, and particularly of mechanics, when we look through a collection of
formulae expressing them.9 On the other hand, even such relatively simple constituents of biological
phenomena as feedback (or cybernetic) systems, in which a certain combination of physical structures
produces an overall structure possessing distinct characteristic properties, require for their description
something much more elaborate than anything describing the general laws of mechanics. In fact, when
we ask ourselves by what criteria we single out certain phenomena as 'mechanical' or 'physical', we
shall probably find that these laws are simple in the sense defined. Non-physical phenomena are more
complex because we call physical what can be described by relatively simple formulae.
The 'emergence' of 'new' patterns as a result of the increase in the number of elements between which
simple relations exist, means that this larger structure as a whole will possess certain general or abstract
features which will recur independently of the particular values of the individual data, so long as the

general structure (as described, e.g., by an algebraic equation) is preserved.10 Such 'wholes', defined in
terms of certain general properties of their structure, will constitute distinctive objects of explanation
for a theory, even though such a theory may be merely a particular way of fitting together statements
about the relations between the individual elements.
It is somewhat misleading to approach this task mainly from the angle of whether such structures are
'open' or 'closed' systems. There are, strictly speaking, no closed systems within the universe. All we
can ask is whether in the particular instance the points of contact through which the rest of the universe
acts upon the system we try to single out (and which for the theory become the data) are few or many.
These data, or variables, which determine the particular form which the pattern described by the theory
will assume in the given circumstances, will be more numerous in the case of complex wholes and
much more difficult to ascertain and control than in the case of simple phenomena.
What we single out as wholes, or where we draw the 'partition boundary',11 will be determined by the
consideration whether we can thus isolate recurrent patterns of coherent structures of a distinct kind
which we do in fact encounter in the world in which we live. Many complex patterns which are
conceivable and might recur we shall not find it worthwhile to construct. Whether it will be useful to
elaborate and study a pattern of a particular kind will depend on whether the structure it describes is
persistent or merely accidental. The coherent structures in which we are mainly interested are those in
which a complex pattern has produced properties which make self-maintaining the structure showing it.
3. Pattern Prediction with Incomplete Data
The multiplicity of even the minimum of distinct elements required to produce (and therefore also of
the minimum number of data required to explain) a complex phenomenon of a certain kind creates
problems which dominate the disciplines concerned with such phenomena and gives them an
appearance very different from that of those concerned with simpler phenomena. The chief difficulty in
the former becomes one of in fact ascertaining all the data determining a particular manifestation of the
phenomenon in question, a difficulty which is often insurmountable in practice and sometimes even an
absolute one.12 Those mainly concerned with simple phenomena are often inclined to think that where
this is the case a theory is useless and that scientific procedure demands that we should find a theory of
sufficient simplicity to enable us to derive from it predictions of particular events. To them the theory,
the knowledge of the pattern, is merely a tool whose usefulness depends entirely on our capacity to
translate it into a representation of the circumstances producing a particular event. Of the theories of
simple phenomena this is largely true.13
There is, however, no justification for the belief that it must always be possible to discover such simple
regularities and that physics is more advanced because it has succeeded in doing this while other
sciences have not yet done so. It is rather the other way round : physics has succeeded because it deals
with phenomena which, in our sense, are simple. But a simple theory of phenomena which are in their
nature complex (or one which, if that expression be preferred, has to deal with more highly organized
phenomena) is probably merely of necessity false-at least without a specified ceteris paribus
assumption, after the full statement of which the theory would no longer be simple.
We are, however, interested not only in individual events, and it is also not only predictions of
individual events which can be empirically tested. We are equally interested in the recurrence of
abstract patterns as such; and the prediction that a pattern of a certain kind will appear in defined
circumstances is a falsifiable (and therefore empirical) statement. Knowledge of the conditions in
which a pattern of a certain kind will appear, and of what depends on its preservation, may be of great
practical importance. The circumstances or conditions in which the pattern described by the theory will
appear are defined by the range of values which may be inserted for the variables of the formula. All

we need to know in order to make such a theory applicable to a situation is, therefore, that the data
possess certain general properties (or belong to the class defined by the scope of the variables). Beyond
this we need to know nothing about their individual attributes so long as we are content to derive
merely the sort of pattern that will appear and not its particular manifestation.
Such a theory destined to remain 'algebraic',14 because we are in fact unable to substitute particular
values for the variables, ceases then to be a mere tool and becomes the final result of our theoretical
efforts. Such a theory will, of course, in Popper's terms,15 be one of small empirical content, because it
enables us to predict or explain only certain general features of a situation which may be compatible
with a great many particular circumstances. It will perhaps enable us to make only what M. Scriven has
called 'hypothetical predictions',16 i.e., predictions dependent on yet unknown future events; in any case
the range of phenomena compatible with it will be wide and the possibility of falsifying it
correspondingly small. But as in many fields this will be for the present, or perhaps forever, all the
theoretical knowledge we can achieve, it will nevertheless extend the range of the possible advance of
scientific knowledge.
The advance of science will thus have to proceed in two different directions : while it is certainly
desirable to make our theories as falsifiable as possible, we must also push forward into fields where,
as we advance, the degree of falsifiability necessarily decreases. This is the price we have to pay for an
advance into the field of complex phenomena.
4. Statistics Impotent to Deal with Pattern Complexity
Before we further illustrate the use of those mere 'explanations of the principle'17 provided by 'algebraic'
theories which describe only the general character of higher-level generalities, and before we consider
the important conclusions which follow from the insight into the boundaries of possible knowledge
which our distinction provides, it is necessary to turn aside and consider the method which is often, but
erroneously, believed to give us access to the understanding of complex phenomena: statistics. Because
statistics is designed to deal with large numbers it is often thought that the difficulty arising from the
large number of elements of which complex structures consist can be overcome by recourse to
statistical techniques.
Statistics, however, deals with the problem of large numbers essentially by eliminating complexity and
deliberately treating the individual elements which it counts as if they were not systematically
connected. It avoids the problem of complexity by substituting for the information on the individual
elements information on the frequency with which their different properties occur in classes of such
elements, and it deliberately disregards the fact that the relative position of the different elements in a
structure may matter. In other words, it proceeds on the assumption that information on the numerical
frequencies of the different elements of a collective is enough to explain the phenomena and that no
information is required on the manner in which the elements are related. The statistical method is
therefore of use only where we either deliberately ignore, or are ignorant of, the relations between the
individual elements with different attributes, i.e., where we ignore or are ignorant of any structure into
which they are organized. Statistics in such situations enables us to regain simplicity and to make the
task manageable by substituting a single attribute for the unascertainable individual attributes in the
collective. It is, however, for this reason irrelevant to the solution of problems in which it is the
relations between individual elements with different attributes which matters.
Statistics might assist us where we had information about many complex structures of the same kind,
that is, where the complex phenomena and not the elements of which they consist could be made the
elements of the statistical collective. It may provide us, e.g., with information on the relative frequency
with which particular properties of the complex structures, say of the members of a species of

organisms, occur together; but it presupposes that we have an independent criterion for identifying
structures of the kind in question. Where we have such statistics about the properties of many
individuals belonging to a class of animals, or languages, or economic systems, this may indeed be
scientifically significant information.18
How little statistics can contribute, however, even in such cases, to the explanation of complex
phenomena is clearly seen if we imagine that computers were natural objects which we found in
sufficiently large numbers and whose behaviour we wanted to predict. It is clear that we should never
succeed in this unless we possessed the mathematical knowledge built into the computers, that is,
unless we knew the theory determining their structure. No amount of statistical information on the
correlation between input and output would get us any nearer our aim. Yet the efforts which are
currently made on a large scale with regard to the much more complex structures which we call
organisms are of the same kind. The belief that it must be possible in this manner to discover by
observation regularities in the relations between input and output without the possession of an
appropriate theory in this case appears even more futile and na�ve than it would be in the case of the
computers.19
While statistics can successfully deal with complex phenomena where these are the elements of the
population on which we have information, it can tell us nothing about the structure of these elements. It
treats them, in the fashionable phrase, as 'black boxes' which are presumed to be of the same kind but
about whose identifying characteristics it has nothing to say. Nobody would probably seriously contend
that statistics can elucidate even the comparatively not very complex structures of organic molecules,
and few would argue that it can help us to explain the functioning of organisms. Yet when it comes to
accounting for the functioning of social structures, that belief is widely held. It is here of course largely
the product of a misconception about what the aim of a theory of social phenomena is, which is another
story.
5 . The Theory of Evolution as an Instance of Pattern Prediction
Probably the best illustration of a theory of complex phenomena which is of great value, although it
describes merely a general pattern whose detail we can never fill in, is the Darwinian theory of
evolution by natural selection. It is significant that this theory has always been something of a
stumbling block for the dominant conception of scientific method. It certainly does not fit the orthodox
criteria of 'prediction and control' as the hallmarks of scientific method.20 Yet it cannot be denied that it
has become the successful foundation of a great part of modern biology.
Before we examine its character we must clear out of the way a widely held misconception as to its
content. It is often represented as if it consisted of an assertion about the succession of particular
species of organisms which gradually changed into each other. This, however, is not the theory of
evolution but an application of the theory to the particular events which took place on Earth during the
last two billion years or so.21 Most of the misapplications of evolutionary theory (particularly in
anthropology and the other social sciences) and its various abuses (e.g., in ethics) are due to this
erroneous interpretation of its content.
The theory of evolution by natural selection describes a kind of process (or mechanism) which is
independent of the particular circumstances in which it has taken place on Earth, which is equally
applicable to a course of events in very different circumstances, and which might result in the
production of an entirely different set of organisms. The basic conception of the theory is exceedingly
simple and it is only in its application to the concrete circumstances that its extraordinary fertility and
the range of phenomena for which it can account manifests itself.22 The basic proposition which has
this far-reaching implication is that a mechanism of reduplication with transmittable variations and

competitive selection of those which prove to have a better chance of survival will in the course of time
produce a great variety of structures adapted to continuous adjustment to the environment and to each
other. The validity of this general proposition is not dependent on the truth of the particular applications
which were first made of it: if, for example, it should have turned out that, in spite of their structural
similarity, man and ape were not joint descendants from a comparatively near common ancestor but
were the product of two convergent strands starting from ancestors which differed much more from
each other (such as is true of the externally very similar types of marsupial and placental carnivores),
this would not have refuted Darwin's general theory of evolution but only the manner of its application
to the particular case.
The theory as such, as is true of all theories, describes merely a range of possibilities. In doing this it
excludes other conceivable courses of events and thus can be falsified. Its empirical content consists in
what it forbids.23 If a sequence of events should be observed which cannot be fitted into its pattern,
such as, e.g., that horses suddenly should begin to give birth to young with wings, or that the cutting off
of a hind-paw in successive generations of dogs should result in dogs being born without that hind-paw,
we should regard the theory as refuted.24
The range of what is permitted by the theory is undeniably wide. Yet one could also argue that it is only
the limitation of our imagination which prevents us from being more aware of how much greater is the
range of the prohibited - how infinite is the variety of conceivable forms of organisms which, thanks to
the theory of evolution, we know will not in the foreseeable future appear on Earth. Commonsense may
have told us before not to expect anything widely different from what we already knew. But exactly
what kinds of variations are within the range of possibility and what kinds are not, only the theory of
evolution can tell us. Though we may not be able to write down an exhaustive list of the possibilities,
any specific question we shall, in principle, be able to answer.
For our present purposes we may disregard the fact that in one respect the theory of evolution is still
incomplete because we still know only little about the mechanism of mutation. But let us assume that
we knew precisely the circumstances in which (or at least the probability that in given conditions) a
particular mutation will appear, and that we similarly knew also the precise advantages which any such
mutation would in any particular kind of environment confer upon an individual of a specific
constitution. This would not enable us to explain why the existing species or organisms have the
particular structures which they possess, nor to predict what new forms will spring from them.
The reason for this is the actual impossibility of ascertaining the particular circumstances which, in the
course of two billion years, have decided the emergence of the existing forms, or even those which,
during the next few hundred years, will determine the selection of the types which will survive. Even if
we tried to apply our explanatory scheme to a single species consisting of a known number of
individuals each of which we were able to observe, and assuming that we were able to ascertain and
record every single relevant fact, their sheer number would be such that we should never be able to
manipulate them, i.e., to insert these data into the appropriate blanks of our theoretical formula and then
to solve the 'statement equations' thus determined.25
What we have said about the theory of evolution applies to most of the rest of biology. The theoretical
understanding of the growth and functioning of organisms can only in the rarest of instances be turned
into specific predictions of what will happen in a particular case, because we can hardly ever ascertain
all the facts which will contribute to determine the outcome. Hence, 'prediction and control, usually
regarded as essential criteria of science, are less reliable in biology'.26 It deals with pattern-building
forces, the knowledge of which is useful for creating conditions favourable to the production of certain
kinds of results, while it will only in comparatively few cases be possible to control all the relevant
circumstances.

6. Theories of Social Structures
It should not be difficult now to recognize the similar limitations applying to theoretical explanations of
the phenomena of mind and society. One of the chief results so far achieved by theoretical work in
these fields seems to me to be the demonstration that here individual events regularly depend on so
many concrete circumstances that we shall never in fact be in a position to ascertain them all ; and that
in consequence not only the ideal of prediction and control must largely remain beyond our reach, but
also the hope remain illusory that we can discover by observation regular connections between the
individual events. The very insight which theory provides, for example, that almost any event in the
course of a man's life may have some effect on almost any of his future actions, makes it impossible
that we translate our theoretical knowledge into predictions of specific events. There is no justification
for the dogmatic belief that such translation must be possible if a science of these subjects is to be
achieved, and that workers in these sciences have merely not yet succeeded in what physics has done,
namely to discover simple relations between a few observables. If the theories which we have yet
achieved tell us anything, it is that no such simple regularities are to be expected.
I will not consider here the fact that in the case of mind attempting to explain the detail of the working
of another mind of the same order of complexity, there seems to exist, in addition to the merely
'practical' yet nevertheless unsurmountable obstacles, also an absolute impossibility: because the
conception of a mind fully explaining itself involves a logical contradiction. This I have discussed
elsewhere.27 It is not relevant here because the practical limits determined by the impossibility of
ascertaining all the relevant data lie so far inside the logical limits that the latter have little relevance to
what in fact we can do.
In the field of social phenomena only economics and linguistics28 seem to have succeeded in building
up a coherent body of theory. I shall confine myself here to illustrating the general thesis with reference
to economic theory, though most of what I have to say would appear to apply equally to linguistic
theory.
Schumpeter well described the task of economic theory when he wrote that 'the economic life of a nonsocialist society consists of millions of relations or flows between individual firms and households. We
can establish certain theorems about them, but we can never observe them all.'29 To this must be added
that most of the phenomena in which we are interested, such as competition, could not occur at all
unless the number of distinct elements involved were fairly large, and that the overall pattern that will
form itself is determined by the significantly different behaviour of the different individuals so that the
obstacle of obtaining the relevant data cannot be overcome by treating them as members of a statistical
collective.
For this reason economic theory is confined to describing kinds of patterns which will appear if certain
general conditions are satisfied, but can rarely if ever derive from this knowledge any predictions of
specific phenomena. This is seen most clearly if we consider those systems of simultaneous equations
which since Léon Walras have been widely used to represent the general relations between the prices
and the quantities of all commodities bought and sold. They are so framed that if we were able to fill in
all the blanks, i.e., if we knew all the parameters of these equations, we could calculate the prices and
quantities of all the commodities. But, as at least the founders of this theory clearly understood, its
purpose is not 'to arrive at a numerical calculation of prices', because it would be 'absurd' to assume that
we can ascertain all the data.30
The prediction of the formation of this general kind of pattern rests on certain very general factual
assumptions (such as that most people engage in trade in order to earn an income, that they prefer a
larger income to a smaller one, that they are not prevented from entering whatever trade they wish, etc.,
- assumptions which determine the scope of the variables but not their particular values); it is, however,

not dependent on the knowledge of the more particular circumstances which we would have to know in
order to be able to predict prices or quantities of particular commodities. No economist has yet
succeeded in making a fortune by buying or selling commodities on the basis of his scientific
prediction of future prices (even though some may have done so by selling such predictions).
To the physicist it often seems puzzling why the economist should bother to formulate those equations
although admittedly he sees no chance of determining the numerical values of the parameters which
would enable him to derive from them the values of the individual magnitudes. Even many economists
seem loath to admit that those systems of equations are not a step towards specific predictions of
individual events but the final results of their theoretical efforts, a description merely of the general
character of the order we shall find under specifiable conditions which, however, can never be
translated into a prediction of its particular manifestations.
Predictions of a pattern are nevertheless both testable and valuable. Since the theory tells us under
which general conditions a pattern of this sort will form itself, it will enable us to create such
conditions and to observe whether a pattern of the kind predicted will appear. And since the theory tells
us that this pattern assures a maximization of output in a certain sense, it also enables us to create the
general conditions which will assure such a maximization, though we are ignorant of many of the
particular circumstances which will determine the pattern that will appear.
It is not really surprising that the explanation of merely a sort of pattern may be highly significant in
the field of complex phenomena but of little interest in the field of simple phenomena, such as those of
mechanics. The fact is that in studies of complex phenomena the general patterns are all that is
characteristic of those persistent wholes which are the main object of our interest, because a number of
enduring structures have this general pattern in common and nothing else.31
7. The Ambiguity of the Claims of Determinism
The insight that we will sometimes be able to say that data of a certain class (or of certain classes) will
bring about a pattern of a certain kind, but will not be able to ascertain the attributes of the individual
elements which decide which particular form the pattern will assume, has consequences of considerable
importance. It means, in the first instance, that when we assert that we know how something is
determined, this statement is ambiguous. It may mean that we merely know what class of
circumstances determines a certain kind of phenomena, without being able to specify the particular
circumstances which decide which member of the predicted class of patterns will appear; or it may
mean that we can also explain the latter. Thus we can reasonably claim that a certain phenomenon is
determined by known natural forces and at the same time admit that we do not know precisely how it
has been produced. Nor is the claim invalidated that we can explain the principle on which a certain
mechanism operates if it is pointed out that we cannot say precisely what it will do at a particular place
and time. From the fact that we do know that a phenomenon is determined by certain kinds of
circumstances it does not follow that we must be able to know even in one particular instance all the
circumstances which have determined all its attributes.
There may well be valid and more grave philosophical objections to the claim that science can
demonstrate a universal determinism; but for all practical purposes the limits created by the
impossibility of ascertaining all the particular data required to derive detailed conclusions from our
theories are probably much narrower. Even if the assertion of a universal determinism were
meaningful, scarcely any of the conclusions usually derived from it would therefore follow. In the first
of the two senses we have distinguished we may, for instance, well be able to establish that every single
action of a human being is the necessary result of the inherited structure of his body (particularly of its
nervous system) and of all the external influences which have acted upon it since birth. We might even

be able to go further and assert that if the most important of these factors were in a particular case very
much the same as with most other individuals, a particular class of influences will have a certain kind
of effect. But this would be an empirical generalization based on a ceteris paribus assumption which
we could not verify in the particular instance. The chief fact would continue to be, in spite of our
knowledge of the principle on which the human mind works, that we should not be able to state the full
set of particular facts which brought it about that the individual did a particular thing at a particular
time. The individual personality would remain for us as much a unique and unaccountable phenomenon
which we might hope to influence in a desirable direction by such empirically developed practices as
praise and blame, but whose specific actions we could generally not predict or control, because we
could not obtain the information on all the particular facts which determined it.
8. The Ambiguity of "Relativism
The same sort of misconception underlies the conclusions derived from the various kinds of
'relativism'. In most instances these relativistic positions on questions of history, culture, or ethics are
derived from the erroneous interpretations of the theory of evolution which we have already
considered. But the basic conclusion that the whole of our civilization and all human values are the
result of a long process of evolution in the course of which values, as the aims of human activity
appeared, continue to change, seems inescapable in the light of our present knowledge. We are
probably also entitled to conclude that our present values exist only as the elements of a particular
cultural tradition and are significant only for some more or less long phase of evolution-whether this
phase includes some of our pre-human ancestors or is confined to certain periods of human civilization.
We have no more ground to ascribe to them eternal existence than to the human race itself. There is
thus one possible sense in which we may legitimately regard human values as relative and speak of the
probability of their further evolution.
But it is a far cry from this general insight to the claims of the ethical, cultural, or historical relativists
or of evolutionary ethics. To put it crudely: while we know that all those values are relative to
something, we do not know to what they are relative. We may be able to indicate the general class of
circumstances which have made them what they are, but we do not know the particular conditions to
which the values we hold are due, or what our values would be if those circumstances had been
different. Most of the illegitimate conclusions are the result of the erroneous interpretation of the theory
of evolution as the empirical establishment of a trend. Once we recognize that it gives us no more than
a scheme of explanation which might be sufficient to explain particular phenomena if we knew all the
facts which have operated in the course of history, it becomes evident that the claims of the various
kinds of relativism (and of evolutionary ethics) are unfounded. Though we may meaningfully say that
our values are determined by a class of circumstances definable in general terms, so long as we cannot
state which particular circumstances have produced the existing values, or what our values would be
under any specific set of other circumstances, no significant conclusions follow from the assertion.
It deserves brief notice in passing how radically opposed are the practical conclusions which are
derived from the same evolutionary approach according as it is assumed that we can or cannot in fact
know enough about the circumstances to derive specific conclusions from our theory. While the
assumption of a sufficient knowledge of the concrete facts generally produces a sort of intellectual
hubris which deludes itself that reason can judge all values, the insight into the impossibility of such
full knowledge induces an attitude of humility and reverence towards that experience of mankind as a
whole that has been precipitated in the values and institutions of existing society.
A few observations ought to be added here about the obvious significance of our conclusions for
assessing the various kinds of 'reductionism'. In the sense of the first of the distinctions which we have

repeatedly made - in the sense of general description - the assertion that biological or mental
phenomena are 'nothing but' certain complexes of physical events, or that they are certain classes of
structures of such events, these claims are probably defensible. But in the second sense - � specific
prediction - which alone would justify the more ambitious claims made for reductionism, they are
completely unjustified. A full reduction would be achieved only if we were able to substitute for a
description of events in biological or mental terms a description in physical terms which included an
exhaustive enumeration of all the physical circumstances which constitute a necessary and sufficient
condition of the biological or mental phenomena in question. In fact such attempts always consist - and
can consist only - in the illustrative enumeration of classes of events, usually with an added 'etc.', which
might produce the phenomenon in question. Such 'eta-reductions' are not reductions which enable us to
dispense with the biological or mental entities, or to substitute for them a statement of physical events,
but are mere explanations of the general character of the kind of order or pattern whose specific
manifestations we know only through our concrete experience of them.32
9. The Importance of Our Ignorance
Perhaps it is only natural that in the exuberance generated by the successful advances of science the
circumstances which limit our factual knowledge, and the consequent boundaries imposed upon the
applicability of theoretical knowledge, have been rather disregarded. It is high time, however, that we
take our ignorance more seriously. As Popper and others have pointed out, 'the more we learn about the
world, and the deeper our learning, the more conscious, specific, and articulate will be our knowledge
of what we do not know, our knowledge of our ignorance'.33 We have indeed in many fields learnt
enough to know that we cannot know all that we would have to know for a full explanation of the
phenomena.
These boundaries may not be absolute. Though we may never know as much about certain complex
phenomena as we can know about simple phenomena, we may partly pierce the boundary by
deliberately cultivating a technique which aims at more limited objectives - the explanation not of
individual events but merely of the appearance of certain patterns or orders. Whether we call these
mere explanations of the principle or mere pattern predictions or higher-level theories does not matter.
Once we explicitly recognize that the understanding of the general mechanism which produces patterns
of a certain kind is not merely a tool for specific predictions but important in its own right, and that it
may provide important guides to action (or sometimes indications of the desirability of no action), we
may indeed find that this limited knowledge is most valuable.
What we must get rid of is the naive superstition that the world must be so organized that it is possible
by direct observation to discover simple regularities between all phenomena and that this is a necessary
presupposition for the application of the scientific method. What we have by now discovered about the
organization of many complex structures should be sufficient to teach us that there is no reason to
expect this, and that if we want to get ahead in these fields our aims will have to be somewhat different
from what they are in the fields of simple phenomena.
10. A Postscript on the Role of 'Laws' in the Theory of Complex Phenomena34
Perhaps it deserves to be added that the preceding considerations throw some doubt on the widely held
view that the aim of theoretical science is to establish 'laws' - at least if the word 'law' is used as
commonly understood. Most people would probably accept some such definition of 'law' as that 'a
scientific law is the rule by which two phenomena are connected with each other according to the
principle of causality, that is to say, as cause and effect.'35 And no less an authority than Max Planck is

reported to have insisted that a true scientific law must be expressible in a single equation.36
Now the statement that a certain structure can assume only one of the (still infinite) number of states
defined by a system of many simultaneous equations is still a perfectly good scientific (theoretical and
falsifiable) statement.37 We might still call, of course, such a statement a 'law', if we so wish (though
some people might rightly feel that this would do violence to language); but the adoption of such a
terminology would be likely to make us neglectful of an important distinction: for to say that such a
statement describes, like an ordinary law, a relation between cause and effect would be highly
misleading. It would seem, therefore, that the conception of law in the usual sense has little application
to the theory of complex phenomena, and that therefore also the description of scientific theories as
'nomologic' or 'nomothetic' (or by the German term Gesetzeswissenschaften) is appropriate only to
those two-variable or perhaps three-variable problems to which the theory of simple phenomena can be
reduced, but not to the theory of phenomena which appear only above a certain level of complexity. If
we assume that all the other parameters of such a system of equations describing a complex structure
are constant, we can of course still call the dependence of one of the latter on the other a 'law' and
describe a change in the one as 'the cause' and the change in the other as 'the effect'. But such a 'law'
would be valid only for one particular set of values of all the other parameters and would change with
every change in any one of them. This would evidently not be a very useful conception of a 'law', and
the only generally valid statement about the regularities of the structure in question is the whole set of
simultaneous equations from which, if the values of the parameters are continuously variable, an
infinite number of particular laws, showing the dependence of one variable upon another, could be
derived.
In this sense we may well have achieved a very elaborate and quite useful theory about some kind of
complex phenomenon and yet have to admit that we do not know of a single law, in the ordinary sense
of the word, which this kind of phenomenon obeys. I believe this to be in a great measure true of social
phenomena: though we possess theories of social structures, I rather doubt whether we know of any
'laws' which social phenomena obey. It would then appear that the search for the discovery of laws is
not an appropriate hall-mark of scientific procedure but merely a characteristic of the theories of simple
phenomena as we have defined these earlier; and that in the field of complex phenomena the term 'law'
as well as the concepts of cause and effect are not applicable without such modification as to deprive
them of their ordinary meaning.
In some respect the prevalent stress on 'laws', i.e., on the discovery of regularities in two-variable
relations, is probably a result of inductivism, because only such simple co-variation of two magnitudes
is likely to strike the senses before an explicit theory or hypothesis has been formed. In the case of
more complex phenomena it is more obvious that we must have our theory first before we can ascertain
whether the things do in fact behave according to this theory. It would probably have saved much
confusion if theoretical science had not in this manner come to be identified with the search for laws in
the sense of a simple dependence of one magnitude upon another. It would have prevented such
misconception as that, e.g., the biological theory of evolution proposed some definite 'law of evolution'
such as a law of the necessary sequence of certain stages or forms. It has of course done nothing of the
kind and all attempts to do this rest on a misunderstanding of Darwin's great achievement. And the
prejudice that in order to be scientific one must produce laws may yet prove to be one of the most
harmful of methodological conceptions. It may have been useful to some extent for the reason given by
Popper, that 'simple statements ... are to be prized more highly'38 in all fields where simple statements
are significant. But it seems to me that there will always be fields where it can be shown that all such
simple statements must be false and where in consequence also the prejudice in favour of 'laws' must be
harmful.

Notes
1. See already Aristotle, Metaphysics; I, 11, 9, 9826b (Loeb ed. p. ij): 'It is through wonder that
men now begin and originally began to philosophize ... it is obvious that they pursued science
for the sake of knowledge, and not for any practical utility' ; also Adam Smith, "The Principles
which Lead and Direct Philosophical Inquiries, as Illustrated by the History of Astronomy', in
Essays, London, 1869, p. 340: 'Wonder, therefore, and not any expectation of advantage from its
discoveries, is the first principle which prompts mankind to the study of philosophy, that
science which pretends to lay open the concealed connections that unite the various appearances
of nature; and they pursue this study for its own sake, as an original pleasure or good in itself,
without regarding its tendency to procure them the means of many other pleasures.' Is there
really any evidence for the now popular contrary view that, e.g., 'hunger in the Nile Valley led
to the development of geometry' (as Gardner Murphy in the Handbook of Social Psychology,
ed. by Gardner Lindzey, 1954, Vol. II, p. 616, tells us) ? Surely the fact that the discovery of
geometry turned out to be useful does not prove that it was discovered because of its usefulness.
On the fact that economics has in some degree been an exception to the general rule and has
suffered by being guided more by need than by detached curiosity, see my lecture on "The
Trend of Economic Thinking' in Economica, 1933.

See K. R. Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, London, 1957, p. 121 : 'Science . . . cannot start
with observations, or with the "collection of data", as some students of method believe. Before
we can collect data, our interest in data of a certain kind assist be aroused: the problem always
comes first.' Also in his The Logic of Scientific Discovery, London, 1959, p. 59: Observation is
always observation in the light of theories'

3. Although in some respects the capacity of our senses for pattern recognition clearly also
exceeds the capacity of our mind for specifying these patterns. The question of the extent to
which this capacity of our senses is the result of another kind of (pre-sensory) experience is
another matter. See, on this and on the general point that all perception involves a theory or
hypothesis, my book The Sensory Order, London and Chicago, 1952, esp. para. 7.37. Cf. also
the remarkable thought expressed by Adam Ferguson (and probably derived from George
Berkeley) in The History of Civil Society, London, 1767, p. 39, that 'the inferences of thought
are sometimes not to be distinguished from the perception of sense'; as well as H. von
Helmholtz's theory of the 'unconscious inferences' involved in most perceptions. For a recent
revival of these ideas see N. R. Hanson, Patterns of Discovery, Cambridge University Press,
1958, esp. p. 19, and the views on the role of 'hypotheses' in perception as developed in recent
'cognition theory' by J. S. Bruner, L. Postman and others.

Study of Human Behavior', Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, I, 1956, p. 332 :
"The difference between the scientific study of behavior and that of physical phenomena is thus
partly due to the relatively greater complexity of the simplest phenomena we are concerned to
account for in a behavioral theory.'
8. Ernest Nagel, The Structure of Science, New York, 1961, p. 505: 'though social phenomena may
indeed be complex, it is by no means certain that they are in general more complex than
physical and biological phenomena.' See, however, Johann von Neumann, "The General and
Logical Theory of Automata', Cerebral Mechanism in Behavior. The Hixon Symposium, New
York, 195 1, p. 24: 'we are dealing here with parts of logic with which we have practically no
experience. The order of complexity is out of all proportion to anything we have ever known.' It
may be useful to give here a few illustrations of the orders of magnitude with which biology
and neurology have to deal. While the total number of electrons in the Universe has been
estimated at io79 and the number of electrons and protons at 10^sup 100^, there are in
chromosomes with 1,000 locations [genes] with 10 allelomorphs 10^sup 1000^ possible
combinations; and the number of possible proteins is estimated at 10^sup 2700^ (L. von
Bertalanffy, Problems of Life, New York, 1952, p. 103). C. Judson Herrick {Brains of Rats and
Men, New York), suggests that 'during a few minutes of intense cortical activity the number of
interneuronic connections actually made (counting also those that are actuated more than once
in different associational patterns) may well be as great as the total number of atoms in the solar
system' (i.e. 10^sup 56^); and Ralph W. Gerard {Scientific American, September 1953, p. 118)
has estimated that in the course of seventy years a man may accumulate 15 � 10^sup 12^ units
of information ('bits'), which is more than 1,000 times larger than the number of nerve cells.
The further complications which social relations superimpose upon this are, of course, relatively
insignificant. But the point is that if we wanted to 'reduce' social phenomena to physical events,
they would constitute an additional complication, superimposed upon that of the physiological
processes determining mental events.

21. Even Professor Popper seems to imply this interpretation when he writes {Poverty of
Historicism, p. 107) that 'the evolutionary hypothesis is not a universal law of nature but a
particular (or, more precisely, singular) historical statement about the ancestry of a number of
terrestrial plants and animals'. If this means that the essence of the theory of evolution is the
assertion that particular species had common ancestors, or that the similarity of structure always
means a common ancestry (which was the hypothesis from which the theory of evolution was
derived), this is emphatically not the main content of the present theory of evolution. There is,
incidentally, some contradiction between Popper's treatment of the concept of 'mammals' as a
universal (Logic, p. 65) and the denial that the evolutionary hypothesis describes a universal
law of nature. The same process might have produced mammals on other planets.

science learns one answer, it is characteristically true that it also learns several new questions. It
is as though science were working in a great forest of ignorance, making an ever larger circular
clearing within which, not to insist on the pun, things are clear. . . . But, as that circle becomes
larger and larger, the circumference of contact with ignorance also gets longer and longer.
Science learns more and more. But there is an ultimate sense in which it does not gain ; for the
volume of the appreciated but not understood keeps getting larger. We keep, in science, getting
a more and more sophisticated view of our ignorance.'

36. Sir Karl Popper comments on this that it seems extremely doubtful whether any single one of
Maxwell's equations could be said to express anything of real significance if we knew none of
the others; in fact, it seems that the repeated occurrence of the symbols in the various equations
is needed to secure that these symbols have the intended meanings.
37. Cf. K. R. Popper, Logic of Scientific Discovery, � 17, p. 73 : 'Even if the system of equations
does not suffice for a unique solution, it does not allow every conceivable combination of
values to be substituted for the "unknowns" (variables). Rather, the system of equations
characterizes certain combinations of values or value systems as admissible, and others as
inadmissible; it distinguishes the class of admissible value systems from the ckss of
inadmissible value systems.' Note also the application of this in the following passages to
'statement equations'.
